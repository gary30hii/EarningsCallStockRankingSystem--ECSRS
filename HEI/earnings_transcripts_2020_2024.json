I'd now turn the call over to Laurans A. Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO fourth quarter and full fiscal 2020 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Erich Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macao, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now before reviewing our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the impact on HEICO\u2019s operating results from the COVID-19 global pandemic. The results of operations in fiscal 2020 were significantly affected by COVID-19 global pandemic. The effects of the pandemic, and related actions by governments around the world, to mitigate its spread has impacted our employees, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers. Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, we have implemented health and safety measures at our facilities in accordance with the CDC guidelines to protect team members and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Most of our facilities are considered essential businesses and have remained operational during the pandemic. We are thankful for the outstanding commitment of our team members towards our customers, shareholders, and each other during these very challenging times. The board of directors and management of HEICO are truly humbled by the dedication of our team members to their company during these unprecedented times. Currently, we believe the recent vaccine progress will most notably result in a gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services, commencing in fiscal 2021. As demand for air travel slowly recovers, we remained very confident in our ability to offer cost saving solutions and robust product development programs that we expect to increase our market share and allow us to have even a stronger presence within the commercial aviation market. I'd like to take a few moments to summarize the highlights of our full fiscal 2020 and fourth quarter results. Despite the many challenges faced in fiscal 2020, HEICO has continued to generate excellent cash flow. Our cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong at $409 million and $437.4 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $110.2 million or 177% of reported net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $124 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As all of you know, HEICO\u2019s most important metric is cash flow. And I think that the results of 2020 operations, particularly the fourth quarter, are clearly indicative of the success. We are encouraged by the sequential improvements in our fiscal 2020 consolidated fourth quarter operating results over the third quarter of fiscal 2020. And during the fourth quarter, we experienced increases in consolidated operating income, net income, and net sales of 30%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. In fact, despite the continued impact of the pandemic on demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services, the Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income, and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 improved sequentially, by 78% and 9% respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, a significant improvement. The Electronic Technologies Group and from now on, I'll call it ETG, set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, improving 8% and 14% respectively, over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases principally reflect the excellent operating performance of our fiscal 2020 acquisitions, as well as continued disciplined cost management on the part of our operating teams. We recently entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit agreement by one year to November 23, and to increase the committed capital to $1.5 billion. In addition, our credit facility continues to include a feature that will allow the company to increase the capacity by 350 million or become a $1.85 billion facility through increased commitments from existing vendors or the addition of new lenders and can be extended for an additional one-year period.  We are very thankful for the continued support of our existing Bank Group. Their loyalty to HEICO is demonstrated by this credit facility amendment further offers us the financial flexibility to pursue our disciplined strategy of acquiring high quality businesses at fair prices. Our net debt, which we define as total debt, less cash, and cash equivalents of $333 million, compared to shareholders equity ratio improved to 16.6% as of October 31, 2020, and this was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.71 times as of October 31, 2020, down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. Keep in mind this is after making six acquisitions during the year. During fiscal 2020, we successfully completed six acquisitions, four of which were completed since the pandemic start. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2024. And we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes and accelerate growth to maximize shareholder returns. As we reported yesterday, we declared an $0.08 per share regular semi-annual cash dividend on both classes of common stock payable January 21, 2021 to shareholders of record as of January 7, 2021. This cash dividend will be our 85th consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. HEICO\u2019s strength in the phase of challenging business conditions, coupled with our optimism of the future, gave our Board of Directors the confidence to continue paying our normal cash dividend. While this is very important to all of our shareholders, it is especially important to our team members, the vast majority of whom are fellow HEICO shareholders through the personal holdings in their 401(k) plan. Let's talk about some of the new fourth quarter acquisitions. As I discussed during the third quarter teleconference, we completed three acquisitions in August through our ETG Group. First, we acquired a 75% of the equity interest in transformational security and intelligent devices. These two companies design and develop and manufacture, state of the art technical surveillance countermeasures equipment. Next, we acquired approximately 90% of the equity interest of Connect Tech. Connect Tech designs and manufactures rugged, small form factor embedded computing solutions used in rugged commercial and industrial, aerospace and defense, transportation and smart energy applications. These acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. \nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales were $924.8 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to $1,240.2 million in fiscal year 2019. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $193.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $324.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The net sales decreases are principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines, resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020, due to the pandemic. Net sales in fiscal 2020 follows the 13% and 12% organic growth reported in the year in fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 respectively. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income was $143.1 million in fiscal 2020, as compared to $242 million in the fiscal year 2019. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income was $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $62.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreases principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales, a lower gross profit margin and an increase in bad debt expense due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2020 as a result of the pandemic\u2019s financial impact, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation expense. The lower gross profit margin principally reflects an increase in inventory obsolescence expense, mainly resulting from the announced retirement of certain aircraft types in engine platforms by our commercial aerospace customers due to the pandemic's financial impact. Additionally, the lower gross profit margin reflects the impact from lower net sales within our repair and overhaul parts and services and aftermarket replacement parts product lines. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin was 15.5% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 19.5% in fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin was 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to 19.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease that the operating margin decreases principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned, higher bad debt expense in fixed cost efficiencies loss resulting from the pandemic's impact, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 5% to a record $875 million in fiscal 2020, up from $834.5 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in fiscal 2020 is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 1%. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower sales of commercial aerospace and medical products, largely attributable to the pandemic, partially offset by increased sales of defense and space products.  The ETG\u2019s net sales increased 8% to a record $236.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $219.5 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 acquisitions, and the anticipated increase in commercial space revenues. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 5% to a record $258.8 million in fiscal 2020, up from $245.7 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, lower performance-based compensation expense, and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales and less favorable product mix of certain commercial aerospace and medical products, partially offset by increased net sales of certain defense products. The ETG\u2019s operating income increased 14% to a record $73.9 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, up from $64.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects a more favorable product mix and increased net sales of certain space and defense products, partially offset by a decrease in net sales of certain commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 29.6% in fiscal 2020, up from 29.4% in fiscal 2019. The ETG\u2019s operating margin improved to 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 29.4% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly reflects efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth and the improved gross profit margin. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 4% to $2.29 in fiscal 2020, as compared to $2.39 in fiscal 2019. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 27% to $0.45 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Those decreases principally reflect the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support, partially offset by lower income tax expense, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest, as well as lower interest expense. Depreciation amortization expense totaled 88.6 million in fiscal 2020, up from 83.5 million in fiscal 2019, and totaled 23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 21.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in the fiscal year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflect the incremental impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions.  Research and development, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. R&D expense was 65.6 million in fiscal 2020, or about 3.7% of net sales, and that compared to 66.6 million in fiscal 2019 or 3.2% of net sales. R&D expense was 16.6 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 or 3.9% of net sales, and that compared to 17.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and that was 3.3% of net sales.  SG&A expenses consolidated decreased by 14% to 305.5 million in fiscal 2020 and that was down from 356.7 in fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in fiscal 2020 reflects a decrease in performance based compensation expense, a reduction in other G&A expenses, and a reduction in other selling expenses, including outside sales commissions, marketing and travel. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, as well as the previously mentioned increase in bad debt expense, and that was due to collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2020 as a result of the financial impact of the pandemic. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 18% to 72.6 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, down from 88.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&AA expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects a reduction in other general and administrative expense, decrease in performance based compensation expense, and the reduction in other selling expenses including outside sales commission marketing and travel. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, as well as the increase in bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales dropped to 17.1% in fiscal 2020 and that was down slightly from 17.4% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2020 again is due to lower performance based compensation expense and a decrease in other selling expenses, partially offset by the impact of higher other G&A expense as a percentage of net sales and an increase in bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 17% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, and that was up slightly from 16.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects higher other general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales due to the decreased sales volume and the aforementioned increase in debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in lower performance based compensation expense and a decrease in other selling expenses. Interest expense decreased to 13.2 million in fiscal 2020, and that was down significantly from 21.7 million in fiscal 2019, and a decreased to 2.5 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, down from 5.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Decreases were principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 was 7.9%, as compared to 17.8% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2020 is mainly attributable to a larger tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2020 from stock option exercises, compared to fiscal 2019 and that resulted from more stock options being exercised, as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option-ease holding period. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was 22.3%, and that compared to 19.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 21.9 million in fiscal 2020, and that compared to 31.8 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2020, principally reflects a decrease in operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support, in which non-controlling interest are [held], as well as the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019, that effectively resulted in the transfer of 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries, and that was transferred back to our Flight Support Group. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. And that compared to 6.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interest are held. For the full-fiscal year 2021 at the present time, we anticipate a combined tax and non-controlling interest rate of approximately 23% to 24%. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, as you will know our financial position and forecasted cash flow remained very strong, previously, I mentioned cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $409.1 million and 437.4 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled 110.2 million or 177% of net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to 124 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in fiscal 2021 and that would be up from the 22.9 million spent in fiscal 2020. Our working capital ratio, which is of course current assets divided by current liabilities improved to 4.8 as of October 31, 2020 as compared to 2.8 as of October 31, 2019. Days sales outstanding, DSOs of accounts receivable improved to 45 days as of October 31, 2020 and that compared favorably to the 47 days as of October 31, 2019. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of sales and our Top 5 customers represented approximately 24% and 20% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate increased to 153 days for the year ended October 31, 2020 as compared to 124 days for the year ended October 31, 2019. That increase in turnover rates principally reflect certain long-term and non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments, which were based on pre-pandemic net sales expectations and also to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now, the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal 2021, the pandemic will likely continue to negatively impact commercial aerospace industry as well as HEICO. Given this uncertainty, HEICO cannot provide fiscal 2021 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we do believe our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, healthy balance sheet, increased liquidity will permit us to invest in new research and development and gain market share as the industry recovers. In addition, our time tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring \u2013 operating high cash generating businesses across a diverse base of industry, besides commercial aerospace and these industries are defense, space, and other high-end markets, including electronics and medical, puts us in good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. We are cautiously optimistic that the recent vaccine progress should generate increased commercial air travel, and will result in a gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services commencing in fiscal 2021. I'd like to conclude my remarks by again thanking all of HEICO's talented team members who have worked very hard to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations during these difficult times, which were brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their dedication to HEICO's customers and to the safety of their fellow team members has been exemplary. And I want to thank each and every member of HEICO's global team to understand that the Board of Directors and I value your commitment to our collective safety and success during these challenging times. I am confident that our future is bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period as a stronger and more competitive company.  Those are the extent of my prepared remarks, and I would now like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. You may now ask your question.\nPeter Arment: Hi, yes. Good morning, Larry, Eric, Victor, Carlos. \nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson : Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Arment : Eric, I guess I just will start with you on FSG. The 9% sequential improvement, maybe you could just provide a little color of what you're seeing. I mean, we saw I guess a modest pickup in flight activity quarter-over-quarter, compared to the Q3, but what are you hearing from your or seeing from your customers in terms of their behavior?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah, I would say, we\u2019re \u2013 well, first of all, good morning, Peter, and thanks for your question. We are, I would say, very encouraged by seeing the pickup. Conversations with our customers remain very strong. They're very interested and excited about our product. We believe that we're going to come out of the pandemic with greater market share. In conversations with our sales VPs, I really question them on the particular products that we're coming out with, as well as why specifically, each one of them felt that we would be growing market share. And, you know, they claim that the conversations with the customers are causing them to understand that HEICO is viewed as a very significant part of the supply chain. We've matured into a nice sized company and there's no reason why they shouldn't be buying a greater number of our products.  So, I think we were correct when we called the bottom in May, expecting that May was going to be the bottom and that things were going to trend up. I can tell you that November was a very good month and things were looking very good. I would say, you know, for the last couple of \u2013 probably the last week or so, things have gotten a little quieter. But that's not necessarily atypical because normally around the holiday season things start to slow down. But I think, given the news that we see with the pandemic, it's sort of logical that the second half of December and January may be a bit quieter. But having said that, the vaccine news, of course was very good. And in looking \u2013 and speaking with our customers about the flight schedules that they're operating in the inventory that they have, you know, as I pointed out in our August call, the flight schedules were really far in excess of the spare parts purchases. And in discussions with a number of airlines, you know, they recognized that they can't continue to operate the schedules that they're operating based on the purchases that they're making.  So, we anticipate an improvement, in particular in the second half of our fiscal year. And obviously, the timing is going to be very dependent on the vaccine news, and, you know, what we see in terms of the infection rates.\nPeter Arment: No, that's really helpful. And you mentioned the bad debt expense. Can you quantify, like, what the margin would have been without that additional expense in FSG? \nCarlos Macau: Hey, Peter, this is Carlos. So, the additional bad debt wasn't that significant in the quarter, maybe [$1.5 million] something like that. Remember, we took about $7.5 million in Q3 to deal with some bankruptcies and in Q4, it was kind of the normal noise. So, you'd have to add about, I guess, [9 million] back to the annual margin to see what that would be.\nPeter Arment : Okay. And then, Carlos, just one quick one and then I'll jump back in queue. Larry mentioned SG&A was down 14% year-over-year, and I think over $30 million of it is tied to kind of performance comp. How do we think about that as we're thinking about fiscal 2021? \nCarlos Macau: I think that performance-based comp is going to [flux] with sales, Peter. So, I'm not anticipating getting back to 2019 performance-based comp levels in 2021. But they will [flux] with our sales and profitability. So as things pick up there in 2021, we'll probably see some increase in the bonus, and performance based comp expenses, but it will be commensurate with our profitability growth.\nPeter Arment: Thanks very much. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question. \nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Eric, with where airspace names are currently trading, have you considered increasing the multiple you would be willing to pay for a high-quality commercial air company, maybe a multiple that's higher than your historic norms? And then, as a follow-up, given the current valuation of HEICO stock, would you consider doing an all-stock or combination of cash and stock for a larger acquisition?\nEric Mendelson: So, good morning, Scott. So, with regard to the pricing, you know, I think that we're definitely flexible on pricing. I think that a lot of people \u2013 you know, frankly, there's a lot of private equity in the space right now, and they look at the results. You know, we've had this long cycle where commercial and defense have done very well. And we're, I think, very good at operating in this space and we understand where the landmines are. And I think that there are a number of companies out there which are being bid up at really, you know, prices that don't make sense. And so, to answer your question, if it's a high-quality company and we think that we can accelerate the growth, would we be more aggressive on it? Sure. However, if \u2013 you know, a lot of these businesses don't meet that criteria, and, you know, frankly, people look at HEICO and they say, well, you know, these guys didn't know what they were doing and they entered this business 31 years ago. Look at how well HEICO has performed with the stock. I don't know, it\u2019s 20% something CAGR over 31 years without any leverage, you know, how hard can this be? And, you know, they get into this space and they realize, in fact, it's pretty hard.  And we've got people who really know what they're doing and we've got this unique product offering where we're able to combine PMA, repair and distribution into the aftermarket, and have, you know, outside of a couple of the \u2013 you know, the airframe, engine or a couple of the large component OEMs. We've got the largest aftermarket sales force, and it's extremely synergistic where these businesses are able to feed business to each other and we've learned a tremendous amount along the way. So, \u2013 and then the other thing I would say, we're also fairly conservative when we look at them in terms of inventory reserves and in terms of not pressing, you know, the pricing on below \u2013 you know, we want to make sure that we've got a very good business for generations to come. And we're not trying to, you know, if you will, burn the furniture, you know, take everything out of the fields in order to hit our numbers. And that is the culture that we've created and our people understand that.  And so, I think that when you look at some companies that may really be doing things in the short-term in order to get a high price and then they want to get a high multiple of that, honestly, that's somewhat of a fool's errand and not something that we want to do. So sorry for the long answer, but if it truly is a HEICO run company, yes, you know, HEICO style run company, yes, we would pay a higher price for it. But frankly, we haven't \u2013 you know, you don't see that very often. So \u2013 and then, with regard to larger transactions, as our [debt] says, we \u2013 you know, HEICO is very open to all sorts of different transactions. We believe that we've got a differentiated model in terms of how we run the business and how we treat our people. And so, yes, if we found a larger deal, we would, you know, definitely want to go ahead and act on it. But, you know, of course, there can be no assurance and my comment should not be meant \u2013 should not be interpreted as there's one on the horizon. But we're always focused on where we can grow. And, you know, frankly, by having this culture, we really \u2013 you know, in a sense, it's like planting, you know, a lot of seeds in the ground to make sure that the future is going to be very good, and we've got that. And we're very confident on the future because of that. And even when a crisis happens like this, we treat our people very nicely because, you know, as we say, they are our greatest asset. And if you don't treat \u2013 other people may say, their people are the greatest asset and then they go and cut them and do all sorts of things, whereas HEICO has been willing to suffer the financial consequences of creating our people, right. You know, we're not afraid to go ahead and have reduced earnings so we can come out of this thing, very strong.  So acquisitions really need to line up like that and we've made a number of them, where, you know, typically the founder entrepreneurs share that same vision, where they really put the people ahead of short-term profits because they know that that leads to long term, you know, superiority. So, I hope that answers your question, but if not, I'd be happy to expand on it in any way.\nUnidentified Analyst: I guess just kind of on the follow up, if it were to be a larger acquisition say, in the north of a few billion dollars, would you consider doing all-stock or a combination of cash and stock to finance the acquisition?\nEric Mendelson: I think all things would be on the table. Frankly, it's our preference to use cash because we're believers in the stock. You know, the stock has performed extremely well. And if you look at the 82 acquisitions we\u2019ve made to-date, I don't think that we've given out more than a million dollars of stock and billions of dollars of acquisitions. So, now with the added flexibility that we've got with our new line of credit that, you know, Carlos worked so hard to arrange, we've got a lot of flexibility there. But yes, I mean, we would be open \u2013 I mean, one of the things that we need to be open to is some people may be concerned at selling it, if you will, you know, a lower point in the cycle. So therefore, they may request our stock as a way to be able to play, you know the up-cycle. So, I think in that case, we would be sensitive to it, but cash is definitely our preference.\nLaurans Mendelson : Yes, let me just add to that. You know, I think the bottom line to the whole thing is it depends on the deal; it depends on how much we want it; it depends on what the seller is looking for, and so forth. And we would consider giving stock under the right circumstances. As Eric says, we always prefer cash, and the reason we prefer cash is because when we make accretive acquisitions, the value of the whole company goes up. So whatever stock we give, really is \u2013 we've given out too much stock because the stock price goes up. So, it's better for all existing shareholders to \u2013 for us to use cash. But if there is a real [indiscernible] desirable acquisition, we're going to make that acquisition and we're going to do it in the best way we can. So we've definitely would consider cash stock or combination. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you and Happy Holidays, guys. \nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you. \nEric Mendelson : Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark. You may now ask your question.\nJosh Sullivan: Hi, good morning. \nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Josh. \nJosh Sullivan : Just on the other robust product development programs, you highlighted there in the opening remarks, can you just give us, you know, some color on the current pace of development? I know you outlined some R&D figures there, but have you increased the pace of PMA submissions? You know, do you think, you know, the aircraft type retirements makes you think differently about your PMA portfolio at this point?\nEric Mendelson: Hi. Yes, I would say that we maintain \u2013 this is Eric, we maintained our pace of PMA. You know, we could have increased it. I think one of the things which is \u2013 and why we've got, you know, plenty of opportunity, one of the things that we also have to be a little sensitive to is that a lot of people, including ourselves, took pay reductions this year. Some people were furloughed. There were some layoffs. And we wanted to be sensitive to make sure that the, if you will, the pain was \u2013 you know, the sacrifice was throughout the company. So while we could have increased new product development, you know, we kept it consistent thinking that that was really the right thing in order to show that everybody in the company was in this together. Having said that, I'm very proud that we've come out with, you know, the similar number of PMAs that we've done. I can tell you that we're very aggressively developing new products. Our subsidiaries really have a very good grasp on the products that they're going after and we continue to grow into adjacent whitespaces. Our airline customers and defense customers are very confident about the use of these products. So, I'm \u2013 you know, it gives me a great \u2013 you know, a great optimism for the future, especially when talking to our sales executives and going through the details with them and seeing why they too are very optimistic.\nJosh Sullivan: Yes. And then just, you know, as you look for that eventual rebound in commercial in the second half that you're expecting, outside of just a traffic recovery, you know, what kind of activity or class of products would you expect to see from the airlines picking up in the first half that would really give you, you know, confidence that the second half is going to work out as you're thinking it's going to?\nEric Mendelson: Well, I think, the first half is going to, sort of be a continuation of what we've seen, you know, frankly, since May, where we've been coming out of the bottom. You know, it sort of comes out in fits and starts and, you know, it moves ahead, then it sort of settles in and then it moves ahead and then it settles in. And I really would anticipate more of that type of progress, I would say, probably through \u2013 you know, or until perhaps the beginning or through our second quarter. Then what we've seen is, you know, when you talk to the airlines, they're operating the equipment in excess of what, you know the spare parts that they are purchasing. Early in the crisis, there was a destocking phenomenon. I don't really see that anymore. I think the airlines are now very much living hand to mouth and I think that destocking has occurred already. So, in terms of products going forward, I think, you know, it's going to be our standard mix of products. I think airlines will continue to try to defer expensive maintenance as much as possible, however, not in a way that would impact their \u2013 you know, the return to service of the equipment. So, I would say, in general, heavy maintenance and engine visits will be, if you will, the last to recover. And then, you know, with everything improving along the way sort of linear with a flight demand. You know, some of the line maintenance stuff needs to be replaced, even if they're not flying that much than the components. But again, the expensive stuff, we expect, would be definitely stacked to the later part of the recovery.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. You may now ask your question.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning. Just to follow up on, you know, one of your last points, I mean, you mentioned declines across product lines. I mean, any noticeable difference in the quarter between aftermarket replacement and repair and overall and what you're seeing in terms of recovery, given the sequential improvement in the quarter?\nEric Mendelson: You know, I would say it's similar. Oh! Good morning, Greg. This is Eric, I should say. I would say that it is similar between the replacement parts and the repair. You know, it's all in the same ballpark. One could be ahead or behind in a particular month or quarter, but it's all in the similar zip code, I would say.\nGreg Konrad : And then, maybe just one on ETG, can you maybe talk about the bridge for ETG margins, given some of the fiscal year 2020 drivers around lower performance-based compensation and net sales growth, which was somewhat offset by, you know, the gross margin pressures, which seem to reverse in Q4? How are you thinking about the trajectory there just given some of those moving pieces outside of volume?\nVictor Mendelson: Greg, this is Victor. I'm not sure I'm following the question, the trajectory for margins\u2026?\nGreg Konrad: Yes, just you had a really strong Q4 where some of the gross margin pressures seem to reverse, and, you know, you did over 31% margins, which were impressive. I mean, how do you think about, you know, mix and maybe lower performance-based compensation expense as kind of headwinds, tailwinds to fiscal year 2021? \nVictor Mendelson: Yes. I mean, I don't think of it very much in terms of performance-based compensation so much as the mix and the business is doing well, first, on their own independently and good margin performance at the operating level, the individual businesses. And if you look in the mix, as we had told you earlier in the year, we expected that our space revenues, commercial space revenues would be healthy, which they were, would be strong, which they were, that's a decent margin. Some of those operations are good margin operations for us, so I wouldn't say this was a surprise to us. And keep in mind, Greg that our margins \u2013 I mean we guide to this frequently in the ETG, our margins fluctuate over the course of the year. That is a typical year for us. This is nothing unusual for us and I would anticipate that's \u2013 the past is prelude and we don't really do anything to try to manage the margins or manage the earnings into a particular quarter or period. We really manage to maximize profitability, so this is a reflection of that.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you. \nVictor Mendelson: You're welcome. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. You may now ask your question. \nGautam Khanna : Hey, good morning, guys. Happy Holidays. \nLaurans Mendelson : Good morning.\nCarlos Macau: Good morning, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, just wanted to ask a couple of questions. First on ETG, I was curious \u2013 I think it was last quarter where you guys cited some order delays, some shipment delays, some lumpiness, if you will. That kind of dampened down the Q3 number and has that all been caught up now as of Q4? Or are you still seeing kind of a backlog built in that business? \nVictor Mendelson : Yes, I mean, with disruptions \u2013 this is Victor by the way.\nGautam Khanna: Yes.\nVictor Mendelson : And good morning. Look, that is continuing, that kind of thing and it just \u2013 it sort of \u2013 I would say it ebbs and flows a little bit. I would expect that with the pandemic's numbers, that COVID cases numbers rising, we may see more of that in a few months ahead, I don't know. But it comes through, you know, it's in supply chain; it can be on the customer side, where the customer doesn't show up to do an acceptance and test procedure or their transportation doesn't show up and can be a week or two late. It's nothing that fundamentally shifts the business and then eventually catches up and it seems to come and go with this pandemic. I through much of the fourth quarter, started to reappear again as the pandemic numbers began to increase later in October and, you know, I would expect that to be the case until this thing gets under control. And so, I'm optimistic that as it gets more under control with the vaccine, we'll see less of it. \nGautam Khanna: Okay. And a follow-up, Victor, on that, you know, Lockheed and some of the other \u2013 the defense primes have largely guided for next year and I just wanted to understand again, and years past, you've talked about kind of the relationship between ETG\u2019s sales growth and that of the defense large cap primes. Could you update us on sort of what that relationship is in terms of the lag because they're \u2013 you know, they're guiding low-to-mid single digits basically? I'm just wondering, when does ETG start to see that glide path, you know, in that [ballpark]?\nVictor Mendelson : Yes its \u2013 and it's a good question. Of course, keeping in mind that defense is about usually around half of the ETG\u2019s business that can fluctuate up and down a bit, but it's somewhere in that ballpark. And then, you've got the other markets that we serve, which are, of course, significant, which is a little different than the large defense primes, which are much more heavily defense, although you do see some commercial space in the defense primes as well in their numbers.  So, I think it's difficult to find a one-to-one correlation between the defense primes and our ETG businesses. And really what we do is we look down and we drill down into the individual businesses. We have and in turn the individual programs that they're on and the products that they're on. And to be honest with you, we don't always know. As you're aware, the products we make are respond to a specification, to a customer need, a specific customer need as opposed to their design or blueprint, let's say. And so, they'll tell us, as an example, they need something that does a very specific function and performs in a very specific area and we'll produce that and they may not tell us what is going on. Very often when we figure it out, we usually can figure it out, but they may not share with us exactly what it's going on. So, that's why there's not a one-to-one correlation to it.  As a rule of thumb, as we've said before, we don't think defense budgets grow to the sky, and that at some point, we see, you know, defense, as a rule of thumb, flatter than it was over the past, let's say, four years or so. And we'll just have to see how that all plays out. \nGautam Khanna : Okay. And may I ask Eric just a couple of questions. First, I was curious, you know, there's been this argument [floated that lessors] may become a bigger part of the market just given the airline financial challenges. And I wonder has there been any change [afoot] in terms of lessors or willingness to utilize PMA parts? Do they today and are you seeing any change in behavior where they're more open to utilizing more PMA?\nLaurans Mendelson: You know, that's a very good question. The answer is yes. We are making progress on lessors using HEICO parts. You know, we're very careful that when we go out, we don't promote PMA parts, we promote HEICO parts to the lessors, you know, given HEICO\u2019s market cap and technical capabilities, technical history, product success. So, we're very careful to promote HEICO in that way.  And we've had a number of, you know, very good successes. Number one, if airlines negotiate in a request, the right to be able to use HEICO parts or PMA parts, the ER parts upfront in the lease, very often, they're able to get that concession because the airlines know that the vast majority of airlines out there operate using these parts. So they\u2019re really \u2013 that is not a reduced marketability on the product, number one.  Number two, there are a number of lessors that are coming out and offering really like power by the hour, thrust by the hour, aircraft by the hour, where they take responsibility for the overhaul and maintenance of that particular product and those lessors are using our parts very aggressively.  So, we see \u2013 you know, so the answer is yes, we've seen progress. However, there is a lot of opportunity out there because there's been a fair number of leases that have been signed in the past were by airlines \u2013 some airlines where, if you will, [indiscernible] into giving away that right and now that certain lessors want to try to extract value in order to \u2013 you know, in order to, frankly make more money. So, the airlines need to be very vigilant in request to this upfront, and then they're able to get that concession.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And maybe just given the commentary around, you know, the amended credit agreement and some of the questions on M&A, I am curious if you think there's actually some opportunity for more transformational acquisitions? I mean, in other words, different profiles and what you've done over the past couple of years where it's more tuck-ins that or [plug-and-play], do you see any big swing opportunities, you know, multi-billion dollar assets that are available for sale and that you'd actually care to transact with? I'm just curious, like, does this shake out with COVID and everything else, shake loose some attractive assets that you could utilize your valuation to pounce upon [indiscernible] now?\nEric Mendelson : We\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time studying the market and we're aware of our peers. And I think if an opportunity ever presented itself, you know, we would certainly act on it. I think that we've got a very differentiated model where we treat our people extraordinarily well. And I think for a [seller], you know, whether it's a larger public company or a private company, I think that is a point of value in something which differentiates us. So, yes, we could use, you know, our balance sheet to go ahead and do that and I can tell you that we're always out looking and reviewing, you know, the market out there for these kind of opportunities. \nGautam Khanna: Okay, I apologize for asking [indiscernible].\nVictor Mendelson: Let me add one thing, we have a few 100 people on the line right now. So, let me give everybody on the line an open invitation, if they have a wonderful acquisition for us to make, if they want cash, if they want stock, whatever the [notes], whatever you want, if you've got a great company and you want a wonderful home, give us a call, and we're going to talk to you. So, you know, we'll use whatever medium of exchange is necessary to make a great acquisition.\nEric Mendelson: And that's regardless of size.\nVictor Mendelson: Right. It can be. We have \u2013 in the past, we've looked at some very large transactions, and we've been priced out of the market. Some of them were good; some of them were, you know, not so good, and \u2013 but we don't pay 14 or 12 times EBITDA, it's just \u2013 you know, that's not in our strategy. So, you know, and quite a bit, we've been able to grow compounded. The bottom line is 19% and stock price is [24]. So, we have a model which is somewhat unique and I think Eric described the very aptly. We really believe in the culture of HEICO.  What the analysts can't relate in their reports is the quality of the management. I must say that \u2013 and I'm not talking about myself or even Eric, or Victor, but the people who are team members of HEICO, in my opinion, are truly extraordinary individuals. They're entrepreneurial; they're smart; they watch every dollar; they work 24/7. And this is an asset that doesn't appear on the balance sheet and I think the great strength of HEICO lies in its very, very capable array of team members. And again, if any of them are on the phone, I want to thank them personally, but I do want the investing public to understand that this is a great, great asset that doesn't appear in a 10-K or Q or analyst reports. But to me, it's the culture that drives the bottom line and the success of HEICO.\nGautam Khanna: I appreciate that answer. One last one for me, and I apologize for taking so much time is, Eric, have you seen any competitive changes in the industry, you know, just given that there is more interest in the HEICO part portfolio, what are the OEMs doing to push back against that and that potential share loss if anything?\nEric Mendelson: You know, the OEMs, our competitors are doing what they've always done. And, you know, they \u2013 we have to fight very hard for each piece of business that we have. I would say nothing really has changed in the playbook. You know, HEICO has become a very well respected, distinguished competitor out there and I think we're continuing to gain share and we're doing very well, so there's really no change, you know, in that regard. You know, having said that, our strategy within the parts business is to take a minority market share. You know, we only go for a 30% market share. So, as long as we're able to pick up that market share, you know, at terms, which makes sense for our customers as well as for ourselves, we, you know, cap that market share, you know, around that level because we want to make sure that our competitors also have a very good, you know, business strategy for their market share.  So, I think that our competitors have got very good \u2013 you know, our OEM competitors have very good business plans. I think they're going to continue to do very well. And I think there's plenty of opportunity for HEICO in there as well.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you very much, guys. \nEric Mendelson : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. You may now ask your question.\nKen Herbert: Hi, good morning, and Happy Holidays, everybody.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Ken. Happy Holidays to you.\nKen Herbert : Thank you. First, Eric, if I could, I just wanted to see if we could unpack the comments that I think both you and Larry have made around expectations to be able to sort of take share coming out of this. I'm just curious if you could provide any specifics on what you're seeing today either in terms of maybe RFPs or code activity or maybe, you know, issues with availability of OEM parts or other things that give you increased confidence just beyond the environment that should obviously favor, you know, favor price and other aspects coming out of this? But is there anything more specific you would point to around the share gain confidence?\nEric Mendelson: I would say, it's really, Ken, the same things that you pointed out. It's price; it\u2019s having a competitor; it's having somebody else, you know, large and respected out in the field and that's really, I think, what's driving it. You know, the airlines entered this, you know, recession or this crisis very strong. And then, of course, as time has gone on, you know their business models have really been challenged. And when I speak with our sales folks, you know, they explain to me that, you know, frankly fear, uncertainty and doubt what our competitors, our OEM competitors try to push is reasons why not to buy our product really doesn't hold up. So, they believe that we're going to be able to develop additional products because that's what the customers are asking for. They want us to go into these other products; they want us to develop our \u2013 you know, broaden our product line; and they're willing to buy it. So, as a result, we go ahead and continue to develop it. It's not only on in the parts area, but it's also in the repair area as well. So, I think it will continue to be a very competitive market. But, you know, that's what really gives me the confidence that we're going to do quite well.\nKen Herbert: Okay. And as we think about the organic opportunities from an investment standpoint in FSG, it sounds like across the organization, you've obviously got the ability to step up investments. Are there any particular areas, Eric, you'd identify where you're seeing maybe a greater spending, and when I say areas, either, you know, expanding your distribution capabilities, expanding the, you know, maybe the repair capabilities or the PMA portfolio? Other areas that are maybe getting a little more investment from you or you're looking at, as perhaps a little more attractive coming out of this?\nEric Mendelson: No, I would say it's all of our areas are where we're continuing to invest. I mean, you hit on all of them, PMA repair and distribution, we see very good opportunities in all of those. I think that we provide a unique balance in all of those businesses. You know, there's obviously the nexus in how they connect across the top, which nobody else can bring. And then, in addition, you know, we operate them as small businesses where we're very knowledgeable about the details and that really helps our customers as well as, our manufacturers, our principals. And then, we've got the balance sheet of a larger organization, so we're able to compete, you know, like a larger company would. So, I think we're in a very unique space.\nKen Herbert: That's great. And if I could just one final one for Victor, it sounds like space \u2013 you're pretty \u2013 continue to be pretty optimistic on your space market, is it possible for you to, sort of break out the government versus commercial space, as they're sort of relative contribution within the segment? And maybe just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the commercial side in terms of opportunities or how you expect this to grow in 2021 for you?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure, Ken. You know, and by the way, I don't want to overstate space, it's been good for us this year. I think it's looking promising going into next year, but I don't want to overstate it to lead you to believe that it's going to be stratospheric, no pun intended. But, it is moving in the right direction for us and we have some good opportunities and we are pursuing them. And when I refer to space, by the way, we're referring two commercial space, in fact, and defense space is encompassed within the defense number that we report, so we don't actually break it out separately and that's why you hear us refer to that. And I would expect that the opportunities for us in the space markets are more in what I would consider some of the larger satellite markets or satellite opportunities, some of the constellations, actually, but some of the larger constellations, and less in the very new space, very, very small set market, I don't think that's going to be the big market for us. But there certainly is an increased interest in both satellite opportunities as well as Earth observation and space exploration that's benefited us and I think it will continue to benefit us. That doesn't mean, by the way, that we won't have periods where space \u2013 you know, we won't have quarters where space is lower for us. It is still a somewhat volatile realm, but overall, we like it and think it's moving in the right direction.\nKen Herbert: Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations on the strong year and the cash generation.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Ken.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. You may now ask your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and Happy Holidays.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nMichael Ciarmoli : Victor, maybe just to stay on ETG, what was the organic growth? I know it was negative in the quarter, do you actually have the organic growth number? And I know you're not going to give much detail on 2021, but do you think ETG, you know, can grow organically in 2021?\nVictor Mendelson: Let me take it in reverse order there. I think we can have organic growth in 2021, but it's early in the year, there are a lot of things that will dictate what happens there and which is why we didn't issue guidance on the year. But I \u2013 our companies are certainly working toward that and I would \u2013 I have optimism that we can accomplish that at this point, but I want to let the year get further in. But right now, I would be surprised if we don't get organic growth in fiscal 2021, but let's see how the year wears on and what happens.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay.\nVictor Mendelson : And in terms of 2020, Carlos, yes [indiscernible].\nCarlos Macau: How are you doing Michael? \nMichael Ciarmoli : Good.\nCarlos Macau: For the year, organic growth in ETG was roughly flattish to down a percent and that was principally driven by aerospace. Remember that roughly 10% or so of the segment is commercial aerospace and it's going to follow the same trend as our FSG segment, so that was down. Other businesses did above what we expect them to do this year, absent logistical challenges of COVID and some of the disruptions that Victor mentioned earlier. So, I share Victor's optimism for next year. I think that the businesses can grow. I think that the commercial aerospace portion of ETG will mimic the recovery patterns in the FSG and that will be a bit of an anchor, probably in the early part of the year and then pick up towards the end of 2021.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Thank you. Got it and that\u2019s helpful.\nEric Mendelson : And let me add, I mean, I can say that, internally, our businesses are budgeting for organic growth. But you know what, we're always, me, in particular, very cautious, very conservative, and I don't \u2013 you know, we like to over deliver, to be honest with you, outperform. And so, you know, I'd rather comment further on that as we get a little deeper into the year, but that's certainly what we're planning for internally.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Got it. And then, I don't know if it's Carlos or Eric, on the FSG margin, I guess, you know, taking out that bad debt expense, 11% or so last quarter, it looks like close to 12% this quarter. You know, I know, the first quarter is usually seasonally weaker, but should we expect kind of this continued margin progression as, you know, the market recovers? And if you do get that, that second half 2021 strength, I mean can we expect you guys to get into the teens? You know, I don't expect you to get all the way back up to the upper teens 20% or maybe a total recovery, but is that the right way to think about the margin progression for FSG?\nCarlos Macau: I think \u2013 Michael this is Carlos. I think you're on the right path. So, as Eric mentioned earlier, we are thinking about next year in terms of a bit of a continuation of what we saw in Q4 into the early part of 2021 with a gradual progression upwards towards the back end of 2021. And I think during that back-end period, you'll see our margins improve and I think in the early part of the year, you should see them slightly improve. So, I \u2013 could we get to the low teens? Yes. I mean, I think that's definitely in the cards for us, and obviously, we hope to do better. But, you know, when we have more visibility, Michael, on next year, we'll \u2013 you know, I'm hopeful we could restore guidance at some point. But when we do at that point, I'll give you all the details you need. But right now, what I've told you is about all I can [indiscernible] prepare to talk about at the moment. \nEric Mendelson: And Mike, this is Eric. Just also to add some color, you know, picking up on, you know, what I answered in one of the questions earlier, we could have generated higher operating margins, but we felt it was really important to take care of our people. And, you know, I think a lot of other companies are very, you know, sort of aggressive with their people. You know, other people say, other companies say their people are the most important, but then they don't act that way. And we\u2019ve really tried to act that way and as a result, the margin had taken a hit and we have been fully prepared, you know, recognizing that we've got to invest in our people and that's not to say that our team members haven't, you know, shared in the sacrifice because they had tremendously. But we've done everything we possibly could to, you know, hang on to them and to have them sacrifice less than other organizations and we think that HEICO will be rewarded, you know, with their loyalty and dedication coming out of the crisis. So, you know, we're very cognizant of the margins and, you know, and why we think that we can get them to increase moving forward.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it, helpful. And then, just one last one, on performance comp into next year, is that \u2013 I mean, any color around \u2013 should we think of that as being a slight headwind just given, you know, what took place in 2020? Or kind of a net neutral to margins? Or, you know, just how do we think about the mechanics there?\nEric Mendelson: You know, I let Carlos explain on the specifics. But in general, incentive comp is based on performance. So first, the performance has to be there then the incentive comp will kick in. But Carlos can then explain the details.\nCarlos Macau: Oh! Well, I couldn't have said it any better, Eric. I mean, I think the \u2013 as the operations improve and our profitability goes up, there will be incentive comp that's commensurate with that growth. But I don't expect it to be at 2019 levels next year. But I do hopefully knock on wood, as things progress into 2021 and our profits increase, I would expect a performance-based comp to increase also. But, you know, if you're modeling and thinking about on the number side, whatever your estimates are for growth and profitability, we're going to have some growth in our performance comp that's commensurate with that move.\nEric Mendelson: Yes.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. All right, very good. Thanks, guys. \nEric Mendelson : Thanks, Mike. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your questions.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. \nLaurans Mendelson : Good morning, [indiscernible]. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, just staying on that FSG margin, actually, the sequential incremental, so, you know, just the drop there of the EBIT on the higher revenues sequentially using the adjusted number is 22% and you've talked about the 30% decremental and then a higher than 30% incremental on the way back up. Recognizing everything you just said on the different cost components, but you've taken out some cost and, you know, maybe you'll have costs coming back like you just said on a \u2013 when you have good incrementals. Should I care about that number at all? Or is it just kind of irrelevant because its one quarter and everything is still sort of funky?\nCarlos Macau: No, I would \u2013 and this is Carlos, I would say that in the quarter \u2013 we had some headwinds in Q3 and four relative on the margin side to inventory reserves, which I don\u2019t think will repeat itself going forward. So that had a bit of a drag on our incrementals. So, I think you've probably captured it correctly. I wouldn't focus so much on just one quarter. But I do think the incrementals will be better on a go-forward basis than are decrementals then going down.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's the inventory obsolescence expense that's in the gross margin separate from the bad debt expense that's in the segment margin?\nCarlos Macau: That\u2019s correct.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you quantify how much of that's been in excess of normal over the last two quarters?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, I think in the last \u2013 in the last couple quarters, we've probably had evenly between two quarters about $14 million worth of incremental increases in our inventory reserves. And most of that, no, it has been a result of us recognizing that many airlines over the last six months have come out [indiscernible] and discussed some of their fleet reduction plans and retirement of certain types of planes. And so, what we did rather than try and fool ourselves and keep that product [indiscernible] on the shelves, we took a very conservative approach, and said, if the airline is going to put down, let's say, an A300, then we probably need to reserve for some of that inventory might have sitting around to support that portion of the fleet. So, we didn't take those charges [indiscernible] we\u2019ve got that kind of out of our way now and that would be one aspect, if you will, of the margin that I don't anticipate repeating going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry, that's $14 million in both 3Q and 4Q individually, above and beyond\u2026\nCarlos Macau: [Indiscernible] quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: $7 million a quarter, $7 million a quarter.\nCarlos Macau : $14 million totally, you know, in the back half of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. I mean, even $7 million a quarter would take \u2013 you know, if I adjust it for the bad debt, then I adjust it for that, it would put your margins more in the mid-teens in the back half of 2020 already. And then, should I be working in back half of 2021 a better than 30% incremental off of that?\nCarlos Macau: At this point, no, I don't know that I would go that high. As we get into 2021, I'm happy to help you with that math, but I don\u2019t know that I would guide you to that right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Last quarter, you said incremental is better than 30, was that\u2026\nCarlos Macau: Last quarter I said our incremental should rise faster than our decrements.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right.\nCarlos Macau: It went down, but I don't think I gave any numbers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nCarlos Macau: Because we really don\u2019t know. These incremental are dependent on mix, which part of each segment rose faster, so it's \u2013 you know, it's not like HEICO has one product, and it's very easy to just do the math. We've got such a diverse product base, which [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure.\nCarlos Macau: It does make it a little more difficult to pinpoint, you know, without guidance out there where that \u2013 you know, what does incrementals are going to look like.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate that. I guess I'm just trying to get at whatever the incrementals are going to be or whatever you sort of think of the incremental as being in a framework, right, it's a company with a 30% incremental, it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter. That calculation can get wonky. Was that a statement working off of the lower margins knowing that the lower margins had the inventory obsolescence? Or is that \u2013 or was that a statement last quarter that's just sort of the broad long-term framework of a company's incremental decremental?\nCarlos Macau: It's a broader long-term framework. I don't think we were looking at any specific quarterly adjustments and making that statement. I do think it's more of a broader long-term view.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. The company has always maintained, as you've alluded to, a reasonably conservative balance sheet, degree of leverage, you know, relative to the consistency of the margins and cash flows. You've just been handed what will be hard to, you know, knock on wood, harder to ever repeat in terms of severity of downturn, yet, you didn't have a negative cash flow quarter? Does that have you rethinking the optimal balance sheet leverage going forward to continue to do deals and enhance the equity returns?\nCarlos Macau: You wanted to?\nLaurans Mendelson: Yes.\nCarlos Macau: Go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: This is Larry [indiscernible]. What we do is we model in a controlled growth pattern and that's our strategy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right.\nLaurans Mendelson: So, we have said publicly that we aim for a bottom line growth of 15% to 20% annually and that's accurate. And we think in the relative near future, we can continue that growth. I mean, historically, over 31 years, we've done 19%. So in order to accomplish that growth, the controlled growth, we can do it very well using the debt strategy that we have implemented. There is no need for us to go out and do anything greater. Now saying that, people have asked, would you do a transformational transaction, a major acquisition or something else? And the answer is, yes, if it is really going to benefit the bottom line. Too often, we see and we're approached by investment bankers with ideas that we can make HEICO bigger. We can double HEICO or increase it 60%. But they're talking about the topline. And we're focused on increasing the bottom line and cash flow. And so, if the opportunity presented itself to increase the bottom line, we would do that and we would probably take on more debt. The key to taking on the debt is how quickly it would be repaid because we don't want to be up at six or seven times like some other companies. We don't feel comfortable there nor do we need to do that to grow at the 15% to 20% target. And I think, speaking to shareholders, which we do a lot as you know, they like the idea of the steady growth and we do too and we are the [long-view] shareholders. So, it's a strong, steady growth.  When the market collapsed in March, the banks weren't calling on us. We didn't sell debt at a 10% and we slept well every night. So, I guess \u2013 I don't know if that answers your question, but in the\u2026\nUnidentified Analyst: It does. \nLaurans Mendelson: Yes, so that's really the way we look at it. I guess you could say it\u2019s conservative, but \u2013 and in the past, we've been criticized by some people who've said, oh! Why don't you put on more debt and you can do all this stuff? And it's just that is HEICO\u2019s strategy and that's what we're known for, so\u2026\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. I mean, you know, that's really the question is any rethinking of that, so that helps me. And then, last one, related to that controlled growth, is the pace of new product intro, which if I understand correctly, you know, in given periods of time could be faster, but there's a controlled growth element. How would you think through that, Larry or Eric, if there's an opportunity to take market share because the industry has situation presented, but you normally have that controlled growth, you know, how above and beyond will you go with pace of new product intro 2021, 2022 with those sort of competing interests?\nLaurans Mendelson: I think what we will do, we will reach for the sky as long as it will benefit the cash flow and the bottom line and that we see it's going to be strong, real growth. You know, we're not into financial engineering and you can see in the last quarter, we had 177% of reported income was cash. So that's our whole game, if you will. It's the cash flow; it\u2019s the bottom line. And anything we can do [indiscernible] to accomplish that, we are going to do it, for sure. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nEric Mendelson: And having said that, I agree completely. You know, I think that our current level of new product development is a good level. It's a level at which we made sure that we've got, you know, a lot of customers and they're excited about the different products that we're coming out with. So, I really expect that we will continue to stay the course. Now if we see, you know, a significant change in the approval rate at our customers, then, you know, we could revisit it. But I would say, right now, we're very comfortable with what we've got going right now. It was also very encouraging to find out that a lot of our customers were working on improving the use of our parts from their homes. And they were, you know, continuing to focus in this area because it continues to be a major cost driver for the airlines. The airlines know very clearly that if HEICO doesn't exist, their prices go way up. And where we're a, you know, significant part of their strategy. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much. \nEric Mendelson : Thanks [Noah]. \nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you [Noah]. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. You may now ask your question. \nColin Ducharme: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. First question, really in the theme of just visibility maybe best for Victor, and then for Carlos. Victor, you've given us some good comments on where you're seeing opportunity, particularly outside of the commercial aero realm within ETG. I'm just trying to kind of roll up some of the detail that you offered, if you could help us just characterize, you know, within ETG, apart from commercial \u2013 from the, you know, portion of that segment that does have commercial aero leverage, can you characterize the visibility you today see and compare it perhaps where that visibility for that portion of the business was pre-pandemic, just trying to kind of understand, you know, your confidence there? And then, linking that to the overall business, maybe best for Carlos would be, you know, still with suspended guidance, can you help us think through what framework or pre-conditions you need to see before you get incremental confidence to re-establish that guidance? And then, I had a follow up for Larry next. \nVictor Mendelson : So, Colin hi, this is Victor. It's a good question. It's an interesting mix what's going on now. Visibility is certainly less than it was pre-pandemic and what we're seeing though and what we found in the businesses that are serving the high-end electronics market, things that I would consider more connected to the general economy, the broader economy, that of late, there has been \u2013 over the past few months, a marked increase in demands, a marked increase in orders, a marked increase in inquiries, coding activity and things of that sort. And the level of activity is markedly better than it was earlier in the year. And so, that leads me to be generally optimistic. It seems that people are asking to pull in orders. They're asking for faster deliveries. They're more concerned with that than they were. In the very early days of the pandemic, we had an interesting phenomenon where customers were actually looking to accelerate orders because they were worried about the supply chain and things getting delayed. There were stories, of course, of product not making it from the Far East, particularly China, where the virus originated. And so, they were worried about that. And so, there was an acceleration. And then all of a sudden, that stopped, and it flipped around and it was going the other way for a while. And now that's reverted.  And so that seems to be very positive and the visibility question is, well, how does that hold up? How long does that hold up? How does that work? Where does it stabilize and so on? One of the key things I think about is we're about to \u2013 within a few months, we'll anniversary out of the start of the pandemic. And so, everything will feel much more positive and be much more positive as a result of that.  By the way, on commercial aviation, the 10% or so of ETG that is usually commercial aviation, you know, that's been improving as well. We've seen some nice signs and improvement there and the future order outlook. I think as the year wears on, that will do better. Also, on the medical side, I think that offers us some upside potential because things had slowed down there. If you recall, there was a \u2013 there were fewer medical procedures and people just not going to the doctor, et cetera during the pandemic, I think that will start to switch around. So that impacted some of our businesses and the components that we sell. The question is one of timing. So that's why I say it's less visibility as a rule of thumb. So, generally speaking, I believe it turns in the right way and it is turning in the right way. The question is when and exactly how keeping in mind, you know, we're already halfway through, a little more actually halfway through than halfway through our first fiscal quarter. So, [indiscernible] a little bit different than most people\u2019s [year-end] as that starts to filter through it. It can \u2013 you know, it becomes a question of does that push through in the third quarter, odes it push through in the fourth, or does it wind up being at the end of 2020? But our fiscal, excuse me at the end of 2021, but our fiscal 2022 and we'll just have to see how that falls out. Was that helpful?\nColin Ducharme: Yes, thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: You're welcome. \nCarlos Macau: I would just add this, once we see the cadence of orders from the airlines being a little bit more stable, if you would, and the flights and the number of aircraft in the air are a little more predictable and more flying that would probably give us the confidence if there is an organization to reinstate our guidance and think a little bit more, you know, broadly about doing that. But right now, there is so much \u2013 you know [indiscernible] of our customers are acting so differently as far as how they spend or maintaining their fleet that is \u2013 you know it\u2019s just not in our best interest to try and thank them at this moment. But I do anticipate during fiscal 2021 that that fog, if you would, will lift and people will have a little bit of visibility as the year progresses. So \u2013 and that point we'll discuss and as the management team reinstating guidance and if we can, we will do so.\nColin Ducharme: Okay, understood. I appreciate that. And then just a couple of follow ups quick one for Eric and then maybe a longer, more thoughtful one for Larry. Eric, I heard you say earlier within FSG PMA, you, I think, characterize competitive conditions as having not changed. Just wanted to link that back to that regulatory announcement, I guess it was now a little over a year ago with CFM and potentially loosening some soil for you guys to plant some seeds there within PMA. I know we've had a pandemic since that announcement that has kind of upended that end-market, but just wanted to verify whether you\u2019ve see any tangible evidence of any competitive movement whether it's, you know, tangible or anecdotal there, that will be great.  And then for Larry, from an M&A standpoint and potential currency used for deals, there's been some conversation on this call of potential for transformational deals much larger and quantum than what you've done in the past. You know, I remember I guess it was 20 some odd years ago, where we created the A shares and that was, you know, in anticipation of, at the time, what could have been a transformational deal. So there is some history with the, you know, willingness to pay stock, but, you know, just wanted to ask you, you know, has the currency been a sticking point to get folks, you know, kind of over the hump? You know, I've always thought that that 80:20 you know, equity share ownership with the put calls that you typically have kind of takes care of that participation and upside for sellers. And so, you know, is that structure \u2013 you know, has that been a sticking point?  And then, relatedly, if you were to consider use of stock for a more transformational deal, do the criteria, the financial and accretion criteria change at all? i.e., do you pull your horns in and perhaps become a little more conservative because you're using, you know, stock for a larger purchase because since you've been such good stewards of the, you know, stock over the longer haul, perhaps you\u2019d have a little more caution when doing \u2013 you know, thinking of a move like that? Thank you very much.\nLaurans Mendelson: So that's a great question and the way you structure it is really shows your understanding of HEICO and you go all the way back to the 1999 and the transaction that we were considering most people have forgotten about that and how the A stock came into being, but you have a great long history and a good memory.  So to answer your question, we will make any accretive acquisition using any medium of exchange that we can. We'll use [indiscernible]; we\u2019ll use [gold bullion]; we'll use stock; we'll use cash; we'll use bonds; we'll use notes, as long as it meets the criteria that we have set forth, which I think I've explained and that is cash flow bottom line. Now, keep in mind, the difficulty in which we operate. Most industrial companies or even aerospace companies operated margins which are 50% or less than our margin. The trick and the reason we use strong margins is because strong margins generate strong cash flow. It's not rocket science [is very good]. Number two, this management is really compensated because of our stock ownership, just like every shareholder out there. And we are completely aligned with every shareholder, every [indiscernible]. If we selfishly make a good acquisition or we generate cash and it goes to the bottom line, the stock price goes up, yes, we benefit because we're the largest group of shareholders. However, every shareholder benefits [indiscernible] with what we have. In other companies, many companies, I believe that the motivation is bifurcated. The management generally owns little equity, and therefore, the management wants to grow the company because the topline, even if the operating margins are 8% or 10%, the topline can double. That requires the use of a lot of cash, it sucks up cash. But the management who is generally there for three to seven years sees his or her compensation double it. They grow the topline from $2 billion to $5 billion, the compensation, the managers compensation goes from $3 million to $6 \u2013 whatever the number is. In our case, we own a large number of shares. So, if the stock goes up 10 points and I'll define it for you, it's public, if we own $12 million or $14 million, and I don't know the exact number, but if you include the 401(k) because we're very concerned about the success and the financial stability of our people, our team members, if that goes up 10 points, we make $140 million or $200 million in equity value. Now, do I care if my salary goes up $3 million? Of course, not.  So, to answer your question, we will make transactions that generate cash flow accretion and stock value. And however \u2013 again, whatever currency we must use, we will do it. I can tell you as an example, we're negotiating, we're talking to somebody now and they came to us and they said, we only want to sell for stock. And I said, well, normally, you know, we'd prefer to give cash. We normally give cash, but for you, because we want this acquisition, whatever you want, we\u2019ll give. You want cash; you want stock, whatever you want, we will give you. So, I don't \u2013 does that kind of answer your question?\nColin Ducharme: I have to work [indiscernible] my models, but thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: We're not sure about Bitcoins. In fact, I got to ask Carlos, if we can use Bitcoin.\nCarlos Macau: Like you said, we use whatever we have to.\nLaurans Mendelson: Whatever we have to do, we'll use.\nColin Ducharme: Hello?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto with UBS. You may now ask your question.\nLouis Raffetto: Hey, good morning, guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLouis Raffetto: I was hoping you mentioned Bitcoin. I was the one missing thing in there, but [indiscernible] is interesting as well. Victor, I just want to go back to you, just make sure I have this for the fourth quarter. What was the organic growth for ETG? Was it flat, down a little, up a little? And then, you know, either you or Carlos, can you help us baseline what the acquired sales will look like, you know, based on deals so far into 2021?\nVictor Mendelson: It was \u2013 Louis, it was flat ETG. This is Victor. It was flat, organic growth in the fourth quarter.\nCarlos Macau: That's correct. That's correct. Louis, roughly, in the fourth quarter, we probably had in ETG around $16 million worth of acquired sales in the numbers. So that will\u2026\nLouis Raffetto : Okay.\nCarlos Macau : You know that will \u2013 we have no reason to think that that won't continue going forward and most of the acquisitions, you know, occurred in August and Q4, so we got the benefit of most of that. And, of course, that\u2019s probably a decent run rate, I would guess.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay, that's perfect. And Eric, just one for you, one to follow-up. I know you've mentioned before that between parts and MRO is kind of same ballpark. But if I go back to last quarter, it was kind of down 40 in parts down 60 in MRO, so, you know, business down 40%. So, are we looking for \u2013 was there a kind of an improvement in MRL and parts was flattish? Or any additional color you can give there?\nEric Mendelson: So, let me take a look at some of my numbers here. I mean, it was all really in the same \u2013 as I said, the same ballpark there. So, I wouldn't say that there was much of a difference. You know, in any one quarter, one can be, you know, based on the prior comp, one can be ahead, you know, versus the other. You know, if you look at 2019, in the fourth quarter, we had 12% organic growth in Flight Support and on against the comp in 2018, 13% growth. So it's 25% growth over, you know, two annual quarters there. So things can move around, you know, based on this.  You know, in general, I would say that the parts and \u2013 the parts business would be down less than the component repair. The way that that normally works is in component repair, you can end up having some in the pipeline, which has been approved by the customers. So there can be a little bit of a lag there. And as a result, it could lag where the component repair comes back a little after the parts come back because first they have to procure the parts in order to be able to do the component repair. But I would say that it was all, you know, in a similar ballpark. Component repair was down more than parts, but I wouldn't get too wrapped around that because it can vary a little bit, as I said, quarter-by-quarter.\nLouis Raffetto: I know, that's perfect. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: You're welcome. It\u2019s similar to Q3, I'd say.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow up question from Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. You may now ask your question.\nColin Ducharme: Yes. Sorry for the follow up. Eric, I did just want to get a color on that comment with the European regulatory action a little over a year ago linking to your comments FSG PMA, that competitive conditions hadn't changed. Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Colin. I'm glad you asked that because we went on to the next question before we had an opportunity to answer on that. Yes, we \u2013 I would say that we're \u2013 we continue to be encouraged based upon the conversations that we've heard. You know, we don't like to speak about, you know, particular product lines or customers, but we do believe that there's been good progress in that area. It has sent a very clear message regarding engine, you know, alternative parts for engines, whether it's PMA or DER repair. So again, I think that it \u2013 there have been, you know, nice conversations and some good \u2013 you know, good results coming out of that enforcement action. \nColin Ducharme: Thanks. \nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Presenters, there are no further questions on queue, you many continue.\nLaurans Mendelson: If there are no further questions, I want to thank everybody on this call for participating and for their interest in HEICO. As you know, we remain available to you by phone. If you have any other further questions or information that you'd like, you can call Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself, we\u2019ll be happy to respond. And I want to wish you all a very happy, healthy holiday season. Hopefully, when we next speak, which will be the report of our Q1 sometime in late February, most of you will have received your COVID vaccine. And we'll be on the way to continued good health. So Happy Holidays to everyone. And again, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters.

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Hey, Peter, this is Carlos. So, the additional bad debt wasn't that significant in the quarter, maybe [$1.5 million] something like that. Remember, we took about $7.5 million in Q3 to deal with some bankruptcies and in Q4, it was kind of the normal noise. So, you'd have to add about, I guess, [9 million] back to the annual margin to see what that would be. I think that performance-based comp is going to [flux] with sales, Peter. So, I'm not anticipating getting back to 2019 performance-based comp levels in 2021. But they will [flux] with our sales and profitability. So as things pick up there in 2021, we'll probably see some increase in the bonus, and performance based comp expenses, but it will be commensurate with our profitability growth. Good morning, Gautam. Thanks, Ken. How are you doing Michael? For the year, organic growth in ETG was roughly flattish to down a percent and that was principally driven by aerospace. Remember that roughly 10% or so of the segment is commercial aerospace and it's going to follow the same trend as our FSG segment, so that was down. Other businesses did above what we expect them to do this year, absent logistical challenges of COVID and some of the disruptions that Victor mentioned earlier. So, I share Victor's optimism for next year. I think that the businesses can grow. I think that the commercial aerospace portion of ETG will mimic the recovery patterns in the FSG and that will be a bit of an anchor, probably in the early part of the year and then pick up towards the end of 2021. I think \u2013 Michael this is Carlos. I think you're on the right path. So, as Eric mentioned earlier, we are thinking about next year in terms of a bit of a continuation of what we saw in Q4 into the early part of 2021 with a gradual progression upwards towards the back end of 2021. And I think during that back-end period, you'll see our margins improve and I think in the early part of the year, you should see them slightly improve. So, I \u2013 could we get to the low teens? Yes. I mean, I think that's definitely in the cards for us, and obviously, we hope to do better. But, you know, when we have more visibility, Michael, on next year, we'll \u2013 you know, I'm hopeful we could restore guidance at some point. But when we do at that point, I'll give you all the details you need. But right now, what I've told you is about all I can [indiscernible] prepare to talk about at the moment. Oh! Well, I couldn't have said it any better, Eric. I mean, I think the \u2013 as the operations improve and our profitability goes up, there will be incentive comp that's commensurate with that growth. But I don't expect it to be at 2019 levels next year. But I do hopefully knock on wood, as things progress into 2021 and our profits increase, I would expect a performance-based comp to increase also. But, you know, if you're modeling and thinking about on the number side, whatever your estimates are for growth and profitability, we're going to have some growth in our performance comp that's commensurate with that move. No, I would \u2013 and this is Carlos, I would say that in the quarter \u2013 we had some headwinds in Q3 and four relative on the margin side to inventory reserves, which I don't think will repeat itself going forward. So that had a bit of a drag on our incrementals. So, I think you've probably captured it correctly. I wouldn't focus so much on just one quarter. But I do think the incrementals will be better on a go-forward basis than are decrementals then going down. That's correct. Yes, I think in the last \u2013 in the last couple quarters, we've probably had evenly between two quarters about $14 million worth of incremental increases in our inventory reserves. And most of that, no, it has been a result of us recognizing that many airlines over the last six months have come out [indiscernible] and discussed some of their fleet reduction plans and retirement of certain types of planes. And so, what we did rather than try and fool ourselves and keep that product [indiscernible] on the shelves, we took a very conservative approach, and said, if the airline is going to put down, let's say, an A300, then we probably need to reserve for some of that inventory might have sitting around to support that portion of the fleet. So, we didn't take those charges [indiscernible] we've got that kind of out of our way now and that would be one aspect, if you will, of the margin that I don't anticipate repeating going forward. [Indiscernible] quarter. $14 million totally, you know, in the back half of the year. At this point, no, I don't know that I would go that high. As we get into 2021, I'm happy to help you with that math, but I don't know that I would guide you to that right now. Last quarter I said our incremental should rise faster than our decrements. It went down, but I don't think I gave any numbers. Because we really don't know. These incremental are dependent on mix, which part of each segment rose faster, so it's \u2013 you know, it's not like HEICO has one product, and it's very easy to just do the math. We've got such a diverse product base, which [indiscernible]. It does make it a little more difficult to pinpoint, you know, without guidance out there where that \u2013 you know, what does incrementals are going to look like. It's a broader long-term framework. I don't think we were looking at any specific quarterly adjustments and making that statement. I do think it's more of a broader long-term view. You wanted to? Go ahead. I would just add this, once we see the cadence of orders from the airlines being a little bit more stable, if you would, and the flights and the number of aircraft in the air are a little more predictable and more flying that would probably give us the confidence if there is an organization to reinstate our guidance and think a little bit more, you know, broadly about doing that. But right now, there is so much \u2013 you know [indiscernible] of our customers are acting so differently as far as how they spend or maintaining their fleet that is \u2013 you know it's just not in our best interest to try and thank them at this moment. But I do anticipate during fiscal 2021 that that fog, if you would, will lift and people will have a little bit of visibility as the year progresses. So \u2013 and that point we'll discuss and as the management team reinstating guidance and if we can, we will do so. Like you said, we use whatever we have to. That's correct. That's correct. Louis, roughly, in the fourth quarter, we probably had in ETG around $16 million worth of acquired sales in the numbers. So that will... You know that will \u2013 we have no reason to think that that won't continue going forward and most of the acquisitions, you know, occurred in August and Q4, so we got the benefit of most of that. And, of course, that's probably a decent run rate, I would guess."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 5% to a record $875 million in fiscal 2020, up from $834.5 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in fiscal 2020 is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 1%. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower sales of commercial aerospace and medical products, largely attributable to the pandemic, partially offset by increased sales of defense and space products.  The ETG's net sales increased 8% to a record $236.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $219.5 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 acquisitions, and the anticipated increase in commercial space revenues. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 5% to a record $258.8 million in fiscal 2020, up from $245.7 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, lower performance-based compensation expense, and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales and less favorable product mix of certain commercial aerospace and medical products, partially offset by increased net sales of certain defense products. The ETG's operating income increased 14% to a record $73.9 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, up from $64.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects a more favorable product mix and increased net sales of certain space and defense products, partially offset by a decrease in net sales of certain commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 29.6% in fiscal 2020, up from 29.4% in fiscal 2019. The ETG's operating margin improved to 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 29.4% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly reflects efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth and the improved gross profit margin. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Greg, this is Victor. I'm not sure I'm following the question, the trajectory for margins...? Yes. I mean, I don't think of it very much in terms of performance-based compensation so much as the mix and the business is doing well, first, on their own independently and good margin performance at the operating level, the individual businesses. And if you look in the mix, as we had told you earlier in the year, we expected that our space revenues, commercial space revenues would be healthy, which they were, would be strong, which they were, that's a decent margin. Some of those operations are good margin operations for us, so I wouldn't say this was a surprise to us. And keep in mind, Greg that our margins \u2013 I mean we guide to this frequently in the ETG, our margins fluctuate over the course of the year. That is a typical year for us. This is nothing unusual for us and I would anticipate that's \u2013 the past is prelude and we don't really do anything to try to manage the margins or manage the earnings into a particular quarter or period. We really manage to maximize profitability, so this is a reflection of that. You're welcome. Yes, I mean, with disruptions \u2013 this is Victor by the way. And good morning. Look, that is continuing, that kind of thing and it just \u2013 it sort of \u2013 I would say it ebbs and flows a little bit. I would expect that with the pandemic's numbers, that COVID cases numbers rising, we may see more of that in a few months ahead, I don't know. But it comes through, you know, it's in supply chain; it can be on the customer side, where the customer doesn't show up to do an acceptance and test procedure or their transportation doesn't show up and can be a week or two late. It's nothing that fundamentally shifts the business and then eventually catches up and it seems to come and go with this pandemic. I through much of the fourth quarter, started to reappear again as the pandemic numbers began to increase later in October and, you know, I would expect that to be the case until this thing gets under control. And so, I'm optimistic that as it gets more under control with the vaccine, we'll see less of it. Yes its \u2013 and it's a good question. Of course, keeping in mind that defense is about usually around half of the ETG's business that can fluctuate up and down a bit, but it's somewhere in that ballpark. And then, you've got the other markets that we serve, which are, of course, significant, which is a little different than the large defense primes, which are much more heavily defense, although you do see some commercial space in the defense primes as well in their numbers.  So, I think it's difficult to find a one-to-one correlation between the defense primes and our ETG businesses. And really what we do is we look down and we drill down into the individual businesses. We have and in turn the individual programs that they're on and the products that they're on. And to be honest with you, we don't always know. As you're aware, the products we make are respond to a specification, to a customer need, a specific customer need as opposed to their design or blueprint, let's say. And so, they'll tell us, as an example, they need something that does a very specific function and performs in a very specific area and we'll produce that and they may not tell us what is going on. Very often when we figure it out, we usually can figure it out, but they may not share with us exactly what it's going on. So, that's why there's not a one-to-one correlation to it.  As a rule of thumb, as we've said before, we don't think defense budgets grow to the sky, and that at some point, we see, you know, defense, as a rule of thumb, flatter than it was over the past, let's say, four years or so. And we'll just have to see how that all plays out. Let me add one thing, we have a few 100 people on the line right now. So, let me give everybody on the line an open invitation, if they have a wonderful acquisition for us to make, if they want cash, if they want stock, whatever the [notes], whatever you want, if you've got a great company and you want a wonderful home, give us a call, and we're going to talk to you. So, you know, we'll use whatever medium of exchange is necessary to make a great acquisition. Right. It can be. We have \u2013 in the past, we've looked at some very large transactions, and we've been priced out of the market. Some of them were good; some of them were, you know, not so good, and \u2013 but we don't pay 14 or 12 times EBITDA, it's just \u2013 you know, that's not in our strategy. So, you know, and quite a bit, we've been able to grow compounded. The bottom line is 19% and stock price is [24]. So, we have a model which is somewhat unique and I think Eric described the very aptly. We really believe in the culture of HEICO.  What the analysts can't relate in their reports is the quality of the management. I must say that \u2013 and I'm not talking about myself or even Eric, or Victor, but the people who are team members of HEICO, in my opinion, are truly extraordinary individuals. They're entrepreneurial; they're smart; they watch every dollar; they work 24/7. And this is an asset that doesn't appear on the balance sheet and I think the great strength of HEICO lies in its very, very capable array of team members. And again, if any of them are on the phone, I want to thank them personally, but I do want the investing public to understand that this is a great, great asset that doesn't appear in a 10-K or Q or analyst reports. But to me, it's the culture that drives the bottom line and the success of HEICO. Sure, Ken. You know, and by the way, I don't want to overstate space, it's been good for us this year. I think it's looking promising going into next year, but I don't want to overstate it to lead you to believe that it's going to be stratospheric, no pun intended. But, it is moving in the right direction for us and we have some good opportunities and we are pursuing them. And when I refer to space, by the way, we're referring two commercial space, in fact, and defense space is encompassed within the defense number that we report, so we don't actually break it out separately and that's why you hear us refer to that. And I would expect that the opportunities for us in the space markets are more in what I would consider some of the larger satellite markets or satellite opportunities, some of the constellations, actually, but some of the larger constellations, and less in the very new space, very, very small set market, I don't think that's going to be the big market for us. But there certainly is an increased interest in both satellite opportunities as well as Earth observation and space exploration that's benefited us and I think it will continue to benefit us. That doesn't mean, by the way, that we won't have periods where space \u2013 you know, we won't have quarters where space is lower for us. It is still a somewhat volatile realm, but overall, we like it and think it's moving in the right direction. Thank you. Let me take it in reverse order there. I think we can have organic growth in 2021, but it's early in the year, there are a lot of things that will dictate what happens there and which is why we didn't issue guidance on the year. But I \u2013 our companies are certainly working toward that and I would \u2013 I have optimism that we can accomplish that at this point, but I want to let the year get further in. But right now, I would be surprised if we don't get organic growth in fiscal 2021, but let's see how the year wears on and what happens. And in terms of 2020, Carlos, yes [indiscernible]. So, Colin hi, this is Victor. It's a good question. It's an interesting mix what's going on now. Visibility is certainly less than it was pre-pandemic and what we're seeing though and what we found in the businesses that are serving the high-end electronics market, things that I would consider more connected to the general economy, the broader economy, that of late, there has been \u2013 over the past few months, a marked increase in demands, a marked increase in orders, a marked increase in inquiries, coding activity and things of that sort. And the level of activity is markedly better than it was earlier in the year. And so, that leads me to be generally optimistic. It seems that people are asking to pull in orders. They're asking for faster deliveries. They're more concerned with that than they were. In the very early days of the pandemic, we had an interesting phenomenon where customers were actually looking to accelerate orders because they were worried about the supply chain and things getting delayed. There were stories, of course, of product not making it from the Far East, particularly China, where the virus originated. And so, they were worried about that. And so, there was an acceleration. And then all of a sudden, that stopped, and it flipped around and it was going the other way for a while. And now that's reverted.  And so that seems to be very positive and the visibility question is, well, how does that hold up? How long does that hold up? How does that work? Where does it stabilize and so on? One of the key things I think about is we're about to \u2013 within a few months, we'll anniversary out of the start of the pandemic. And so, everything will feel much more positive and be much more positive as a result of that.  By the way, on commercial aviation, the 10% or so of ETG that is usually commercial aviation, you know, that's been improving as well. We've seen some nice signs and improvement there and the future order outlook. I think as the year wears on, that will do better. Also, on the medical side, I think that offers us some upside potential because things had slowed down there. If you recall, there was a \u2013 there were fewer medical procedures and people just not going to the doctor, et cetera during the pandemic, I think that will start to switch around. So that impacted some of our businesses and the components that we sell. The question is one of timing. So that's why I say it's less visibility as a rule of thumb. So, generally speaking, I believe it turns in the right way and it is turning in the right way. The question is when and exactly how keeping in mind, you know, we're already halfway through, a little more actually halfway through than halfway through our first fiscal quarter. So, [indiscernible] a little bit different than most people's [year-end] as that starts to filter through it. It can \u2013 you know, it becomes a question of does that push through in the third quarter, odes it push through in the fourth, or does it wind up being at the end of 2020? But our fiscal, excuse me at the end of 2021, but our fiscal 2022 and we'll just have to see how that falls out. Was that helpful? You're welcome. It was \u2013 Louis, it was flat ETG. This is Victor. It was flat, organic growth in the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO fourth quarter and full fiscal 2020 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Erich Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macao, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now before reviewing our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the impact on HEICO's operating results from the COVID-19 global pandemic. The results of operations in fiscal 2020 were significantly affected by COVID-19 global pandemic. The effects of the pandemic, and related actions by governments around the world, to mitigate its spread has impacted our employees, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers. Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, we have implemented health and safety measures at our facilities in accordance with the CDC guidelines to protect team members and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Most of our facilities are considered essential businesses and have remained operational during the pandemic. We are thankful for the outstanding commitment of our team members towards our customers, shareholders, and each other during these very challenging times. The board of directors and management of HEICO are truly humbled by the dedication of our team members to their company during these unprecedented times. Currently, we believe the recent vaccine progress will most notably result in a gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services, commencing in fiscal 2021. As demand for air travel slowly recovers, we remained very confident in our ability to offer cost saving solutions and robust product development programs that we expect to increase our market share and allow us to have even a stronger presence within the commercial aviation market. I'd like to take a few moments to summarize the highlights of our full fiscal 2020 and fourth quarter results. Despite the many challenges faced in fiscal 2020, HEICO has continued to generate excellent cash flow. Our cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong at $409 million and $437.4 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $110.2 million or 177% of reported net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $124 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As all of you know, HEICO's most important metric is cash flow. And I think that the results of 2020 operations, particularly the fourth quarter, are clearly indicative of the success. We are encouraged by the sequential improvements in our fiscal 2020 consolidated fourth quarter operating results over the third quarter of fiscal 2020. And during the fourth quarter, we experienced increases in consolidated operating income, net income, and net sales of 30%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. In fact, despite the continued impact of the pandemic on demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services, the Flight Support Group's operating income, and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 improved sequentially, by 78% and 9% respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, a significant improvement. The Electronic Technologies Group and from now on, I'll call it ETG, set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, improving 8% and 14% respectively, over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases principally reflect the excellent operating performance of our fiscal 2020 acquisitions, as well as continued disciplined cost management on the part of our operating teams. We recently entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit agreement by one year to November 23, and to increase the committed capital to $1.5 billion. In addition, our credit facility continues to include a feature that will allow the company to increase the capacity by 350 million or become a $1.85 billion facility through increased commitments from existing vendors or the addition of new lenders and can be extended for an additional one-year period.  We are very thankful for the continued support of our existing Bank Group. Their loyalty to HEICO is demonstrated by this credit facility amendment further offers us the financial flexibility to pursue our disciplined strategy of acquiring high quality businesses at fair prices. Our net debt, which we define as total debt, less cash, and cash equivalents of $333 million, compared to shareholders equity ratio improved to 16.6% as of October 31, 2020, and this was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.71 times as of October 31, 2020, down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. Keep in mind this is after making six acquisitions during the year. During fiscal 2020, we successfully completed six acquisitions, four of which were completed since the pandemic start. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2024. And we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes and accelerate growth to maximize shareholder returns. As we reported yesterday, we declared an $0.08 per share regular semi-annual cash dividend on both classes of common stock payable January 21, 2021 to shareholders of record as of January 7, 2021. This cash dividend will be our 85th consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. HEICO's strength in the phase of challenging business conditions, coupled with our optimism of the future, gave our Board of Directors the confidence to continue paying our normal cash dividend. While this is very important to all of our shareholders, it is especially important to our team members, the vast majority of whom are fellow HEICO shareholders through the personal holdings in their 401(k) plan. Let's talk about some of the new fourth quarter acquisitions. As I discussed during the third quarter teleconference, we completed three acquisitions in August through our ETG Group. First, we acquired a 75% of the equity interest in transformational security and intelligent devices. These two companies design and develop and manufacture, state of the art technical surveillance countermeasures equipment. Next, we acquired approximately 90% of the equity interest of Connect Tech. Connect Tech designs and manufactures rugged, small form factor embedded computing solutions used in rugged commercial and industrial, aerospace and defense, transportation and smart energy applications. These acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 4% to $2.29 in fiscal 2020, as compared to $2.39 in fiscal 2019. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 27% to $0.45 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Those decreases principally reflect the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support, partially offset by lower income tax expense, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest, as well as lower interest expense. Depreciation amortization expense totaled 88.6 million in fiscal 2020, up from 83.5 million in fiscal 2019, and totaled 23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 21.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in the fiscal year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflect the incremental impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions.  Research and development, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. R&D expense was 65.6 million in fiscal 2020, or about 3.7% of net sales, and that compared to 66.6 million in fiscal 2019 or 3.2% of net sales. R&D expense was 16.6 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 or 3.9% of net sales, and that compared to 17.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and that was 3.3% of net sales.  SG&A expenses consolidated decreased by 14% to 305.5 million in fiscal 2020 and that was down from 356.7 in fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in fiscal 2020 reflects a decrease in performance based compensation expense, a reduction in other G&A expenses, and a reduction in other selling expenses, including outside sales commissions, marketing and travel. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, as well as the previously mentioned increase in bad debt expense, and that was due to collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2020 as a result of the financial impact of the pandemic. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 18% to 72.6 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, down from 88.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&AA expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects a reduction in other general and administrative expense, decrease in performance based compensation expense, and the reduction in other selling expenses including outside sales commission marketing and travel. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, as well as the increase in bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales dropped to 17.1% in fiscal 2020 and that was down slightly from 17.4% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2020 again is due to lower performance based compensation expense and a decrease in other selling expenses, partially offset by the impact of higher other G&A expense as a percentage of net sales and an increase in bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 17% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, and that was up slightly from 16.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects higher other general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales due to the decreased sales volume and the aforementioned increase in debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in lower performance based compensation expense and a decrease in other selling expenses. Interest expense decreased to 13.2 million in fiscal 2020, and that was down significantly from 21.7 million in fiscal 2019, and a decreased to 2.5 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2020, down from 5.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Decreases were principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 was 7.9%, as compared to 17.8% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2020 is mainly attributable to a larger tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2020 from stock option exercises, compared to fiscal 2019 and that resulted from more stock options being exercised, as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option-ease holding period. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was 22.3%, and that compared to 19.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 21.9 million in fiscal 2020, and that compared to 31.8 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in fiscal 2020, principally reflects a decrease in operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support, in which non-controlling interest are [held], as well as the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019, that effectively resulted in the transfer of 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries, and that was transferred back to our Flight Support Group. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. And that compared to 6.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interest are held. For the full-fiscal year 2021 at the present time, we anticipate a combined tax and non-controlling interest rate of approximately 23% to 24%. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, as you will know our financial position and forecasted cash flow remained very strong, previously, I mentioned cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $409.1 million and 437.4 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled 110.2 million or 177% of net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to 124 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in fiscal 2021 and that would be up from the 22.9 million spent in fiscal 2020. Our working capital ratio, which is of course current assets divided by current liabilities improved to 4.8 as of October 31, 2020 as compared to 2.8 as of October 31, 2019. Days sales outstanding, DSOs of accounts receivable improved to 45 days as of October 31, 2020 and that compared favorably to the 47 days as of October 31, 2019. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of sales and our Top 5 customers represented approximately 24% and 20% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate increased to 153 days for the year ended October 31, 2020 as compared to 124 days for the year ended October 31, 2019. That increase in turnover rates principally reflect certain long-term and non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments, which were based on pre-pandemic net sales expectations and also to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now, the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal 2021, the pandemic will likely continue to negatively impact commercial aerospace industry as well as HEICO. Given this uncertainty, HEICO cannot provide fiscal 2021 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we do believe our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, healthy balance sheet, increased liquidity will permit us to invest in new research and development and gain market share as the industry recovers. In addition, our time tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring \u2013 operating high cash generating businesses across a diverse base of industry, besides commercial aerospace and these industries are defense, space, and other high-end markets, including electronics and medical, puts us in good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. We are cautiously optimistic that the recent vaccine progress should generate increased commercial air travel, and will result in a gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services commencing in fiscal 2021. I'd like to conclude my remarks by again thanking all of HEICO's talented team members who have worked very hard to exceed our customers' expectations during these difficult times, which were brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their dedication to HEICO's customers and to the safety of their fellow team members has been exemplary. And I want to thank each and every member of HEICO's global team to understand that the Board of Directors and I value your commitment to our collective safety and success during these challenging times. I am confident that our future is bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period as a stronger and more competitive company.  Those are the extent of my prepared remarks, and I would now like to open the floor for questions. Good morning, Peter. Yes, let me just add to that. You know, I think the bottom line to the whole thing is it depends on the deal; it depends on how much we want it; it depends on what the seller is looking for, and so forth. And we would consider giving stock under the right circumstances. As Eric says, we always prefer cash, and the reason we prefer cash is because when we make accretive acquisitions, the value of the whole company goes up. So whatever stock we give, really is \u2013 we've given out too much stock because the stock price goes up. So, it's better for all existing shareholders to \u2013 for us to use cash. But if there is a real [indiscernible] desirable acquisition, we're going to make that acquisition and we're going to do it in the best way we can. So we've definitely would consider cash stock or combination. Thank you. Good morning. You know, that's a very good question. The answer is yes. We are making progress on lessors using HEICO parts. You know, we're very careful that when we go out, we don't promote PMA parts, we promote HEICO parts to the lessors, you know, given HEICO's market cap and technical capabilities, technical history, product success. So, we're very careful to promote HEICO in that way.  And we've had a number of, you know, very good successes. Number one, if airlines negotiate in a request, the right to be able to use HEICO parts or PMA parts, the ER parts upfront in the lease, very often, they're able to get that concession because the airlines know that the vast majority of airlines out there operate using these parts. So they're really \u2013 that is not a reduced marketability on the product, number one.  Number two, there are a number of lessors that are coming out and offering really like power by the hour, thrust by the hour, aircraft by the hour, where they take responsibility for the overhaul and maintenance of that particular product and those lessors are using our parts very aggressively.  So, we see \u2013 you know, so the answer is yes, we've seen progress. However, there is a lot of opportunity out there because there's been a fair number of leases that have been signed in the past were by airlines \u2013 some airlines where, if you will, [indiscernible] into giving away that right and now that certain lessors want to try to extract value in order to \u2013 you know, in order to, frankly make more money. So, the airlines need to be very vigilant in request to this upfront, and then they're able to get that concession. Good morning, Ken. Happy Holidays to you. Good morning. Good morning, [indiscernible]. Yes. This is Larry [indiscernible]. What we do is we model in a controlled growth pattern and that's our strategy. So, we have said publicly that we aim for a bottom line growth of 15% to 20% annually and that's accurate. And we think in the relative near future, we can continue that growth. I mean, historically, over 31 years, we've done 19%. So in order to accomplish that growth, the controlled growth, we can do it very well using the debt strategy that we have implemented. There is no need for us to go out and do anything greater. Now saying that, people have asked, would you do a transformational transaction, a major acquisition or something else? And the answer is, yes, if it is really going to benefit the bottom line. Too often, we see and we're approached by investment bankers with ideas that we can make HEICO bigger. We can double HEICO or increase it 60%. But they're talking about the topline. And we're focused on increasing the bottom line and cash flow. And so, if the opportunity presented itself to increase the bottom line, we would do that and we would probably take on more debt. The key to taking on the debt is how quickly it would be repaid because we don't want to be up at six or seven times like some other companies. We don't feel comfortable there nor do we need to do that to grow at the 15% to 20% target. And I think, speaking to shareholders, which we do a lot as you know, they like the idea of the steady growth and we do too and we are the [long-view] shareholders. So, it's a strong, steady growth.  When the market collapsed in March, the banks weren't calling on us. We didn't sell debt at a 10% and we slept well every night. So, I guess \u2013 I don't know if that answers your question, but in the... Yes, so that's really the way we look at it. I guess you could say it's conservative, but \u2013 and in the past, we've been criticized by some people who've said, oh! Why don't you put on more debt and you can do all this stuff? And it's just that is HEICO's strategy and that's what we're known for, so... I think what we will do, we will reach for the sky as long as it will benefit the cash flow and the bottom line and that we see it's going to be strong, real growth. You know, we're not into financial engineering and you can see in the last quarter, we had 177% of reported income was cash. So that's our whole game, if you will. It's the cash flow; it's the bottom line. And anything we can do [indiscernible] to accomplish that, we are going to do it, for sure. Thank you [Noah]. So that's a great question and the way you structure it is really shows your understanding of HEICO and you go all the way back to the 1999 and the transaction that we were considering most people have forgotten about that and how the A stock came into being, but you have a great long history and a good memory.  So to answer your question, we will make any accretive acquisition using any medium of exchange that we can. We'll use [indiscernible]; we'll use [gold bullion]; we'll use stock; we'll use cash; we'll use bonds; we'll use notes, as long as it meets the criteria that we have set forth, which I think I've explained and that is cash flow bottom line. Now, keep in mind, the difficulty in which we operate. Most industrial companies or even aerospace companies operated margins which are 50% or less than our margin. The trick and the reason we use strong margins is because strong margins generate strong cash flow. It's not rocket science [is very good]. Number two, this management is really compensated because of our stock ownership, just like every shareholder out there. And we are completely aligned with every shareholder, every [indiscernible]. If we selfishly make a good acquisition or we generate cash and it goes to the bottom line, the stock price goes up, yes, we benefit because we're the largest group of shareholders. However, every shareholder benefits [indiscernible] with what we have. In other companies, many companies, I believe that the motivation is bifurcated. The management generally owns little equity, and therefore, the management wants to grow the company because the topline, even if the operating margins are 8% or 10%, the topline can double. That requires the use of a lot of cash, it sucks up cash. But the management who is generally there for three to seven years sees his or her compensation double it. They grow the topline from $2 billion to $5 billion, the compensation, the managers compensation goes from $3 million to $6 \u2013 whatever the number is. In our case, we own a large number of shares. So, if the stock goes up 10 points and I'll define it for you, it's public, if we own $12 million or $14 million, and I don't know the exact number, but if you include the 401(k) because we're very concerned about the success and the financial stability of our people, our team members, if that goes up 10 points, we make $140 million or $200 million in equity value. Now, do I care if my salary goes up $3 million? Of course, not.  So, to answer your question, we will make transactions that generate cash flow accretion and stock value. And however \u2013 again, whatever currency we must use, we will do it. I can tell you as an example, we're negotiating, we're talking to somebody now and they came to us and they said, we only want to sell for stock. And I said, well, normally, you know, we'd prefer to give cash. We normally give cash, but for you, because we want this acquisition, whatever you want, we'll give. You want cash; you want stock, whatever you want, we will give you. So, I don't \u2013 does that kind of answer your question? We're not sure about Bitcoins. In fact, I got to ask Carlos, if we can use Bitcoin. Whatever we have to do, we'll use. Good morning. If there are no further questions, I want to thank everybody on this call for participating and for their interest in HEICO. As you know, we remain available to you by phone. If you have any other further questions or information that you'd like, you can call Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself, we'll be happy to respond. And I want to wish you all a very happy, healthy holiday season. Hopefully, when we next speak, which will be the report of our Q1 sometime in late February, most of you will have received your COVID vaccine. And we'll be on the way to continued good health. So Happy Holidays to everyone. And again, thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $924.8 million in fiscal year 2020, as compared to $1,240.2 million in fiscal year 2019. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $193.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $324.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The net sales decreases are principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines, resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020, due to the pandemic. Net sales in fiscal 2020 follows the 13% and 12% organic growth reported in the year in fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 respectively. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $143.1 million in fiscal 2020, as compared to $242 million in the fiscal year 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $62.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreases principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales, a lower gross profit margin and an increase in bad debt expense due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2020 as a result of the pandemic's financial impact, partially offset by a decrease in performance-based compensation expense. The lower gross profit margin principally reflects an increase in inventory obsolescence expense, mainly resulting from the announced retirement of certain aircraft types in engine platforms by our commercial aerospace customers due to the pandemic's financial impact. Additionally, the lower gross profit margin reflects the impact from lower net sales within our repair and overhaul parts and services and aftermarket replacement parts product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 15.5% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 19.5% in fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to 19.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease that the operating margin decreases principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned, higher bad debt expense in fixed cost efficiencies loss resulting from the pandemic's impact, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Good morning. Yeah, I would say, we're \u2013 well, first of all, good morning, Peter, and thanks for your question. We are, I would say, very encouraged by seeing the pickup. Conversations with our customers remain very strong. They're very interested and excited about our product. We believe that we're going to come out of the pandemic with greater market share. In conversations with our sales VPs, I really question them on the particular products that we're coming out with, as well as why specifically, each one of them felt that we would be growing market share. And, you know, they claim that the conversations with the customers are causing them to understand that HEICO is viewed as a very significant part of the supply chain. We've matured into a nice sized company and there's no reason why they shouldn't be buying a greater number of our products.  So, I think we were correct when we called the bottom in May, expecting that May was going to be the bottom and that things were going to trend up. I can tell you that November was a very good month and things were looking very good. I would say, you know, for the last couple of \u2013 probably the last week or so, things have gotten a little quieter. But that's not necessarily atypical because normally around the holiday season things start to slow down. But I think, given the news that we see with the pandemic, it's sort of logical that the second half of December and January may be a bit quieter. But having said that, the vaccine news, of course was very good. And in looking \u2013 and speaking with our customers about the flight schedules that they're operating in the inventory that they have, you know, as I pointed out in our August call, the flight schedules were really far in excess of the spare parts purchases. And in discussions with a number of airlines, you know, they recognized that they can't continue to operate the schedules that they're operating based on the purchases that they're making.  So, we anticipate an improvement, in particular in the second half of our fiscal year. And obviously, the timing is going to be very dependent on the vaccine news, and, you know, what we see in terms of the infection rates. So, good morning, Scott. So, with regard to the pricing, you know, I think that we're definitely flexible on pricing. I think that a lot of people \u2013 you know, frankly, there's a lot of private equity in the space right now, and they look at the results. You know, we've had this long cycle where commercial and defense have done very well. And we're, I think, very good at operating in this space and we understand where the landmines are. And I think that there are a number of companies out there which are being bid up at really, you know, prices that don't make sense. And so, to answer your question, if it's a high-quality company and we think that we can accelerate the growth, would we be more aggressive on it? Sure. However, if \u2013 you know, a lot of these businesses don't meet that criteria, and, you know, frankly, people look at HEICO and they say, well, you know, these guys didn't know what they were doing and they entered this business 31 years ago. Look at how well HEICO has performed with the stock. I don't know, it's 20% something CAGR over 31 years without any leverage, you know, how hard can this be? And, you know, they get into this space and they realize, in fact, it's pretty hard.  And we've got people who really know what they're doing and we've got this unique product offering where we're able to combine PMA, repair and distribution into the aftermarket, and have, you know, outside of a couple of the \u2013 you know, the airframe, engine or a couple of the large component OEMs. We've got the largest aftermarket sales force, and it's extremely synergistic where these businesses are able to feed business to each other and we've learned a tremendous amount along the way. So, \u2013 and then the other thing I would say, we're also fairly conservative when we look at them in terms of inventory reserves and in terms of not pressing, you know, the pricing on below \u2013 you know, we want to make sure that we've got a very good business for generations to come. And we're not trying to, you know, if you will, burn the furniture, you know, take everything out of the fields in order to hit our numbers. And that is the culture that we've created and our people understand that.  And so, I think that when you look at some companies that may really be doing things in the short-term in order to get a high price and then they want to get a high multiple of that, honestly, that's somewhat of a fool's errand and not something that we want to do. So sorry for the long answer, but if it truly is a HEICO run company, yes, you know, HEICO style run company, yes, we would pay a higher price for it. But frankly, we haven't \u2013 you know, you don't see that very often. So \u2013 and then, with regard to larger transactions, as our [debt] says, we \u2013 you know, HEICO is very open to all sorts of different transactions. We believe that we've got a differentiated model in terms of how we run the business and how we treat our people. And so, yes, if we found a larger deal, we would, you know, definitely want to go ahead and act on it. But, you know, of course, there can be no assurance and my comment should not be meant \u2013 should not be interpreted as there's one on the horizon. But we're always focused on where we can grow. And, you know, frankly, by having this culture, we really \u2013 you know, in a sense, it's like planting, you know, a lot of seeds in the ground to make sure that the future is going to be very good, and we've got that. And we're very confident on the future because of that. And even when a crisis happens like this, we treat our people very nicely because, you know, as we say, they are our greatest asset. And if you don't treat \u2013 other people may say, their people are the greatest asset and then they go and cut them and do all sorts of things, whereas HEICO has been willing to suffer the financial consequences of creating our people, right. You know, we're not afraid to go ahead and have reduced earnings so we can come out of this thing, very strong.  So acquisitions really need to line up like that and we've made a number of them, where, you know, typically the founder entrepreneurs share that same vision, where they really put the people ahead of short-term profits because they know that that leads to long term, you know, superiority. So, I hope that answers your question, but if not, I'd be happy to expand on it in any way. I think all things would be on the table. Frankly, it's our preference to use cash because we're believers in the stock. You know, the stock has performed extremely well. And if you look at the 82 acquisitions we've made to-date, I don't think that we've given out more than a million dollars of stock and billions of dollars of acquisitions. So, now with the added flexibility that we've got with our new line of credit that, you know, Carlos worked so hard to arrange, we've got a lot of flexibility there. But yes, I mean, we would be open \u2013 I mean, one of the things that we need to be open to is some people may be concerned at selling it, if you will, you know, a lower point in the cycle. So therefore, they may request our stock as a way to be able to play, you know the up-cycle. So, I think in that case, we would be sensitive to it, but cash is definitely our preference. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, Josh. Hi. Yes, I would say that we maintain \u2013 this is Eric, we maintained our pace of PMA. You know, we could have increased it. I think one of the things which is \u2013 and why we've got, you know, plenty of opportunity, one of the things that we also have to be a little sensitive to is that a lot of people, including ourselves, took pay reductions this year. Some people were furloughed. There were some layoffs. And we wanted to be sensitive to make sure that the, if you will, the pain was \u2013 you know, the sacrifice was throughout the company. So while we could have increased new product development, you know, we kept it consistent thinking that that was really the right thing in order to show that everybody in the company was in this together. Having said that, I'm very proud that we've come out with, you know, the similar number of PMAs that we've done. I can tell you that we're very aggressively developing new products. Our subsidiaries really have a very good grasp on the products that they're going after and we continue to grow into adjacent whitespaces. Our airline customers and defense customers are very confident about the use of these products. So, I'm \u2013 you know, it gives me a great \u2013 you know, a great optimism for the future, especially when talking to our sales executives and going through the details with them and seeing why they too are very optimistic. Well, I think, the first half is going to, sort of be a continuation of what we've seen, you know, frankly, since May, where we've been coming out of the bottom. You know, it sort of comes out in fits and starts and, you know, it moves ahead, then it sort of settles in and then it moves ahead and then it settles in. And I really would anticipate more of that type of progress, I would say, probably through \u2013 you know, or until perhaps the beginning or through our second quarter. Then what we've seen is, you know, when you talk to the airlines, they're operating the equipment in excess of what, you know the spare parts that they are purchasing. Early in the crisis, there was a destocking phenomenon. I don't really see that anymore. I think the airlines are now very much living hand to mouth and I think that destocking has occurred already. So, in terms of products going forward, I think, you know, it's going to be our standard mix of products. I think airlines will continue to try to defer expensive maintenance as much as possible, however, not in a way that would impact their \u2013 you know, the return to service of the equipment. So, I would say, in general, heavy maintenance and engine visits will be, if you will, the last to recover. And then, you know, with everything improving along the way sort of linear with a flight demand. You know, some of the line maintenance stuff needs to be replaced, even if they're not flying that much than the components. But again, the expensive stuff, we expect, would be definitely stacked to the later part of the recovery. Thank you. You know, I would say it's similar. Oh! Good morning, Greg. This is Eric, I should say. I would say that it is similar between the replacement parts and the repair. You know, it's all in the same ballpark. One could be ahead or behind in a particular month or quarter, but it's all in the similar zip code, I would say. We've spent a fair amount of time studying the market and we're aware of our peers. And I think if an opportunity ever presented itself, you know, we would certainly act on it. I think that we've got a very differentiated model where we treat our people extraordinarily well. And I think for a [seller], you know, whether it's a larger public company or a private company, I think that is a point of value in something which differentiates us. So, yes, we could use, you know, our balance sheet to go ahead and do that and I can tell you that we're always out looking and reviewing, you know, the market out there for these kind of opportunities. And that's regardless of size. You know, the OEMs, our competitors are doing what they've always done. And, you know, they \u2013 we have to fight very hard for each piece of business that we have. I would say nothing really has changed in the playbook. You know, HEICO has become a very well respected, distinguished competitor out there and I think we're continuing to gain share and we're doing very well, so there's really no change, you know, in that regard. You know, having said that, our strategy within the parts business is to take a minority market share. You know, we only go for a 30% market share. So, as long as we're able to pick up that market share, you know, at terms, which makes sense for our customers as well as for ourselves, we, you know, cap that market share, you know, around that level because we want to make sure that our competitors also have a very good, you know, business strategy for their market share.  So, I think that our competitors have got very good \u2013 you know, our OEM competitors have very good business plans. I think they're going to continue to do very well. And I think there's plenty of opportunity for HEICO in there as well. Thank you. I would say, it's really, Ken, the same things that you pointed out. It's price; it's having a competitor; it's having somebody else, you know, large and respected out in the field and that's really, I think, what's driving it. You know, the airlines entered this, you know, recession or this crisis very strong. And then, of course, as time has gone on, you know their business models have really been challenged. And when I speak with our sales folks, you know, they explain to me that, you know, frankly fear, uncertainty and doubt what our competitors, our OEM competitors try to push is reasons why not to buy our product really doesn't hold up. So, they believe that we're going to be able to develop additional products because that's what the customers are asking for. They want us to go into these other products; they want us to develop our \u2013 you know, broaden our product line; and they're willing to buy it. So, as a result, we go ahead and continue to develop it. It's not only on in the parts area, but it's also in the repair area as well. So, I think it will continue to be a very competitive market. But, you know, that's what really gives me the confidence that we're going to do quite well. No, I would say it's all of our areas are where we're continuing to invest. I mean, you hit on all of them, PMA repair and distribution, we see very good opportunities in all of those. I think that we provide a unique balance in all of those businesses. You know, there's obviously the nexus in how they connect across the top, which nobody else can bring. And then, in addition, you know, we operate them as small businesses where we're very knowledgeable about the details and that really helps our customers as well as, our manufacturers, our principals. And then, we've got the balance sheet of a larger organization, so we're able to compete, you know, like a larger company would. So, I think we're in a very unique space. Thank you very much. And let me add, I mean, I can say that, internally, our businesses are budgeting for organic growth. But you know what, we're always, me, in particular, very cautious, very conservative, and I don't \u2013 you know, we like to over deliver, to be honest with you, outperform. And so, you know, I'd rather comment further on that as we get a little deeper into the year, but that's certainly what we're planning for internally. And Mike, this is Eric. Just also to add some color, you know, picking up on, you know, what I answered in one of the questions earlier, we could have generated higher operating margins, but we felt it was really important to take care of our people. And, you know, I think a lot of other companies are very, you know, sort of aggressive with their people. You know, other people say, other companies say their people are the most important, but then they don't act that way. And we've really tried to act that way and as a result, the margin had taken a hit and we have been fully prepared, you know, recognizing that we've got to invest in our people and that's not to say that our team members haven't, you know, shared in the sacrifice because they had tremendously. But we've done everything we possibly could to, you know, hang on to them and to have them sacrifice less than other organizations and we think that HEICO will be rewarded, you know, with their loyalty and dedication coming out of the crisis. So, you know, we're very cognizant of the margins and, you know, and why we think that we can get them to increase moving forward. You know, I let Carlos explain on the specifics. But in general, incentive comp is based on performance. So first, the performance has to be there then the incentive comp will kick in. But Carlos can then explain the details. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. And having said that, I agree completely. You know, I think that our current level of new product development is a good level. It's a level at which we made sure that we've got, you know, a lot of customers and they're excited about the different products that we're coming out with. So, I really expect that we will continue to stay the course. Now if we see, you know, a significant change in the approval rate at our customers, then, you know, we could revisit it. But I would say, right now, we're very comfortable with what we've got going right now. It was also very encouraging to find out that a lot of our customers were working on improving the use of our parts from their homes. And they were, you know, continuing to focus in this area because it continues to be a major cost driver for the airlines. The airlines know very clearly that if HEICO doesn't exist, their prices go way up. And where we're a, you know, significant part of their strategy. Thanks [Noah]. Good morning. So, let me take a look at some of my numbers here. I mean, it was all really in the same \u2013 as I said, the same ballpark there. So, I wouldn't say that there was much of a difference. You know, in any one quarter, one can be, you know, based on the prior comp, one can be ahead, you know, versus the other. You know, if you look at 2019, in the fourth quarter, we had 12% organic growth in Flight Support and on against the comp in 2018, 13% growth. So it's 25% growth over, you know, two annual quarters there. So things can move around, you know, based on this.  You know, in general, I would say that the parts and \u2013 the parts business would be down less than the component repair. The way that that normally works is in component repair, you can end up having some in the pipeline, which has been approved by the customers. So there can be a little bit of a lag there. And as a result, it could lag where the component repair comes back a little after the parts come back because first they have to procure the parts in order to be able to do the component repair. But I would say that it was all, you know, in a similar ballpark. Component repair was down more than parts, but I wouldn't get too wrapped around that because it can vary a little bit, as I said, quarter-by-quarter. You're welcome. It's similar to Q3, I'd say. Thank you, Colin. I'm glad you asked that because we went on to the next question before we had an opportunity to answer on that. Yes, we \u2013 I would say that we're \u2013 we continue to be encouraged based upon the conversations that we've heard. You know, we don't like to speak about, you know, particular product lines or customers, but we do believe that there's been good progress in that area. It has sent a very clear message regarding engine, you know, alternative parts for engines, whether it's PMA or DER repair. So again, I think that it \u2013 there have been, you know, nice conversations and some good \u2013 you know, good results coming out of that enforcement action. Thank you."

My name is Vincent, and I'll be your conference operator. As we being the call, we remind you that certain statements in this conference call will constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and contingencies. HEICO's actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements as a result of factors, including the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. HEICO's liquidity and the amount and timing of cash generation; the continued decline in commercial air travel caused by the outbreak; airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demand for our goods and services; product specification costs and requirements, which could cause an increase to our cost to complete contracts; governmental and regulatory demands; export policies and restrictions; reductions in defense, space or Homeland Security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers or competition from existing and new competitors, which could reduce our sales and profitability. Our ability to introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce our sales, sales growth, our profitability; product development or manufacturing difficulties, which could increase our product development and manufacturing costs and delay sales; our ability to make acquisitions and achieve operating synergies from acquired businesses; customer credit risk; interest, foreign currency exchange and income tax rates; economic conditions within and outside of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications, and electronic industries, which could negatively impact our costs and revenues; and defense spending or budget cuts, which could reduce our defense-related revenue and profitability. Parties listening to or reading a transcript of this call are encouraged to review all of HEICO's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. I'd now turn the call over to Laurans A. Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, and thank you and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and welcome you to the HEICO Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members who have performed admirably during the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak. Their dedication to HEICO's customers and the safety of their fellow team members has been exemplary. I want each and every member of HEICO's global team to understand that the Board of Directors and I are humbled by your dedication and continued focus on safety and wellbeing during these challenging times. I am confident that our future is bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period as a stronger and more competitive company. At this time, I will take a few minutes to discuss the impact on HEICO's operating results from the outbreak for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2020. The effects of the outbreak and the related actions by governments around the world to mitigate its spread have impacted our employees, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers. In response to the economic impact from the outbreak, we at HEICO have implemented certain cost reduction efforts, including layoffs, temporary reduced work hours, temporary pay reductions within various departments of our business, including within our entire executive management team as well as our Board of Directors. Our response to the outbreak included implementing varying health and safety measures at our facilities, including supplying and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, staggering work shifts, body temperature taking, increasing work-from-home capabilities, consistent and ongoing cleaning of workspaces and high-touch areas, and establishing processes aligned with the Centers for Disease and Control guidelines to work with any individual exposed to COVID-19 on their necessary quarantine period, and the process for the individual to return to work. With respect to the results of operations, approximately half of our net sales are derived from defense, space, and other industrial markets, including electronics, medical, and telecommunications. Demand for products in that half of our business has not been fundamentally impacted and its operational results remain materially consistent with the financial expectations prior to the outbreak. We have experienced and expect to continue experiencing periodic operational disruptions resulting from supply chain disturbances, staffing challenges, including at some of our customers, temporary facility closures, transportation interruptions, and other conditions, which [indiscernible] or increased cost. While these issues have not yet been material overall, we have experienced disruption in some orders and some shipments during the third quarter. The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services. The outbreak has caused significant volatility and a substantial decline in the value across global markets. Most notably, the commercial aerospace industry experienced an ongoing substantial decline in demand resulting from a significant number of aircraft in the global fleet being grounded during our third quarter. Our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry have been materially impacted by the significant decline in global commercial air travel that began in March of this year. Consolidated net sales for our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry decreased by approximately 54% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. As I previously mentioned, we have taken responsible measures to address these reductions in net sales at our affected businesses. Once commercial air travel resumes, cost savings most likely will be a priority for commercial aviation customers, and we anticipate recovery in demand for our commercial aviation products, which frequently provides aircraft operators with significant cost savings. One item that I'd like to point out that we have been asked on calls between last night and this morning, a number of people asked for the dollar amount of account receivable reserves that we set up for the bankruptcy of some small airlines, and that number, the absolute number was $7.5 million. Later on in this call, Carlos can give you more details on how it affects the operating margins and so forth, but the absolute number was $7.5 million. Keep in mind that historically we have been able to make up and possibly collect some of that $7.5 million. At this point, we don't know how much that might be, if any. So we have, as normally do, taken the most conservative approach and reserved the whole amount that could go bad. We believe that our cost savings solutions and robust product development programs will enable us to potentially increase market share and emerge with a stronger presence within the commercial aviation market. Summarizing the highlights of the third quarter, consolidated net income increased 4% to a record $251.7 million or $1.83 per diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $242.2 million or $1.76 per diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $299 million and $313.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $93.1 million or 171% of net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $135.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and equivalents, of $344.8 million compared to shareholders' equity improved to 17.7% as of July 30, down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.7x, less than 1x as of July 31, 2020, and that was down from 0.93x as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we have successfully completed six acquisitions, four of which were completed since the outbreak start. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023, and we plan to utilize our financial flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. I do want to point out that unlike some companies in the aerospace industry, HEICO did not have to go to the market to raise money at what I consider exorbitant rates of 8% or more. So we just went through this financially sound and I think that has really helped us and has proven to be an excellent strategy. In July 2020, we paid the regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, and that represented our 84th consecutive semiannual cash dividend. We did not have to cut the dividend and we were very proud of that. Some companies did cut dividend significantly because of cash flow pressures, we did not. In July 2020, we reported that our Sierra Microwave, VPT, 3D-Plus subsidiaries supplied mission-critical hardware for the Mars 2020/Perseverance mission. The Mars mission is designed to better understand the geology of Mars and seek signs of ancient life by collecting and storing rocks, soil samples for a future return to Earth, while also testing new technology for robotic and human space exploration. We congratulate the many remarkable people who accomplished this first step in this incredible mission, and we are proud of the HEICO companies and team members who contributed to the effort and we are excited for the mission's next stage. Talking about acquisitions, in June 2020, we acquired 70% of the membership interest of Rocky Mountain Hydrostatics, which overhauls industrial pumps, motors, and other hydraulic units, with a focus on the support of legacy systems for the U.S. Navy. The remaining 30% continues to be owned by certain members of Rocky Mountain's management team. And Rocky Mountain is part of our Flight Support Group, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In August 2020, we acquired 75% of the equity interest of Intelligent Devices and Transformational Security. These two companies design and develop and manufacture state-of-the-art technical surveillance countermeasures equipment used to protect critical spaces from exploitation via wireless transmissions, technical surveillance, and listening devices. In summary, I'll say basically spying by unwanted people. These acquisitions are part of Electronic Technologies, and we expect them to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. The remaining 25% interest was acquired by the non-controlling interest holders of a subsidiary in HEICO Electronic that is also a designer and manufacturer of the same type of equipment used basically for different applications. In August 2020, we acquired 90% of the equity interest of Connect Tech. Connect Tech designs, manufactures rugged, small form factor embedded computing solutions. Its components are designed for very harsh environments and primarily used in rugged commercial and industrial, aerospace and defense, transportation, and smart energy applications. The remaining 10% interest continues to be owned by a member of Connect Tech's management team. This acquisition is part of the Electronic Technologies Group, and we expect it to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Fight Support Group's net sales were $731.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to $915.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Fight Support Group's net sales were $178.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $320 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The net sales decrease in the first nine months in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 is principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines, resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020 due to the outbreak. Net sales in fiscal 2020 follows a very strong 12% and 13% organic growth reported in the third quarter and full fiscal 2019 year respectively. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $121.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to $179.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $64.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreased in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales, a lower gross profit margin, mainly within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines, and an increase in bad debt expense, principally due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as a result of the financial impact of the outbreak. These decreases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 16.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to 19.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the impact of the outbreak and previously mentioned higher bad debt expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 4% to a record $638.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $615 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 1%. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower sales of our space, commercial aerospace and other electronics products, largely attributable to the outbreak, partially offset by increased sales of our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales decreased 2% to $210 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, from $216.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease is attributable to an organic net sales decrease of 6% partially offset by the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower shipments of our defense and commercial aerospace products, mainly attributable to the outbreak, partially offset by increased sales of our space products in the third quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 2% to a record $184.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $181.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $61.9 million and $62.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, lower performance-based compensation expense and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales of certain space products and a less favorable product mix of certain aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales of certain defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to 29.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense and lower acquisition-related expenses. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 29.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 28.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales and less favorable product mix of certain commercial aerospace and defense products partially offset by increased net sales and a more favorable product mix of certain space products in the quarter. Now I would like to turn the call back to our Chairman, Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor and Eric. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 32% to $0.40 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $0.59 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group, partially offset by lower income tax expense, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest and lower interest expense. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 4% to $1.83 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $1.76 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. And that increase principally reflects an incremental discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises, which we recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest and lower interest expense, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, that was up slightly from $21.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and totaled $65.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $61.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. R&D expense was $15.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $16.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and it increased 1% to $49 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $48.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Significant new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and Flight Support, and we continue to invest more than 3% of each sales dollar into new product development. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 20% to $75 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, down from $93.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 13% to $232.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $267.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects a concerted effort by both Flight Support and ETG to control their SG&A spend. And these efforts resulted in lower G&A expenses such as a decrease in performance-based compensation expense and a reduction in various selling expense, including outside sales commissions, marketing and travel. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense at Flight Support, which I previously mentioned was $7.5 million, due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result of the financial impact of the outbreak as well as the increase from fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 17.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the after mentioned increase in bad debt expenses due to bankruptcy filings made by certain commercial aviation customers and higher other SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales due to decreased sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percent of net sales decreased to 17.1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, down from 17.7% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is mainly due to again, lower performance-based compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in other SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and an increase in the bad debt expense, reflecting the previously mentioned bankruptcy filings. Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 down from $5.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and decreased to $10.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $16.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 was principally due to a lower weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 13.4% compared to 22% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects a larger deduction related to foreign-derived intangible income, principally resulting from final tax regulations that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 as well as a larger income tax credit for qualified R&D activities. Our effective tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was 3.5% compared to 17.1% in the first nine months of 2019. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, which accounted for a majority of the decrease in our year-to-date effective rate. The decrease in the effective rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 also reflects a larger deduction related to the previously mentioned foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as larger income tax credits for qualified R&D activities. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $3.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $16.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to $25 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the impact of the dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 19, 2019, that effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries back to the Flight Support Group and a decrease in operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interests are held. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain extremely strong. As we mentioned earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $299 million and $313.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $93.1 million or 171% of net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $135.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our working capital ratio improved to 5x as of July 31, 2020 compared to 2.8x as of October 31, 2019. Our day sales outstanding, DSOs, of receivables improved to 43 days as of July 31, 2020 and that compared to 45 days as of July 31, 2019. We monitor all receivable collection efforts and try to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales, and our top-five customers represented 25% and 21% of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Inventory turnover increased to 154 days for the period ended July 31, 2020 and that compared to 125 days for the period ended July 31, 2019. The increase in the turnover rate principally reflect certain long-term and non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments based on pre-outbreak net sales expectations and also the necessity to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now looking forward, the outlook. We cannot estimate the outbreaks duration and magnitude, and we cannot confidently predict when demand for commercial aerospace products will return to pre-outbreak levels. However, we do continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. We entered the outbreak with a healthy balance sheet that included a strong cash position and nominal debt. We believe HEICO is favorably positioned for long-term success despite the short-term challenges created by the outbreak in the global economy. This COVID pandemic will not last forever. Our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring an operating high cash generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aviation such as defense, space and other high-end markets, including electronic and medicals puts us in a good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. I would like to end my remarks by again thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team is focused on your safety and professional success. We will exit this outbreak stronger than before, and that strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, mutual respect for one another, the unwavering pursuit of exceeding customers\u2019 expectations. And we thank you all for all that you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. And I would like to add, I also thank our loyal shareholders who have stuck by HEICO and sent us many, many positive comments and thanks, and we truly appreciate your interest and support. And now I would like to open the floor for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: Thank you for all of the detail. I just wanted to perhaps dig in a little bit. Eric, maybe we could start with FSG and just talk about the different businesses within FSG and their varying performances, if you will, the parts overhaul distribution. And then if you could talk a little about the trend between the months. In other words, did May mark bottom? And how did June and July look? And then I have a couple of other things after that.\nEric Mendelson: Sure, Rob. Let me start with the trend. We were \u2013 back in May, when we said we were hopeful that May would mark the bottom, in fact, May was the bottom, and we were able to bounce nicely off of the May numbers into June and July. And I would say they were sort of consistent in that level. In terms of reviewing the businesses within the parts side, of course, we've got the PMA and we've got the distribution, and I would say that they were down sort of in the similar area. Repair was down a little bit more and that was to be expected as airlines we anticipated would reduce whatever expenditures that they saw. Specialty products, I would say, was down a little less in the beginning of the pandemic, but I think now as people recognize that the build rate is going to be reduced, I think the suppliers to the OEMs, including the HEICO businesses that do that are going to be impacted sort of longer than the aftermarket is going to be impacted. I reviewed with our sales executives the customer sales and how we're doing by product lines and by customers and it's sort of interesting to note that while the business is down, the percentage that we reported, there are certain airlines that are down very significantly, I would say, 96%, 90%, 88%, 87%, and these are major customers. I don't want to mention their names and I don't want to mention their geographies, but I can tell you that these are major airlines that are not going to be able to operate. I mean, they're operating 30% to 50% of their flights and yet their purchases are down in the 90s. And obviously, that is not a sustainable model. I think that they \u2013 our people believe that they entered the crisis with lean inventories and my sense is that they are \u2013 they've used up or they're using up whatever they've got. And this is not going to last indefinitely. So to answer your question, I think that the OEM market will be down longer for the new build and for the reasons that airlines don't need the aircraft, but I do believe that the aftermarket will start to snap back.\nRobert Spingarn: And did you see \u2013 did July improve from June?\nEric Mendelson: July did improve from June, but I would be careful to sort of extrapolate that improvement going forward because as we've seen with the sort of the late July increase in infection rate, of course, that's now come down, I mean, that would, obviously, sort of put a damper on the increases going forward. So I think very much it's going to be related to the infection rates into the progress on a therapeutic as well as a vaccine. But the one thing which I am extraordinarily hopeful of and very, very positive on is, when I met with our salespeople, who are probably on this call, and we reviewed the customers in detail, I gave them every opportunity to tell me why the future would be tough and why I should \u2013 why things maybe difficult coming out and sort of for them to set expectations low. And I can tell you that to a person they were extraordinarily optimistic. They think that \u2013 and they gave me specifics as to why HEICO has increased its credibility with the customers that were a significant aviation, a company now, if you look at our market cap versus other companies, and they believe that we're going to come out of this significantly stronger than we've come out of any of the other prior crises, and they gave me the specifics, which I don't want to mention for competitive reasons on this call, but I believe that we're going to be in a very strong shape to come out. So I guess, what you're getting to is, when do we think things will get better? Of course, we don't know, but the one thing we are 100% certain of is they will get better and we will emerge definitely stronger than we've ever been.\nRobert Spingarn: And just on that, Eric, while some airlines are underperforming the traffic numbers, as you just mentioned, are others starting to recognize your value proposition? Are you gaining any market share here? And I wanted to call out China, specifically, since it sounds like PMA has not yet really penetrated that one region.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I mean, as you know, we are hesitant to talk about specific regions or customers. We pretty much deal with everybody. So it's not so much getting new customers for us as it is selling customers more of our product line. And I'm very optimistic that we are going to be selling. I've seen a lot of specifics on customers interested in and working on improving product that they had not in the past. Our time has come. There is no reason that if somebody is buying X percent of our product line, they shouldn't be buying the entire product line. And we've got, I believe, the best people in the field. One of the reasons why our results and margins were better than expected, but lower than we would have liked is because while there was a lot of shared sacrifice in terms of furloughs and reduced hours and reduced pay, we've done everything we could and we can to keep our people, whether it's the new product development folks or the sales folks, quality, purchasing, everything to keep our people on our payroll because we believe that we're going to come out this extremely strong, and we don't want to be caught flatfooted. We've got a number of peers in the industry, who I believe were very aggressive with their reductions, and I think that is going to hamper them coming out, whereas HEICO has continued to maintain that infrastructure.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. I'll leave margins for the next person, but, Victor, just quickly on your side, I just was going to ask if you talk a little bit more about the decline in sales in the quarter and the impact of COVID, and how you think that sets up here for the fourth quarter in terms of organic growth?\nVictor Mendelson: Thanks Rob. This is Victor. Maybe taking it a little bit in reverse order and thinking about the fourth quarter, which, of course, we're in right now, I'm not sure where things will wind up exactly within the fourth quarter. I could see us being up 5% or 10% just as easily as I could see us being down 5% or 10% in the fourth quarter, and that sort of gets into then the first part of your question and the kind of things that we're dealing with. And so, of course, commercial aviation that part of ETG is down, and it's comparable to what we're seeing within the Flight Support Group \u2013 in the commercial aviation businesses within the Flight Support Group. And I expect that to have a trajectory that will be comparable to what we experienced in the Flight Support Group. So the other part that has impacted some of the markets, the more general markets that we've talked about, that are serving the broader economy, some of the harsh environment markets have been slower and \u2013 or have slower demand, not dramatically, but you'll see 5% to 20% down in some product lines and things like that. So that's kind of the part of the business that's just a little bit slower. And then you get to the part that isn't slower, right, that has strong orders that remains healthy, which is the bulk of the business and that's in the defense and space side. And what we continue to see are disruptions that we talked about in the early part of the call that comes from \u2013 generally, it's supply chain side of it, but sometimes the customer side where, let's say, on the supply chain, it's deliveries, we\u2019ll have a supplier, which is experiencing their own outbreak issues in their plant, and they will have a line go down or something in there two weeks or four weeks later, something like that. We have it \u2013 and then they\u2019re late delivering to us, and then in turn that slows us down. And so you see things just kind of moving out nothing dramatic, but things can move out for a month or two weeks or something like that, and it shifts it from one quarter to the next. And then on the customer side, we will see the same kind of effect, where they will be closed or they will be at half staffing or something like that for two weeks or four weeks, and PO doesn't get out and the order doesn't get placed, and then we have decisions to make. Well, we know it's coming. Do we go ahead? Do we build ahead? And we generally don't take a lot of risk on building ahead and committing capital far in advance ourselves. We grapple with those decisions. We've got actually some government customers. I won't obviously name who they are, but you've got government customers who can't work online. They can't have their people working from home for security reasons, and they are at 30% or 50% staffing levels, and so they are delayed simply because they have people on these rotating shifts, and they're like one month on and one month off, it's just stuff like that. So no fundamental change. The demand is there, and it eventually gets placed. So we're very optimistic about those, and that's why I say it could just as easily be up 5% or 10% as down 5% or 10%. I don't think anything dramatic fortunately, and overall pretty, pretty healthy, but it makes it difficult to forecast, if you will, at the margins. Keep in mind one other thing when you look at the business, you look at the ETG for example, and you're talking about a business that's couple of hundred million-ish in a quarter, 1% is about $2 million, a little bit more, but that 1% is about $2 million. And you have a few businesses that shift by just a few hundred thousand dollars, and it moves from one quarter to the next, then you have a small number of businesses where that happens. It can have an effect where you have 1% or 2% or 3% of organic growth all of a sudden disappears and moves.\nRobert Spingarn: Just a final detailed point. Would you call any difference or major difference out between space and defense in terms of either supply issues or demand issues?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, in space \u2013 when I talk about space, I'm really referring to the commercial space part of it. On the supply chain side, no, not so much because the issues that face people and companies are similar, and so if you have a space supplier who is delayed, and he can just easily the defense guy who is delayed. I mean, we all saw this on the F-35, right, that they're going to have a delay in testing them and simulation, right, last week. So on the supply side, it can be the same. It's just sort of a luck of the draw and commercial space, of course, as we've talked about in the prior calls that the shipments now are picking up to match the orders that we talked about, which had been accelerating and there has been an improvement on our commercial space side as we expected.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you very much.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Rob. Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Arment. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Larry, Victor and Eric.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Peter.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Good morning. Eric, just to follow-up on Rob's \u2013 left me the margin question, so I'll ask it. Just how you're thinking about the kind of the decrementals were, I guess, in kind of looking at high 30s. How you think about margins kind of trending from here, if clearly this 3Q was kind of the trough from an overall topline perspective?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Peter, and thanks for your question. So if you add back the bad debt reserves that we had in the third quarter, the Flight Support Group's operating margin was around 11%, the adjusted operating margin. And of course, we had no way of knowing the impact of what these bad debt charges would be when we originally said at the end of our second quarter call that the Flight Support Group would operate in the breakeven area with sales down 50% to 60%. So I think we did, sales-wise, much better than we expected as well as margins much better than we expected. And going forward, it really depends on the slope of the recovery. We're very optimistic that we will recover and we're going to come back much stronger than when we went in. But the period of time that it's going to take for that recovery is difficult at this point. But I would say probably somewhat comparable, if I were to guess, to the third quarter.\nPeter Arment: On an adjusted basis, right?\nEric Mendelson: Correct. And Carlos, I think, has something to add here.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. Hi, Peter. Good morning. I would say that the bad debt expense, even though it was kind of this one-time period-type cost that we don't like to see. It is something that's hard to control when airlines have bankruptcies. We probably had 20 airlines during the quarter declared reorganizations or Chapter 11. So our policies are to just basically write that stuff off, put a reserve up against it when we see that occurring. And if we get paid great, we hope to get paid, but nonetheless be conservative about it. Now as a result of that, and I talked about at the end of Q2, we have continued to really scrub our receivables and our customer base and make sure that credit that we're granting to our customers aligns with their financial strength in hopes that we \u2013 and continue to not extend ourselves in any one particular customer. So I think we've got \u2013 well, I can't predict whether there'll be more bankruptcies. I do believe that we have very conservative and very practical policies around receivables. And hopefully, ex this Chapter 11s, we won't see this type of charge in the future.\nPeter Arment: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up question on just M&A. You\u2019ve six deals this year, I think four since the pandemic in terms of \u2013 so clearly, your ability to execute deals remains on a good pace. What are you seeing in the M&A environment? Do you see that \u2013 are there more deals that you think now that are coming available? Or how are you approaching it, I guess, particularly if you're looking at anything on the FSG line?\nLaurans Mendelson: Pete, this is Larry. We see a lot of books coming across our desk. We think the motivation are probably twofold. One, some companies feel under pressure. They've seen their markets shrink and so forth, and they would like to have a strong financial partner. So that's one thing. The other thing is that the talk of a Biden win, increase of capital gain tax to 43.5% or something like that is really scaring the hell out of a lot of people and including me. And I must tell you that we are seeing more books than we can handle. And also, because of the logistics of doing due diligence and you know, we do a very thorough due diligence in-house. It takes longer because you can't go out, you can't access the facilities and so forth, but I would say that the M&A pipeline is really very, very strong. And I also think that we're seeing much more reasonable pricing. And I think that we will over the next six, 12 months have some very excellent opportunities.\nEric Mendelson: And Peter, this is Eric. Also, I want to add that due to our capital structure and the culture at HEICO of valuing our team members because, frankly, they're the ones who make the company. When times are tough like this, we stick by our people, we stick by our programs. We're not highly levered. We don't swing around and cut very deeply. So as a result, I think when sellers look at HEICO, our businesses go through various cycles, but they want to be connected with somebody who is going to be patient and work with them, and frankly, not kill them and run them out the door the first time there's a downturn. And I think when you look at HEICO, you see that that's the case and that's something that we try to articulate. And I think is one of the reasons why we continue to be the acquirer of choice. We're very busy flying around, meeting with management teams with entrepreneurs and very, very much focused on continuing to make acquisitions and use our way under levered balance sheet.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate all the details. Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions. First, any commentary on August trends at FSG? Has that sort of continued the linearity of improvement that you talked about during the July quarter?\nEric Mendelson: This is Eric, Gautam. No, I would say since it's really outside of our \u2013 it's not included in our third quarter, we'd rather not comment on it. However, I think it's reasonable to expect \u2013 if you look at the general \u2013 as I mentioned before, if you look at the general sort of infection rate trend, what's going on in the economy. I think it's logical to assume that things are a little flattish right now, but I think people are optimistic that it will recover. So the only question is exactly when that recovery occurs.\nGautam Khanna: Got it. And just on that point, have you seen customers that have not been as aggressive in using PMA starting to inquire more about it so that will actually \u2013 maybe you'll see greater customer adoption of the overall Americas?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Unequivocally, yes. There has been a lot more interest, definitely. With airlines under the gun, having to show reduced cost for the same, if not improved performance, absolutely. And that's what gives me so much confidence for the future.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. That's helpful. At ETG, Victor, could you \u2013 maybe you said it, but I just wanted to make it clear for myself. In terms of underlying demand, so there's this timing on shipments which a customer may or may not be onsite to accept delivery and that can swing the organic growth rate around. But can you \u2013 what do you think the underlying demand growth is right now? Do you think it is kind of low-single digits? And so we do see a catch up to 5% to 10%. Maybe it's not in Q4, but at some point, this draws in later? How do you \u2013 if you put it all together, how would you aggregate underlying demand at this point?\nVictor Mendelson: It's a good question, and I'm not trying to be cute or evasive. It's difficult to assess that now because of some of those disruptions I was talking about, where we have customers who are not there, sort of missing in action. And all of a sudden, they're there and placing big orders and hurrying up or asking us to rush because they were out for two weeks or a week or a month or something like that. So it's difficult to assess. On the defense demand and space, it feels robust. And when they show up \u2013 if they're not there, all of a sudden it's slow and then it picks up, it seems to make up very nicely, where it does seem to be lagging, as I said, are in some of those other markets that we serve. But then again, we'll see something \u2013 it'll have a feel of lagging, and then the customer shows up and says, okay, look, we really need to hurry up. Can you ship faster? And we have a bunch of orders. Is there anything you can do to trim the lead times? So I really hate to be evasive on this or to seem evasive, but I would prefer not to give you any percentage field at this point until we've got some better clarity, which I'm hoping maybe in three or six months, we will and have a better sense.\nEric Mendelson: Remember one thing, Gautam, and we said this historically quite often, we are very customer focused. And if our customers are struggling, not there or whatever, we're not going to put something in the mail and send it to them and say tough. We want to make sure that we're easy to do business with, and then our customers respect our flexibility. And our structure is uniquely done in a way that it can handle that ad hoc. We're not one big monolithic organization. We have multiple subsidiaries all over the place, and they're close with their customers and they monitor and deal with this. And I think what that will do for us going forward and into the future is that we\u2019ll endure even more to our customer base and will allow us to move forward with an even stronger position with all of these customers. So I agree with Victor. We can't really give a percentage because we're not so focused on that. But what I do know is that our customers appreciate the way we're handling this right now. And I think that's going to pay dividends for us in the future.\nGautam Khanna: I appreciate that. And if I may, just on FSG, on the repair side of the business, are you seeing customers in-source more of that stuff? Or is there \u2013 do you think there's been no change to how the customers are actually looking to sell? I'm just wondering how much is like underlying demand versus in-house.\nVictor Mendelson: Got it. No, I don't think they've in-sourced. I think that there hasn't been much change. If anything, it\u2019s probably going to be greater outsourcing due to the people cuts that they've been forced to make. So I think our component repair people are very wired in and are very optimistic on a number of really good opportunities.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And Larry last one for you. On M&A, you talked about the pipeline, but are there any larger transactions that you think are maybe more likely in this downturn that could come your way? Or are these going to be more of the tuck-in variety that's characterized the recent\u2026\nLaurans Mendelson: We're an opportunistic acquirer. In the M&A field, we really manage our cash. And I think that's one of the secrets to our success. We don't put out money unless we get a return on those funds and they pay for themselves. So it's not size that gives us bottom line earnings and cash flow. If we have a good opportunity with a great seller or an operator, we\u2019ll take advantage of it. We also, as you know, use the policy of having sellers retain a percentage to keep them interested and involved, and that's been a very successful formula. Now as far as the size of the trend, we do look at larger transactions and we consider them. Would we like to do a larger transaction? Yes, as long as it meets the standards that we set. We're not going to do a big transaction and dilute everything and dilute cash flow and build up debt and so forth without getting a strong return, which we like to get. So we have been successful in compound \u2013 remember, our goal is compounding our bottom line at 15% to 20%. So we will make acquisitions and internal organic growth to meet that goal. And if a large acquisition is available, we'll do it. And if we have to go smaller bolt-ons that really generate cash, we'll do it. Just as an example, the companies that we buy, we check based upon their historical performance, cash flow and everything, normally paid for themselves in seven to 10 years. By the time we get to the third or fourth year on a look-back, what we have invested, the initial investment less what we have taken out of the company or the companies produce cash for us, we probably have them sitting in our portfolio at anywhere from 2x to 4x EBITDA. So I mean they're producing more cash annually than \u2013 I mean it's amazing. That is why you get the results that you get or we get the results that we get. So to me and to us and our team, it's all about the cash flow return. And that is more important than the earnings per share. Although, we know if we have cash flow, we will have earnings per share. We can have earnings per share, but no cash flow, as you very well know. So that's what we will continue to focus on that strategy. I hope that's answered your \u2013 Gautam, does that answer your question?\nGautam Khanna: Yes. It does. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Take care.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Larry Solow. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nLawrence Solow: Great. And good morning, guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Larry.\nLawrence Solow: Good morning. Just Larry, let's stick with the acquisition theme and just a follow-up on that. And I know HEICO historically has very high standard. Has COVID changed or broadened your potential net at all? I realized you can't simply look through COVID. So just trying to get a little bit of a gauge on how you \u2013 sort of online how you're looking at companies a little bit differently because of COVID?\nLaurans Mendelson: I don't think so, Larry. I think we're looking at them in the same way. As you know, we don't want to pay for a hockey stick. And most deals \u2013 and as you well know, the investment banker shows you a hockey stick and he tells you next year and the year is going to be greater, so therefore, pay for it upfront. We normally don't buy into that unless we can feel comfortable in due diligence that they really have the orders on the books and so forth and so on. So the COVID, we are trying to structure deals where we pay for what we get on a current basis and then offer the seller earn-outs or partnerships so the seller can really have his cake and eat it, too. They can secure a down payment as a percentage of the total, and then over the next three, four, five, six years, they can make up the difference if in fact the company earns it. So this kind of protects us on the downside and it protects the seller on the upside. Obviously, that structure appeals to a lot of people. And we think and they think it's a very fair structure.\nVictor Mendelson: Larry, this is Victor. And keep in mind, we're not buying and we're not trying to be commodity transactors. We are working with people who care about their businesses and care about what they've created and care about their people. So this is not just like they\u2019re selling a piece of land or a building or something and they're agnostic, it's what transpires post closing. They really want a good home for the business. And that is as much a part of this. It's not just about finding a price and moving on, although obviously price is important. I mean they're selling to have some security and liquidity and other things. So that's all part of the consideration that goes into it for us. And I think that's very much what distinguishes us. And if you look at the transactions, the acquisitions we made recently, one of them was a company we've been talking with for four years and getting to know for four years. And they were not for sale. They were not in a process at all. They had no investment banker and it was just our typical type of transaction. The other two companies, one of them was not for sale either, and as part of the process of buying the first either the two related companies, which was kind of going through a process, which they truncated for us because of the relationships they had with one of our other companies and other people they knew at one of our other companies, and they said, these are the people we want to sell our business to. And then in the discussions, the business that was related to that, we sort of convinced them that we'd like to put it all together and do something exciting together. That was part of that, and I think we get an advantage out of it.\nLawrence Solow: Yes. No, absolutely...\nVictor Mendelson: But one thing we won't do by the way is, we're not going to do a deal just for the sake of doing a deal. We're not going to force a bad deal because we own forever. And we don't look to sell. It's not like private equity or we're not just stacking in on like some sort of Ponzi scheme, where \u2013 we'll get some growth this year and who cares what happens next year, it's got to work forever.\nLawrence Solow: Right, and that makes total sense. I would appreciate that color. And just shifting gears on maybe a question for Eric, just on everyone is, obviously, trying to figure out when we might see a turnaround, and clearly we're getting a little bit of \u2013 hopefully, we've bottomed. But as we look at TSA, I guess the traffic number is still down like 70% I think, the most recent number. So fair to say with that number, a good indicator, and if that doesn't rapidly improve, which are probably won't in the near-term, that revenue performance will be sort of similar to where it's been without a change in that or further improvement in that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Hi. Larry, I would say that is pretty much, correct. With the exception that I mentioned earlier in the call that a number of our customers are operating down in the 90% area and that is just not sustainable. And these guys are flying aircraft and it is just impossible for them to not purchase the parts. So I do think that we could have a \u2013 we may do better than that, and I think naturally as they run out of inventory. So I guess the short answer to your question is, even if things stay where they are, I would expect a rebound, because they've drawn out the inventory.\nLawrence Solow: Inventories, right?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it's going to come back quicker. But definitely the number of flights is something that we watch very closely, but they can't continue operating at the levels that they are at.\nLawrence Solow: Yes, understood. And then maybe just a last question just for Carlos. Carlos, you mentioned I think you had close to 20 bankruptcies this quarter, and you've scrubbed your accounts receivables and hard to predict future bankruptcies, but obviously the initial shake out seems like it was \u2013 do you feel like we should slow down and hopefully not see this kind of volume of bankruptcies and impact on your performance going forward?\nCarlos Macau: Hey, Larry, thanks for the question. So my view on that topic is as follows. Most of the large domestic, whether it's U.S., Europe, China or wherever, they are getting some sort of government assistance and candidly these airlines are in many cases the pride of many of these countries. And so I feel like the ones that have been shaken out in Q3, candidly were some of the ones I was worried about at the end of Q2, and I brought that up on our conference call and played out. I don't think at the moment that I'm as concerned. One thing that we have done, as you just mentioned, is we did rationalize some of our credit exposure. We did a pretty deep study on that to make sure that we were appropriately supporting our customers, but that we weren't \u2013 they weren't using us as a bank candidly, and we won't do that going forward. We haven't in the past by the way. So as we're sitting here today, yes, I am obviously concerned about further bankruptcies, but at the moment, I feel like they've been supported either through additional debt, equity offerings or government assistance that I think will get them to the next point when traffic picks up, and we all move forward. So that's my view on it right now. Obviously, that could change, and a dime of things got worse, but we're not thinking that that will be the case right now.\nLawrence Solow: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks again, guys. I appreciate it.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks, Larry.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nJoshua Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nJoshua Sullivan: Yes, just a follow-up on that deferred maintenance conversation and the unsustainability of inventories. And so, I mean, if TSA traffic does stay at these current levels, when do you think that crossover point is in the current demand levels that deferred inventory just has to be addressed? I mean, do you see it early 2021? Could it start later this year, just curious on the timing when you might see that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Hi. It's a good question Josh, and it's something which I think about quite a bit. I think that it could start later this year. I just don't see how these airlines can continue operating with the low level of purchases that they've had. So my thought is that it could be quickly, but certainly in 2021.\nJoshua Sullivan: Got it. And then can you just give us some color on any differences and how the main line legacy airline carriers and the low cost carriers are handling the current environment maybe versus previous downturns?\nEric Mendelson: I would say that, in general, everybody went into the downturn with much lower inventories than they had in the prior downturns, whether it was the global financial crisis in 2008, 2009 or the U.S. carriers when 9/11 happened, the international carriers with SARS, they went in with much leaner inventories. So I anticipate the snap back to be quicker than perhaps it has in the past.\nJoshua Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, guys and thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Eric, I guess just along the last lines of questioning, I actually thought organic growth \u2013 organic decline within FSG was pretty decent down 44%, just considering what capacity is doing and your short cycle nature of your business. So maybe can you talk about why you think there is a 25 point, 30 point delta between capacity and aftermarket revenues?\nEric Mendelson: Sure. Good morning, Sheila. Yes, part of that of course is our defense exposure, which has mitigated the impact. The other portion to a lesser extent was really our specialty products, which is primarily OEM related. Now I do anticipate the OEM-related products to be down sort of longer because we expect the new build rates are going to be down. But I think this points to the importance of the HEICO products out there. We offer great cost savings. We're very aggressive on developing new products. We've got a lot of stuff in the pipeline. And I think that we're going to be a very key part of our customers' recovery plans. HEICO is well capitalized. We kept our sales people out in the field. We didn't do like other companies where they really slammed cost and got rid of engineering. I mean we've kept all that. So I think that that's really helping us at this time.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: And then maybe just two more for you, Eric, you mentioned that folks are liking your products, and I think you said top-five customers account for 25% of consolidated sales. So I know that's partially split with Victor, but how do you think about expanding that top-five customers? Are you seeing any swings, incremental pickups from other regional airlines?\nEric Mendelson: We are. We're out there with all other airlines. We want to give them as much attention as they will tolerate from us. So we're always out there trying to develop additional customers. And as I mentioned in one of the questions earlier, there is no reason if somebody is buying X percent of our product line that they don't increase and buy all of our product line. And frankly, this is the communication effort that we engage in daily. And I think it's taking hold and that's why our people are very optimistic on our recovery here and why we're going to play a greater role in our customers' fleet plans. When we came out of the financial crisis, I don't know \u2013 I don't recall what HEICO's market cap was at that time, but it's a fraction of what it is today. And today, when we're out there competing with other suppliers, HEICO has got a much larger market cap than they do, and we have a tremendous amount of credibility, and there is no reason why the airlines shouldn't be increasing their exposure with us, especially since we kept up with them during the down cycle, we kept our people, we kept the new product development, we kept shipping them. There were a lot of suppliers who cut off the financially stressed customers. And while we were careful to manage and only ship them what they needed, we helped keep them in business. So I think that that's going to help us. And while all this roughly $8 million bad debt hit really stinks I think that it plants the seeds for very strong customer relationships going forward.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. That's helpful. And then last question, Eric. I'm sorry, I'm focusing them all on you today, and going all the way back to Peter's question, I just wanted to clarify the bad debt expense, you add it back, we get 11% margins, I get it. The decline was a little steeper than most of your peers, and I think you mentioned you've kept a lot of staff on R&D and sales, etc. How do we think about the way up? Is it still a 30% incremental on the way up? Can you guide us a little bit there?\nCarlos Macau: Hey, Sheila, this is Carlos. So on the decrements, I think for Q3, we were around 37% for this segment. My view continues to be that our decrements resemble a component of fixed costs on our normal margins, which roughly 40%. I do think on the comeback. So as we continue to follow the industry and hopefully outpace the industry, I do think those decrements will shrink or the \u2013 I'm sorry, the add backs or the additional revenue will produce probably higher incremental margins than the decrements were, because we have leaned out in our Flight Support Group a little bit and we'll be piling back that volume on a lower cost basis. So I think that that will be very favorable. But in regards to our competitors, I don't know what competitors you're comparing us to, but I \u2013 just candidly, we \u2013 second quarter, we told folks that if we were down 50%, 60% of the segment, we'd break even. I think we did about what we thought we do. In fact, absent that bad debt charge, I was actually happy, not satisfied, but happy that we were able to produce an adjusted 11% margin and think that if we're looking forward, although we're not giving guidance, I don't expect \u2013 Eric, you can correct me on this if you believe, but I don't expect Q4 margins to be too much different.\nEric Mendelson: Correct. I agree with you. I agree with you.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thank you so much.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nKenneth Herbert: Hi, thanks, good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Ken.\nKenneth Herbert: Hi, Eric. I just wanted to first start with you. Everything you've talked about points to your confidence and you highlighted this in the release of sort of your ability to take share. How do we think about coming out of this what your growth rate should be within FSG relative to the industry in terms of the commercial aftermarket, in particular?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I think we're going to do better than the industry. I think that our cost saving products are going to very much be needed. People are trusting us more. So I anticipate that we're going to come out stronger than the industry.\nKenneth Herbert: I mean you've historically outgrown the industry sort of 1.5x to 2x. Is that a fair benchmark or should we even expect something better moving forward?\nEric Mendelson: It's a tough number to look at, because when we compare it to \u2013 there are many things to compare it to, ASMs, number of flights, revenue passenger miles, aftermarket sales performance of our peers. So I think, no matter what you look at, we're going to outperform it, and sort of the multiple depends on where we are at that moment in time. And remember, one of the things that we typically don't have is the initial provisioning, and that can of course skew the numbers one way or the other. So we don't benefit from that initial provision in general. So ours is really just straight aftermarket usage of parts.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. That's great. And just one final question, as you look at the timing here, you've called out your ability to maybe drive more new product introductions. How do we think about either your investment \u2013 either R&D as a percent of sales maybe or another way to look at it on a percentage basis, how much more do you think you could be bringing product to market to take advantage of the opportunity coming out of the crisis?\nEric Mendelson: Well, we've kept up our new product development. I think whereas many of our peers have slashed new product development, we have not. And that, of course, weighed on our margins. We also did what we could to retain our people, and I think our cuts were significantly less than our peers. So I anticipate that we're going to come out stronger. In terms of number of products, I think it's going to be similar to what we've done in the past. Probably as a percentage of sales, R&D cost is going up because sales have gone down. So \u2013 but we continue to be very bullish.\nCarlos Macau: One of the things, Ken that I would just comment on is that to Eric's point, we're still planning to put out 400 or 500 new parts this year, and that's the cadence that we believe the market can absorb. However, and Eric mentioned this earlier, we strongly believe that not a lot of these airlines are buying everything they can from us and where we're going to get I think the biggest bang, if you would, coming out of this is that these customers will lean into HEICO for these cost savings and look at our existing products that they're currently not buying and really dive into some of those. And I think that's on top of the new products that we introduced to the market, I do think that our existing product base has an opportunity to really expand coming out of this.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Eric or Carlos, if I could just go back to the margin question, I mean, looking at your trailing margins, 18% to 20%, obviously, we're depressed here. I mean, do we need to see a major volume increase for you guys to get back to that level? I mean, if we think about I think some of the market forecasters out there saying the MRO market was $83 billion, it's going to be $35 billion this year, $39 billion next year. I mean, if this market remains depressed and your volumes \u2013 you'll get some pick up here, maybe we get to $200 million revenue quarterly run rate, can you get the margins back into those upper teens or should we be calibrated for sort of this lower double-digit margin environment until we really get volume growth?\nCarlos Macau: [Ken] from our standpoint, we don't think that this is a permanent impairment to the industry. And so we're viewing this as quite temporary, and as a result, as Eric mentioned earlier, we've made what I'll call humane cuts and cost reductions and things like that with the eye toward the future. So I would say in the short-term, we're rolling to standby our employees, standby our team members, and keep the businesses intact to meet that expanded demand and so that's a short-term thing. If this was to become protractive and permanent, then, of course, we would do other things to our business to drive margins up and have our footprint match the demand. However, we think that demand right now is a dislocation and we're not willing to sacrifice customer service, new products and things like that just to meet a short-term quarterly hurdle on the margins. That's how we're looking at it. I don't think that that's going to change and I don't think the future has been enough at this point that we would make radical moves just to improve our margins in the short-term.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. And what is that definition of the short-term? I mean, are you guys thinking this goes on for another three to six months or how are you actually defining the short-term?\nCarlos Macau: As I think Eric mentioned earlier that he viewed the industry could be through the end of this year, where we see softness with a turn. I don't know \u2013 we're not here to predict when that happens. So please [indiscernible] into that. But our view are optimism is that by the end of this calendar year, we should start seeing some volumes and purchases for the sheer fact that these airlines have not been spending the money and they have been flying even though a lot of their fleets on the ground have been flying these planes, so we do expect just natural demand for those planes that are in air are going to kick up some time in the relatively short period.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Mike, it's so hard to pick what the numbers are. I mean, frankly, we thought the third quarter \u2013 I went back and I looked at our internal forecast in May as to what we thought the third quarter would be, and we significantly outperformed that. So it's very hard to guess. The snap backs come when nobody is expecting them, and boom, they just all of a sudden come and then things flatline for a while and then I think they come again. But I do think that people are just itching to get out, and they're being careful getting more comfortable with social distancing, wearing masks and non-aircraft and that sort of thing. But it's just hard to predict exactly when.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Sure.\nEric Mendelson: But I promise you one thing. We're going to be ready for them.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Yes. Got it, and what about on the inventory side, I mean your parts that go to distribution, do you have a good view of what kind of inventories in the channel? And if we were looking at those bankrupt airlines, maybe not all bankrupt airlines, but certainly ones that cease operations like expressed jet, does that inventory hit the marketplace? Are you guys tracking sort of those parts out there, competing parts for the HEICO product line, and any thoughts on that?\nEric Mendelson: No, I think the companies that have had the airlines that have had to reorganize, I think they had very little inventory.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay.\nEric Mendelson: And we work with them to keep them flying to help them out, but I think they had very little inventory. I don't anticipate there being an impact based on that.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay, got it. Last one, Carlos, your inventory up again in this quarter. How should we think about your inventory levels, and maybe how some of that converts to cash here?\nCarlos Macau: Good question. Surprised it took this long to get it. So look as you can imagine, when you're dealing with highly sophisticated electronics, highly sophisticated metals for aerospace and commercial aircraft, you have to put in orders for raw materials, well in advance. And so we're not immune. We're like everybody else. We had a lot of POs outstanding \u2013 non-cancelable POs outstanding going into this in March, where we had a lot of long lead time materials that we committed to. And look we got out of everything we could, but there are certain things that we were committed to we couldn't get out of. So really this quarter was affected by that. We had to take a fair amount of inventory that if we had our druthers, we might not have taken at this time. However, it's all consumable has long shelf life not things that will go bad on us. So from that perspective, I guess, it's an investment in our backlog and when volumes pick up we'll have it available, but that was the inventory jump. I mean that \u2013 when you peel the onion back that's the whole onion right there.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Should that decline next quarter?\nEric Mendelson: I believe so. And I think we're going to have a little bit of that, Mike, but not to the levels we had this quarter.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nLouis Raffetto: Good morning, everyone. How are you?\nEric Mendelson: Good. How are you, Louis?\nLouis Raffetto: Good. So Larry, I appreciate all the detailed information on the M&A and the earn-out offsetting sort of the higher pricing. It's a great point. I guess I just want to get back to the M&A a bit. You guys did two deals so far this year. Can you give any color just so we can get ideas where net debt stands for what you've paid for those deals, also what you think, I guess Victor, can you from an inorganic growth for ETG for the rest of the year, again I know not massive, but just trying to square as much as we can?\nEric Mendelson: I'm sorry...\nVictor Mendelson: Well, I was just going to say it was more than two deals this year, that I was just going to correct, and it's four.\nLouis Raffetto: Yes, four. No. I'm sorry, the three deals that you've done subsequent to the quarter \u2013 that you've done in the fourth quarter?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, got you. So let me hit the net debt question then Victor can talk a little bit about the acquisitions. Coming out of the quarter, we had close to $400 million on the balance sheet. So the impact on net debt is really zero, right, because I used cash to pay for these things. So the impact on our net debt is not going to be anything. So we're okay in that standpoint. Victor, if you want to address?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. I wasn't sure I understood. The question was inorganic growth Louis?\nLouis Raffetto: Yes. Just how much do you expect those \u2013 I mean, you guys don't tend to give a lot of color on individual deals that you've done with these incremental deals. Historically when you've given guidance you've given sort of an organic versus inorganic growth to help us at least get some ideas to what these deals are potentially contributing. Just wanted to know if there is any color you could give as part of these deals?\nVictor Mendelson: Of course, it's late in the year and the Transformational and Intelligent and Connect Tech we just closed, and so they're closed late in the year, and we don't have guidance right for this year, and we're not giving guidance. So unfortunately I can't give anything beyond what we've made public already about the companies other than to say they are sort of typical kinds of transactions that are the entrepreneurial businesses that fit the profile of the kind of companies we buy. They are the typical kind of singles and doubles that we refer to. They're not the swing for the fences kinds of companies that are going to remake HEICO in their entirety. But they're just very nice additive acquisitions, and I think we're just \u2013 we're very happy to have them, but unfortunately I can't give a lot more detail, but I will caution to say I wouldn't go out, for example, and double your earnings estimate of HEICO from these acquisitions. Don't get too aggressive from these.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.\nVictor Mendelson: Trying to be helpful that way, don't get too aggressive.\nLouis Raffetto: Fair. So just again sticking with M&A for one more time, the \u2013 I know you kind of talked about what you are not doing in this environment, I guess, are there any deals that you've put on hold or paused given end-market uncertainty that maybe you're looking at prior to this early this year? You sort of waiting because, to the point, we don't \u2013 no one really knows what the next six months to 12 months look like, and I expect that has some impact on the valuation, maybe it is just goes to that earn out aspect, but just curious if there has been any pausing?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, I'll let Eric talk about some that he has seen. There were \u2013 there was an acquisition that we were working on, that was looking promising. But as we dug in, in the due diligence, it turned out to be, well, a great company. We felt that it wouldn't hold the long-term promise that we thought. Initially it will be great for a couple of years, maybe two, three years, and then would really start to trend in the wrong direction, and that we couldn't really reverse that. So that was one that, early this year I thought was much more likely to happen. And by the way, that's not unusual unless \u2013 it's unfortunately part of what happens, and that's why I made that comment earlier when Larry Solow asked the question about acquisitions that we own forever, and we are really very careful because, obviously, every dollar HEICO invests, we look at it as our own money and do it right. Now, Eric can talk a little about some of the things that he has been working\u2026\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We have seen some deals pause because the future is very uncertain for certain companies, and also we've seen there were a number of deals we had worked on where frankly private equity offered a significantly higher price unless the companies at the altar. And so I mean this is a danger with private equity, and I think some of those could come back around for us as well.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay.\nLaurans Mendelson: Also, I'd like to point out something, I don't know if it came through clearly, but in my remarks I mentioned that we bought 75% of the company call intelligent devices and Transformational Security. We call it TSCM. And that company that we acquired was a direct result of an introduction by another company that we acquired about a year-ago, and these two companies are very compatible in what they manufacture. Different markets, slightly different \u2013 and different products but accomplish similar objectives to the customer. Now many of our acquisitions are as a result of our subsidiary operations getting to know either a supplier, a competitor, or somebody in the industry over a long period of time developing strong relationships, so when we buy a company, we have a pretty good idea of the level of confidence that we will have in the future of owning that company. So we don't shoot in the dark. And again, our strategy, as I mentioned, is bottom line cash flow. And in this particular case, we think we may get some synergies in marketing and may be manufacturing and other things. Those strategies really don't show up in press releases and so forth, but we've made about 78 acquisitions. Carlos, how many \u2013 78?\nCarlos Macau: More or less, yes.\nLaurans Mendelson: 78 acquisitions. And I think you know we've never had a bust, we've never had a company that said, boom, it's no good. So some are better than others, some are little less than we expected, but we have never had a disaster where we had to say, oh, my God, we just made a terrible mistake. So that is our strategy. And I think from an acquisition point of view, it's worked for us. And that's how we've been able to compound our bottom line by about 19% over 30 years and we continue to focus on that. We are not interested in being the biggest company in the world, we want to be a very profitable company, and by that I mean cash flow, one and earnings per share, two.\nLouis Raffetto: Perfect, thank you. And then, sorry, just one quick follow-up for Eric. Thanks for the color on specialty products. I just wanted to clarify. So specialty products is majority OEM, is it commercial aerospace? And you've got 15% exposure to defense and space and FSG. So just trying to get a sense of the mix within the business of where does that defense fall and the specialty products commercial?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So we do defense throughout all of the three sub-reporting groups within FSG. Specialty products is both commercial as well as defense. So it does both.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And \u2013 but the defense exposure, it's kind of even across those segments or is it predominantly in specialty products or any of the others or kind of even-ish?\nEric Mendelson: I would say, percentage wise, it would be higher in specialty products, but I need to look at those specific numbers, because \u2013 how it's all reported, but I wouldn't draw a big distinction on that though.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nColin Ducharme: Hi, good morning, gents. Thanks for taking my question. Couple, please. Just want to start with Carlos. Can you just please assist our understanding, just offering some color on some of the working capital changes, relines in particular? The AR, I think you touched already on, but AP and contract assets. So you alluded to the conservative credit posture informing some of that AR reduction, but is the current liability or AP reduction, is that same motion in reverse just led by your suppliers? And then also if you could just speak to the build-and-contract assets, you touched already on the inventories. What's happening there? Is that signaling potential improving demand trends bouncing off maybe bottom or is this connected at all to any protective builds for any more potential supply disruptions? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. So the contracted assets and liabilities are a function of longer-term commitments by customers on HEICO to a project. So it's not like a build-it-and-ship-it arrangement. It's more where we have different revenue recognition [indiscernible] percent of complete and things like that. So that asset and liability will flex depending on how complete we are in certain projects. So I don't know that you can draw much conclusions from that other than it's going to move north and south depending on how many deposits we get or how much deferred revenue we recognize versus how much progress we make on the WIP related to those particular projects. As far as working capital goes, I was very pleased with the collections for the quarter. AR was down, despite the fact that some of that was due to increasing the allowance. The majority of it was due to extraordinary efforts by our team members to collect on cash. And then, of course, you have lower revenues, which is going to contribute to lower AR balance also. In regards to our payables and our liabilities \u2013 accrued liabilities, within accruals, we're having \u2013 it's a kind of a reference point, we do have less accrued performance-based comp now than we did at the end of October 2019. So that \u2013 we are looking at it comparatively, that has an impact on the accruals, but I will also say that HEICO as a matter of policy have treated our vendors well during this period. We haven't strung them out. We haven't had a need to. And we believe by having those good business practices and not changing, we'll nerd our benefit on a go-forward basis. So that's why you might see a little bit of a decrease in those areas and payables outside of the timing aspects. Philosophically, that's how we think about it.\nColin Ducharme: Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up for Eric and Victor, just want to drill down again on executing against the potential market share gain opportunity amid the crisis, maybe attacking it from a different angle here. Just in particular for FSG and ETG, as you continue to sell into stress verticals like commercial aero, are you trying any new go-to-market sales motions to plant seeds for potential share gains? So for example, bundling service with repair and products perhaps on a contractual basis, improving retention, customer lifetime value, et cetera? I think Eric may have already been alluding to this with a previous response, but just kind of bottom line, how can you leverage HEICO's financial strength, obviously rare, given the current state of the industry just to better gain new toehold and capture incremental wallet share gains that can sustain themselves going forward? Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, Colin. It's a great question, and it is something that we are focused on. And we do have a unique value proposition in that when we do repair. We can offer our proprietary repairs as well as the use of our proprietary parts. So it's up to the customer. If they want the OEM material, we're happy to go ahead and do that, and if they want our material, we're happy to go ahead and sell that as well. But there definitely is close cooperation between our various lines of businesses while they do operate independently for reporting purposes, and so people can really own their businesses, they do cooperate. And there is a lot of that cross selling, and that's one of the reasons why I'm very optimistic about the future and about the way we're going to come out of this.\nColin Ducharme: Okay. So apart \u2013 just a quick clarification though, just from \u2013 apart from historical cooperation among subsidiaries, is there anything different amid this COVID environment, where there is more of a formal frame to enhance or bring in some of that cooperation that perhaps was less of an effort 12 months, 24 months ago before the pandemic hit?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we have increased the cooperation. We are focused on that, absolutely, and that's something that as we continue to broaden the product offerings in each of our businesses, we've got this areas where they can help other businesses and they're very, very much focused on that, absolutely.\nColin Ducharme: Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Great. Thank you, Colin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Rene Plessner. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nRene Plessner: I am Rene Plessner. I am not very good at understanding percentages and market shares, but I am pretty good at respecting and trusting the Mendelson family, who I have known for about 20, 25 years and invested in what I thought was a great business and brilliant businessmen. Things go up, things go down, panics come, panics go. I think you guys have done a sterling job. I have total faith and confidence that a couple of years from today, we'll be doing better than we did ever in our lives. That's my comment.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Rene. We greatly appreciate. We thank you for your confidence and loyalty, and we appreciate it very much. You've been a brilliant investor, and I remember when you started investing in HEICO, I think it was 1994, and you've done incredibly well through those ups and downs and those other panics. So thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: I think your comments are very wise, because you're right that the economy, the stock market sees these gyrations, and the one thing that is constant is HEICO's performance frankly because of our \u2013 the focus on our people and the great businesses we're in. So thank you very much and I think that's also particularly reassuring and makes our team members who are on this call feel good as well. So thank you very much.\nRene Plessner: You're very welcome. It's a pleasure to be friends and associates. I wish you good luck.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks a lot.\nRene Plessner: Okay, my friends. Take care. Bye.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Bye-bye.\nOperator: There are no further questions, please continue.\nLaurans Mendelson: Okay. If there are no more questions, I remind everyone on the call that we remain available to you by telephone or Zoom to answer questions, which you may have. And we look forward to speaking to you in some time now in December when we will have the year-end results announced. I thank you \u2013 we thank you for your participation and your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking to you soon again. That concludes our teleconference for the third quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, Peter. Good morning. I would say that the bad debt expense, even though it was kind of this one-time period-type cost that we don't like to see. It is something that's hard to control when airlines have bankruptcies. We probably had 20 airlines during the quarter declared reorganizations or Chapter 11. So our policies are to just basically write that stuff off, put a reserve up against it when we see that occurring. And if we get paid great, we hope to get paid, but nonetheless be conservative about it. Now as a result of that, and I talked about at the end of Q2, we have continued to really scrub our receivables and our customer base and make sure that credit that we're granting to our customers aligns with their financial strength in hopes that we \u2013 and continue to not extend ourselves in any one particular customer. So I think we've got \u2013 well, I can't predict whether there'll be more bankruptcies. I do believe that we have very conservative and very practical policies around receivables. And hopefully, ex this Chapter 11s, we won't see this type of charge in the future. Hey, Larry, thanks for the question. So my view on that topic is as follows. Most of the large domestic, whether it's U.S., Europe, China or wherever, they are getting some sort of government assistance and candidly these airlines are in many cases the pride of many of these countries. And so I feel like the ones that have been shaken out in Q3, candidly were some of the ones I was worried about at the end of Q2, and I brought that up on our conference call and played out. I don't think at the moment that I'm as concerned. One thing that we have done, as you just mentioned, is we did rationalize some of our credit exposure. We did a pretty deep study on that to make sure that we were appropriately supporting our customers, but that we weren't \u2013 they weren't using us as a bank candidly, and we won't do that going forward. We haven't in the past by the way. So as we're sitting here today, yes, I am obviously concerned about further bankruptcies, but at the moment, I feel like they've been supported either through additional debt, equity offerings or government assistance that I think will get them to the next point when traffic picks up, and we all move forward. So that's my view on it right now. Obviously, that could change, and a dime of things got worse, but we're not thinking that that will be the case right now. Thanks, Larry. Hey, Sheila, this is Carlos. So on the decrements, I think for Q3, we were around 37% for this segment. My view continues to be that our decrements resemble a component of fixed costs on our normal margins, which roughly 40%. I do think on the comeback. So as we continue to follow the industry and hopefully outpace the industry, I do think those decrements will shrink or the \u2013 I'm sorry, the add backs or the additional revenue will produce probably higher incremental margins than the decrements were, because we have leaned out in our Flight Support Group a little bit and we'll be piling back that volume on a lower cost basis. So I think that that will be very favorable. But in regards to our competitors, I don't know what competitors you're comparing us to, but I \u2013 just candidly, we \u2013 second quarter, we told folks that if we were down 50%, 60% of the segment, we'd break even. I think we did about what we thought we do. In fact, absent that bad debt charge, I was actually happy, not satisfied, but happy that we were able to produce an adjusted 11% margin and think that if we're looking forward, although we're not giving guidance, I don't expect \u2013 Eric, you can correct me on this if you believe, but I don't expect Q4 margins to be too much different. Thanks. One of the things, Ken that I would just comment on is that to Eric's point, we're still planning to put out 400 or 500 new parts this year, and that's the cadence that we believe the market can absorb. However, and Eric mentioned this earlier, we strongly believe that not a lot of these airlines are buying everything they can from us and where we're going to get I think the biggest bang, if you would, coming out of this is that these customers will lean into HEICO for these cost savings and look at our existing products that they're currently not buying and really dive into some of those. And I think that's on top of the new products that we introduced to the market, I do think that our existing product base has an opportunity to really expand coming out of this. [Ken] from our standpoint, we don't think that this is a permanent impairment to the industry. And so we're viewing this as quite temporary, and as a result, as Eric mentioned earlier, we've made what I'll call humane cuts and cost reductions and things like that with the eye toward the future. So I would say in the short-term, we're rolling to standby our employees, standby our team members, and keep the businesses intact to meet that expanded demand and so that's a short-term thing. If this was to become protractive and permanent, then, of course, we would do other things to our business to drive margins up and have our footprint match the demand. However, we think that demand right now is a dislocation and we're not willing to sacrifice customer service, new products and things like that just to meet a short-term quarterly hurdle on the margins. That's how we're looking at it. I don't think that that's going to change and I don't think the future has been enough at this point that we would make radical moves just to improve our margins in the short-term. As I think Eric mentioned earlier that he viewed the industry could be through the end of this year, where we see softness with a turn. I don't know \u2013 we're not here to predict when that happens. So please [indiscernible] into that. But our view are optimism is that by the end of this calendar year, we should start seeing some volumes and purchases for the sheer fact that these airlines have not been spending the money and they have been flying even though a lot of their fleets on the ground have been flying these planes, so we do expect just natural demand for those planes that are in air are going to kick up some time in the relatively short period. Good question. Surprised it took this long to get it. So look as you can imagine, when you're dealing with highly sophisticated electronics, highly sophisticated metals for aerospace and commercial aircraft, you have to put in orders for raw materials, well in advance. And so we're not immune. We're like everybody else. We had a lot of POs outstanding \u2013 non-cancelable POs outstanding going into this in March, where we had a lot of long lead time materials that we committed to. And look we got out of everything we could, but there are certain things that we were committed to we couldn't get out of. So really this quarter was affected by that. We had to take a fair amount of inventory that if we had our druthers, we might not have taken at this time. However, it's all consumable has long shelf life not things that will go bad on us. So from that perspective, I guess, it's an investment in our backlog and when volumes pick up we'll have it available, but that was the inventory jump. I mean that \u2013 when you peel the onion back that's the whole onion right there. More or less, yes. Sure. So the contracted assets and liabilities are a function of longer-term commitments by customers on HEICO to a project. So it's not like a build-it-and-ship-it arrangement. It's more where we have different revenue recognition [indiscernible] percent of complete and things like that.

So I don't know that you can draw much conclusions from that other than it's going to move north and south depending on how many deposits we get or how much deferred revenue we recognize versus how much progress we make on the WIP related to those particular projects. As far as working capital goes, I was very pleased with the collections for the quarter. AR was down, despite the fact that some of that was due to increasing the allowance. The majority of it was due to extraordinary efforts by our team members to collect on cash. And then, of course, you have lower revenues, which is going to contribute to lower AR balance also. In regards to our payables and our liabilities \u2013 accrued liabilities, within accruals, we're having \u2013 it's a kind of a reference point, we do have less accrued performance-based comp now than we did at the end of October 2019. So that \u2013 we are looking at it comparatively, that has an impact on the accruals, but I will also say that HEICO as a matter of policy have treated our vendors well during this period. We haven't strung them out. We haven't had a need to. And we believe by having those good business practices and not changing, we'll nerd our benefit on a go-forward basis. So that's why you might see a little bit of a decrease in those areas and payables outside of the timing aspects. Philosophically, that's how we think about it."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 4% to a record $638.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $615 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 1%. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower sales of our space, commercial aerospace and other electronics products, largely attributable to the outbreak, partially offset by increased sales of our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales decreased 2% to $210 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, from $216.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease is attributable to an organic net sales decrease of 6% partially offset by the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions. The organic net sales decrease is principally due to lower shipments of our defense and commercial aerospace products, mainly attributable to the outbreak, partially offset by increased sales of our space products in the third quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 2% to a record $184.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $181.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $61.9 million and $62.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, lower performance-based compensation expense and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales of certain space products and a less favorable product mix of certain aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales of certain defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, as compared to 29.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense and lower acquisition-related expenses. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 29.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 28.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense and a decrease in acquisition-related expenses partially offset by a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin is mainly due to a decrease in net sales and less favorable product mix of certain commercial aerospace and defense products partially offset by increased net sales and a more favorable product mix of certain space products in the quarter. Now I would like to turn the call back to our Chairman, Larry Mendelson. Thanks Rob. This is Victor. Maybe taking it a little bit in reverse order and thinking about the fourth quarter, which, of course, we're in right now, I'm not sure where things will wind up exactly within the fourth quarter. I could see us being up 5% or 10% just as easily as I could see us being down 5% or 10% in the fourth quarter, and that sort of gets into then the first part of your question and the kind of things that we're dealing with. And so, of course, commercial aviation that part of ETG is down, and it's comparable to what we're seeing within the Flight Support Group \u2013 in the commercial aviation businesses within the Flight Support Group. And I expect that to have a trajectory that will be comparable to what we experienced in the Flight Support Group. So the other part that has impacted some of the markets, the more general markets that we've talked about, that are serving the broader economy, some of the harsh environment markets have been slower and \u2013 or have slower demand, not dramatically, but you'll see 5% to 20% down in some product lines and things like that. So that's kind of the part of the business that's just a little bit slower. And then you get to the part that isn't slower, right, that has strong orders that remains healthy, which is the bulk of the business and that's in the defense and space side. And what we continue to see are disruptions that we talked about in the early part of the call that comes from \u2013 generally, it's supply chain side of it, but sometimes the customer side where, let's say, on the supply chain, it's deliveries, we'll have a supplier, which is experiencing their own outbreak issues in their plant, and they will have a line go down or something in there two weeks or four weeks later, something like that. We have it \u2013 and then they're late delivering to us, and then in turn that slows us down. And so you see things just kind of moving out nothing dramatic, but things can move out for a month or two weeks or something like that, and it shifts it from one quarter to the next. And then on the customer side, we will see the same kind of effect, where they will be closed or they will be at half staffing or something like that for two weeks or four weeks, and PO doesn't get out and the order doesn't get placed, and then we have decisions to make. Well, we know it's coming. Do we go ahead? Do we build ahead? And we generally don't take a lot of risk on building ahead and committing capital far in advance ourselves. We grapple with those decisions. We've got actually some government customers. I won't obviously name who they are, but you've got government customers who can't work online. They can't have their people working from home for security reasons, and they are at 30% or 50% staffing levels, and so they are delayed simply because they have people on these rotating shifts, and they're like one month on and one month off, it's just stuff like that. So no fundamental change. The demand is there, and it eventually gets placed. So we're very optimistic about those, and that's why I say it could just as easily be up 5% or 10% as down 5% or 10%. I don't think anything dramatic fortunately, and overall pretty, pretty healthy, but it makes it difficult to forecast, if you will, at the margins. Keep in mind one other thing when you look at the business, you look at the ETG for example, and you're talking about a business that's couple of hundred million-ish in a quarter, 1% is about $2 million, a little bit more, but that 1% is about $2 million. And you have a few businesses that shift by just a few hundred thousand dollars, and it moves from one quarter to the next, then you have a small number of businesses where that happens. It can have an effect where you have 1% or 2% or 3% of organic growth all of a sudden disappears and moves. Well, in space \u2013 when I talk about space, I'm really referring to the commercial space part of it. On the supply chain side, no, not so much because the issues that face people and companies are similar, and so if you have a space supplier who is delayed, and he can just easily the defense guy who is delayed. I mean, we all saw this on the F-35, right, that they're going to have a delay in testing them and simulation, right, last week. So on the supply side, it can be the same. It's just sort of a luck of the draw and commercial space, of course, as we've talked about in the prior calls that the shipments now are picking up to match the orders that we talked about, which had been accelerating and there has been an improvement on our commercial space side as we expected. Good morning. It's a good question, and I'm not trying to be cute or evasive. It's difficult to assess that now because of some of those disruptions I was talking about, where we have customers who are not there, sort of missing in action. And all of a sudden, they're there and placing big orders and hurrying up or asking us to rush because they were out for two weeks or a week or a month or something like that. So it's difficult to assess. On the defense demand and space, it feels robust. And when they show up \u2013 if they're not there, all of a sudden it's slow and then it picks up, it seems to make up very nicely, where it does seem to be lagging, as I said, are in some of those other markets that we serve. But then again, we'll see something \u2013 it'll have a feel of lagging, and then the customer shows up and says, okay, look, we really need to hurry up. Can you ship faster? And we have a bunch of orders. Is there anything you can do to trim the lead times? So I really hate to be evasive on this or to seem evasive, but I would prefer not to give you any percentage field at this point until we've got some better clarity, which I'm hoping maybe in three or six months, we will and have a better sense. Got it. No, I don't think they've in-sourced. I think that there hasn't been much change. If anything, it's probably going to be greater outsourcing due to the people cuts that they've been forced to make. So I think our component repair people are very wired in and are very optimistic on a number of really good opportunities. Larry, this is Victor. And keep in mind, we're not buying and we're not trying to be commodity transactors. We are working with people who care about their businesses and care about what they've created and care about their people. So this is not just like they're selling a piece of land or a building or something and they're agnostic, it's what transpires post closing. They really want a good home for the business. And that is as much a part of this. It's not just about finding a price and moving on, although obviously price is important. I mean they're selling to have some security and liquidity and other things. So that's all part of the consideration that goes into it for us. And I think that's very much what distinguishes us. And if you look at the transactions, the acquisitions we made recently, one of them was a company we've been talking with for four years and getting to know for four years. And they were not for sale. They were not in a process at all. They had no investment banker and it was just our typical type of transaction. The other two companies, one of them was not for sale either, and as part of the process of buying the first either the two related companies, which was kind of going through a process, which they truncated for us because of the relationships they had with one of our other companies and other people they knew at one of our other companies, and they said, these are the people we want to sell our business to. And then in the discussions, the business that was related to that, we sort of convinced them that we'd like to put it all together and do something exciting together. That was part of that, and I think we get an advantage out of it. But one thing we won't do by the way is, we're not going to do a deal just for the sake of doing a deal. We're not going to force a bad deal because we own forever. And we don't look to sell. It's not like private equity or we're not just stacking in on like some sort of Ponzi scheme, where \u2013 we'll get some growth this year and who cares what happens next year, it's got to work forever. Well, I was just going to say it was more than two deals this year, that I was just going to correct, and it's four. Yes. I wasn't sure I understood. The question was inorganic growth Louis? Of course, it's late in the year and the Transformational and Intelligent and Connect Tech we just closed, and so they're closed late in the year, and we don't have guidance right for this year, and we're not giving guidance. So unfortunately I can't give anything beyond what we've made public already about the companies other than to say they are sort of typical kinds of transactions that are the entrepreneurial businesses that fit the profile of the kind of companies we buy. They are the typical kind of singles and doubles that we refer to. They're not the swing for the fences kinds of companies that are going to remake HEICO in their entirety. But they're just very nice additive acquisitions, and I think we're just \u2013 we're very happy to have them, but unfortunately I can't give a lot more detail, but I will caution to say I wouldn't go out, for example, and double your earnings estimate of HEICO from these acquisitions. Don't get too aggressive from these. Trying to be helpful that way, don't get too aggressive. Well, I'll let Eric talk about some that he has seen. There were \u2013 there was an acquisition that we were working on, that was looking promising. But as we dug in, in the due diligence, it turned out to be, well, a great company. We felt that it wouldn't hold the long-term promise that we thought. Initially it will be great for a couple of years, maybe two, three years, and then would really start to trend in the wrong direction, and that we couldn't really reverse that. So that was one that, early this year I thought was much more likely to happen. And by the way, that's not unusual unless \u2013 it's unfortunately part of what happens, and that's why I made that comment earlier when Larry Solow asked the question about acquisitions that we own forever, and we are really very careful because, obviously, every dollar HEICO invests, we look at it as our own money and do it right. Now, Eric can talk a little about some of the things that he has been working..."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and thank you and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and welcome you to the HEICO Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members who have performed admirably during the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak. Their dedication to HEICO's customers and the safety of their fellow team members has been exemplary. I want each and every member of HEICO's global team to understand that the Board of Directors and I are humbled by your dedication and continued focus on safety and wellbeing during these challenging times. I am confident that our future is bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period as a stronger and more competitive company. At this time, I will take a few minutes to discuss the impact on HEICO's operating results from the outbreak for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2020. The effects of the outbreak and the related actions by governments around the world to mitigate its spread have impacted our employees, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers. In response to the economic impact from the outbreak, we at HEICO have implemented certain cost reduction efforts, including layoffs, temporary reduced work hours, temporary pay reductions within various departments of our business, including within our entire executive management team as well as our Board of Directors. Our response to the outbreak included implementing varying health and safety measures at our facilities, including supplying and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, staggering work shifts, body temperature taking, increasing work-from-home capabilities, consistent and ongoing cleaning of workspaces and high-touch areas, and establishing processes aligned with the Centers for Disease and Control guidelines to work with any individual exposed to COVID-19 on their necessary quarantine period, and the process for the individual to return to work. With respect to the results of operations, approximately half of our net sales are derived from defense, space, and other industrial markets, including electronics, medical, and telecommunications. Demand for products in that half of our business has not been fundamentally impacted and its operational results remain materially consistent with the financial expectations prior to the outbreak. We have experienced and expect to continue experiencing periodic operational disruptions resulting from supply chain disturbances, staffing challenges, including at some of our customers, temporary facility closures, transportation interruptions, and other conditions, which [indiscernible] or increased cost. While these issues have not yet been material overall, we have experienced disruption in some orders and some shipments during the third quarter. The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services. The outbreak has caused significant volatility and a substantial decline in the value across global markets. Most notably, the commercial aerospace industry experienced an ongoing substantial decline in demand resulting from a significant number of aircraft in the global fleet being grounded during our third quarter. Our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry have been materially impacted by the significant decline in global commercial air travel that began in March of this year. Consolidated net sales for our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry decreased by approximately 54% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. As I previously mentioned, we have taken responsible measures to address these reductions in net sales at our affected businesses. Once commercial air travel resumes, cost savings most likely will be a priority for commercial aviation customers, and we anticipate recovery in demand for our commercial aviation products, which frequently provides aircraft operators with significant cost savings. One item that I'd like to point out that we have been asked on calls between last night and this morning, a number of people asked for the dollar amount of account receivable reserves that we set up for the bankruptcy of some small airlines, and that number, the absolute number was $7.5 million. Later on in this call, Carlos can give you more details on how it affects the operating margins and so forth, but the absolute number was $7.5 million. Keep in mind that historically we have been able to make up and possibly collect some of that $7.5 million. At this point, we don't know how much that might be, if any. So we have, as normally do, taken the most conservative approach and reserved the whole amount that could go bad. We believe that our cost savings solutions and robust product development programs will enable us to potentially increase market share and emerge with a stronger presence within the commercial aviation market. Summarizing the highlights of the third quarter, consolidated net income increased 4% to a record $251.7 million or $1.83 per diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $242.2 million or $1.76 per diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $299 million and $313.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $93.1 million or 171% of net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $135.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and equivalents, of $344.8 million compared to shareholders' equity improved to 17.7% as of July 30, down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.7x, less than 1x as of July 31, 2020, and that was down from 0.93x as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we have successfully completed six acquisitions, four of which were completed since the outbreak start. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023, and we plan to utilize our financial flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. I do want to point out that unlike some companies in the aerospace industry, HEICO did not have to go to the market to raise money at what I consider exorbitant rates of 8% or more. So we just went through this financially sound and I think that has really helped us and has proven to be an excellent strategy. In July 2020, we paid the regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, and that represented our 84th consecutive semiannual cash dividend. We did not have to cut the dividend and we were very proud of that. Some companies did cut dividend significantly because of cash flow pressures, we did not. In July 2020, we reported that our Sierra Microwave, VPT, 3D-Plus subsidiaries supplied mission-critical hardware for the Mars 2020/Perseverance mission. The Mars mission is designed to better understand the geology of Mars and seek signs of ancient life by collecting and storing rocks, soil samples for a future return to Earth, while also testing new technology for robotic and human space exploration. We congratulate the many remarkable people who accomplished this first step in this incredible mission, and we are proud of the HEICO companies and team members who contributed to the effort and we are excited for the mission's next stage. Talking about acquisitions, in June 2020, we acquired 70% of the membership interest of Rocky Mountain Hydrostatics, which overhauls industrial pumps, motors, and other hydraulic units, with a focus on the support of legacy systems for the U.S. Navy. The remaining 30% continues to be owned by certain members of Rocky Mountain's management team. And Rocky Mountain is part of our Flight Support Group, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In August 2020, we acquired 75% of the equity interest of Intelligent Devices and Transformational Security. These two companies design and develop and manufacture state-of-the-art technical surveillance countermeasures equipment used to protect critical spaces from exploitation via wireless transmissions, technical surveillance, and listening devices. In summary, I'll say basically spying by unwanted people. These acquisitions are part of Electronic Technologies, and we expect them to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. The remaining 25% interest was acquired by the non-controlling interest holders of a subsidiary in HEICO Electronic that is also a designer and manufacturer of the same type of equipment used basically for different applications. In August 2020, we acquired 90% of the equity interest of Connect Tech. Connect Tech designs, manufactures rugged, small form factor embedded computing solutions. Its components are designed for very harsh environments and primarily used in rugged commercial and industrial, aerospace and defense, transportation, and smart energy applications. The remaining 10% interest continues to be owned by a member of Connect Tech's management team. This acquisition is part of the Electronic Technologies Group, and we expect it to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor and Eric. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 32% to $0.40 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $0.59 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group, partially offset by lower income tax expense, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest and lower interest expense. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 4% to $1.83 in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $1.76 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. And that increase principally reflects an incremental discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises, which we recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest and lower interest expense, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, that was up slightly from $21.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and totaled $65.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, up from $61.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. R&D expense was $15.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $16.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and it increased 1% to $49 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $48.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Significant new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and Flight Support, and we continue to invest more than 3% of each sales dollar into new product development. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 20% to $75 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, down from $93.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 13% to $232.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $267.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects a concerted effort by both Flight Support and ETG to control their SG&A spend. And these efforts resulted in lower G&A expenses such as a decrease in performance-based compensation expense and a reduction in various selling expense, including outside sales commissions, marketing and travel. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense at Flight Support, which I previously mentioned was $7.5 million, due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result of the financial impact of the outbreak as well as the increase from fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 17.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the after mentioned increase in bad debt expenses due to bankruptcy filings made by certain commercial aviation customers and higher other SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales due to decreased sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percent of net sales decreased to 17.1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, down from 17.7% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is mainly due to again, lower performance-based compensation expenses, partially offset by an increase in other SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and an increase in the bad debt expense, reflecting the previously mentioned bankruptcy filings. Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 down from $5.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and decreased to $10.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020, and that was down from $16.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 was principally due to a lower weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 13.4% compared to 22% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects a larger deduction related to foreign-derived intangible income, principally resulting from final tax regulations that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017 as well as a larger income tax credit for qualified R&D activities. Our effective tax rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was 3.5% compared to 17.1% in the first nine months of 2019. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, which accounted for a majority of the decrease in our year-to-date effective rate. The decrease in the effective rate in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 also reflects a larger deduction related to the previously mentioned foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as larger income tax credits for qualified R&D activities. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $3.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $16.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to $25 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the impact of the dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 19, 2019, that effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries back to the Flight Support Group and a decrease in operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interests are held. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain extremely strong. As we mentioned earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities was consistently strong at $299 million and $313.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $93.1 million or 171% of net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $135.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our working capital ratio improved to 5x as of July 31, 2020 compared to 2.8x as of October 31, 2019. Our day sales outstanding, DSOs, of receivables improved to 43 days as of July 31, 2020 and that compared to 45 days as of July 31, 2019. We monitor all receivable collection efforts and try to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales, and our top-five customers represented 25% and 21% of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Inventory turnover increased to 154 days for the period ended July 31, 2020 and that compared to 125 days for the period ended July 31, 2019. The increase in the turnover rate principally reflect certain long-term and non-cancelable inventory purchase commitments based on pre-outbreak net sales expectations and also the necessity to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now looking forward, the outlook. We cannot estimate the outbreaks duration and magnitude, and we cannot confidently predict when demand for commercial aerospace products will return to pre-outbreak levels. However, we do continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. We entered the outbreak with a healthy balance sheet that included a strong cash position and nominal debt. We believe HEICO is favorably positioned for long-term success despite the short-term challenges created by the outbreak in the global economy. This COVID pandemic will not last forever. Our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring an operating high cash generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aviation such as defense, space and other high-end markets, including electronic and medicals puts us in a good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. I would like to end my remarks by again thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team is focused on your safety and professional success. We will exit this outbreak stronger than before, and that strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, mutual respect for one another, the unwavering pursuit of exceeding customers' expectations. And we thank you all for all that you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. And I would like to add, I also thank our loyal shareholders who have stuck by HEICO and sent us many, many positive comments and thanks, and we truly appreciate your interest and support. And now I would like to open the floor for questions. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. Thank you, Rob. Thank you for the questions. Good morning, Peter. Pete, this is Larry. We see a lot of books coming across our desk. We think the motivation are probably twofold. One, some companies feel under pressure. They've seen their markets shrink and so forth, and they would like to have a strong financial partner. So that's one thing. The other thing is that the talk of a Biden win, increase of capital gain tax to 43.5% or something like that is really scaring the hell out of a lot of people and including me. And I must tell you that we are seeing more books than we can handle. And also, because of the logistics of doing due diligence and you know, we do a very thorough due diligence in-house. It takes longer because you can't go out, you can't access the facilities and so forth, but I would say that the M&A pipeline is really very, very strong. And I also think that we're seeing much more reasonable pricing. And I think that we will over the next six, 12 months have some very excellent opportunities. Good morning. We're an opportunistic acquirer. In the M&A field, we really manage our cash. And I think that's one of the secrets to our success. We don't put out money unless we get a return on those funds and they pay for themselves. So it's not size that gives us bottom line earnings and cash flow. If we have a good opportunity with a great seller or an operator, we'll take advantage of it. We also, as you know, use the policy of having sellers retain a percentage to keep them interested and involved, and that's been a very successful formula. Now as far as the size of the trend, we do look at larger transactions and we consider them. Would we like to do a larger transaction? Yes, as long as it meets the standards that we set. We're not going to do a big transaction and dilute everything and dilute cash flow and build up debt and so forth without getting a strong return, which we like to get. So we have been successful in compound \u2013 remember, our goal is compounding our bottom line at 15% to 20%. So we will make acquisitions and internal organic growth to meet that goal. And if a large acquisition is available, we'll do it. And if we have to go smaller bolt-ons that really generate cash, we'll do it. Just as an example, the companies that we buy, we check based upon their historical performance, cash flow and everything, normally paid for themselves in seven to 10 years. By the time we get to the third or fourth year on a look-back, what we have invested, the initial investment less what we have taken out of the company or the companies produce cash for us, we probably have them sitting in our portfolio at anywhere from 2x to 4x EBITDA. So I mean they're producing more cash annually than \u2013 I mean it's amazing. That is why you get the results that you get or we get the results that we get. So to me and to us and our team, it's all about the cash flow return. And that is more important than the earnings per share. Although, we know if we have cash flow, we will have earnings per share. We can have earnings per share, but no cash flow, as you very well know. So that's what we will continue to focus on that strategy. I hope that's answered your \u2013 Gautam, does that answer your question? Thank you. Good morning, Larry. I don't think so, Larry. I think we're looking at them in the same way. As you know, we don't want to pay for a hockey stick. And most deals \u2013 and as you well know, the investment banker shows you a hockey stick and he tells you next year and the year is going to be greater, so therefore, pay for it upfront. We normally don't buy into that unless we can feel comfortable in due diligence that they really have the orders on the books and so forth and so on. So the COVID, we are trying to structure deals where we pay for what we get on a current basis and then offer the seller earn-outs or partnerships so the seller can really have his cake and eat it, too. They can secure a down payment as a percentage of the total, and then over the next three, four, five, six years, they can make up the difference if in fact the company earns it. So this kind of protects us on the downside and it protects the seller on the upside. Obviously, that structure appeals to a lot of people. And we think and they think it's a very fair structure. Thanks, Larry. Good morning, Josh. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks Mike. Also, I'd like to point out something, I don't know if it came through clearly, but in my remarks I mentioned that we bought 75% of the company call intelligent devices and Transformational Security. We call it TSCM. And that company that we acquired was a direct result of an introduction by another company that we acquired about a year-ago, and these two companies are very compatible in what they manufacture. Different markets, slightly different \u2013 and different products but accomplish similar objectives to the customer. Now many of our acquisitions are as a result of our subsidiary operations getting to know either a supplier, a competitor, or somebody in the industry over a long period of time developing strong relationships, so when we buy a company, we have a pretty good idea of the level of confidence that we will have in the future of owning that company. So we don't shoot in the dark. And again, our strategy, as I mentioned, is bottom line cash flow. And in this particular case, we think we may get some synergies in marketing and may be manufacturing and other things. Those strategies really don't show up in press releases and so forth, but we've made about 78 acquisitions. Carlos, how many \u2013 78? 78 acquisitions. And I think you know we've never had a bust, we've never had a company that said, boom, it's no good. So some are better than others, some are little less than we expected, but we have never had a disaster where we had to say, oh, my God, we just made a terrible mistake. So that is our strategy. And I think from an acquisition point of view, it's worked for us. And that's how we've been able to compound our bottom line by about 19% over 30 years and we continue to focus on that. We are not interested in being the biggest company in the world, we want to be a very profitable company, and by that I mean cash flow, one and earnings per share, two. Thank you, Rene. We greatly appreciate. We thank you for your confidence and loyalty, and we appreciate it very much. You've been a brilliant investor, and I remember when you started investing in HEICO, I think it was 1994, and you've done incredibly well through those ups and downs and those other panics. So thank you very much. Bye-bye. Okay. If there are no more questions, I remind everyone on the call that we remain available to you by telephone or Zoom to answer questions, which you may have. And we look forward to speaking to you in some time now in December when we will have the year-end results announced. I thank you \u2013 we thank you for your participation and your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking to you soon again. That concludes our teleconference for the third quarter. Thank you."

The Fight Support Group's net sales were $731.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to $915.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Fight Support Group's net sales were $178.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $320 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The net sales decrease in the first nine months in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 is principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines, resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020 due to the outbreak. Net sales in fiscal 2020 follows a very strong 12% and 13% organic growth reported in the third quarter and full fiscal 2019 year respectively. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $121.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to $179.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $64.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreased in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales, a lower gross profit margin, mainly within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines, and an increase in bad debt expense, principally due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as a result of the financial impact of the outbreak. These decreases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 16.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to 19.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the first nine months and third quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the impact of the outbreak and previously mentioned higher bad debt expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Sure, Rob. Let me start with the trend. We were \u2013 back in May, when we said we were hopeful that May would mark the bottom, in fact, May was the bottom, and we were able to bounce nicely off of the May numbers into June and July. And I would say they were sort of consistent in that level. In terms of reviewing the businesses within the parts side, of course, we've got the PMA and we've got the distribution, and I would say that they were down sort of in the similar area. Repair was down a little bit more and that was to be expected as airlines we anticipated would reduce whatever expenditures that they saw. Specialty products, I would say, was down a little less in the beginning of the pandemic, but I think now as people recognize that the build rate is going to be reduced, I think the suppliers to the OEMs, including the HEICO businesses that do that are going to be impacted sort of longer than the aftermarket is going to be impacted. I reviewed with our sales executives the customer sales and how we're doing by product lines and by customers and it's sort of interesting to note that while the business is down, the percentage that we reported, there are certain airlines that are down very significantly, I would say, 96%, 90%, 88%, 87%, and these are major customers. I don't want to mention their names and I don't want to mention their geographies, but I can tell you that these are major airlines that are not going to be able to operate. I mean, they're operating 30% to 50% of their flights and yet their purchases are down in the 90s. And obviously, that is not a sustainable model. I think that they \u2013 our people believe that they entered the crisis with lean inventories and my sense is that they are \u2013 they've used up or they're using up whatever they've got. And this is not going to last indefinitely. So to answer your question, I think that the OEM market will be down longer for the new build and for the reasons that airlines don't need the aircraft, but I do believe that the aftermarket will start to snap back. July did improve from June, but I would be careful to sort of extrapolate that improvement going forward because as we've seen with the sort of the late July increase in infection rate, of course, that's now come down, I mean, that would, obviously, sort of put a damper on the increases going forward. So I think very much it's going to be related to the infection rates into the progress on a therapeutic as well as a vaccine. But the one thing which I am extraordinarily hopeful of and very, very positive on is, when I met with our salespeople, who are probably on this call, and we reviewed the customers in detail, I gave them every opportunity to tell me why the future would be tough and why I should \u2013 why things maybe difficult coming out and sort of for them to set expectations low. And I can tell you that to a person they were extraordinarily optimistic. They think that \u2013 and they gave me specifics as to why HEICO has increased its credibility with the customers that were a significant aviation, a company now, if you look at our market cap versus other companies, and they believe that we're going to come out of this significantly stronger than we've come out of any of the other prior crises, and they gave me the specifics, which I don't want to mention for competitive reasons on this call, but I believe that we're going to be in a very strong shape to come out. So I guess, what you're getting to is, when do we think things will get better? Of course, we don't know, but the one thing we are 100% certain of is they will get better and we will emerge definitely stronger than we've ever been. Yes. I mean, as you know, we are hesitant to talk about specific regions or customers. We pretty much deal with everybody. So it's not so much getting new customers for us as it is selling customers more of our product line. And I'm very optimistic that we are going to be selling. I've seen a lot of specifics on customers interested in and working on improving product that they had not in the past. Our time has come. There is no reason that if somebody is buying X percent of our product line, they shouldn't be buying the entire product line. And we've got, I believe, the best people in the field. One of the reasons why our results and margins were better than expected, but lower than we would have liked is because while there was a lot of shared sacrifice in terms of furloughs and reduced hours and reduced pay, we've done everything we could and we can to keep our people, whether it's the new product development folks or the sales folks, quality, purchasing, everything to keep our people on our payroll because we believe that we're going to come out this extremely strong, and we don't want to be caught flatfooted. We've got a number of peers in the industry, who I believe were very aggressive with their reductions, and I think that is going to hamper them coming out, whereas HEICO has continued to maintain that infrastructure. Good morning. Good morning, Peter, and thanks for your question. So if you add back the bad debt reserves that we had in the third quarter, the Flight Support Group's operating margin was around 11%, the adjusted operating margin. And of course, we had no way of knowing the impact of what these bad debt charges would be when we originally said at the end of our second quarter call that the Flight Support Group would operate in the breakeven area with sales down 50% to 60%. So I think we did, sales-wise, much better than we expected as well as margins much better than we expected. And going forward, it really depends on the slope of the recovery. We're very optimistic that we will recover and we're going to come back much stronger than when we went in. But the period of time that it's going to take for that recovery is difficult at this point. But I would say probably somewhat comparable, if I were to guess, to the third quarter. Correct. And Carlos, I think, has something to add here. And Peter, this is Eric. Also, I want to add that due to our capital structure and the culture at HEICO of valuing our team members because, frankly, they're the ones who make the company. When times are tough like this, we stick by our people, we stick by our programs. We're not highly levered. We don't swing around and cut very deeply. So as a result, I think when sellers look at HEICO, our businesses go through various cycles, but they want to be connected with somebody who is going to be patient and work with them, and frankly, not kill them and run them out the door the first time there's a downturn. And I think when you look at HEICO, you see that that's the case and that's something that we try to articulate. And I think is one of the reasons why we continue to be the acquirer of choice. We're very busy flying around, meeting with management teams with entrepreneurs and very, very much focused on continuing to make acquisitions and use our way under levered balance sheet. Thanks. This is Eric, Gautam. No, I would say since it's really outside of our \u2013 it's not included in our third quarter, we'd rather not comment on it. However, I think it's reasonable to expect \u2013 if you look at the general \u2013 as I mentioned before, if you look at the general sort of infection rate trend, what's going on in the economy. I think it's logical to assume that things are a little flattish right now, but I think people are optimistic that it will recover. So the only question is exactly when that recovery occurs. Yes. Unequivocally, yes. There has been a lot more interest, definitely. With airlines under the gun, having to show reduced cost for the same, if not improved performance, absolutely. And that's what gives me so much confidence for the future. Remember one thing, Gautam, and we said this historically quite often, we are very customer focused. And if our customers are struggling, not there or whatever, we're not going to put something in the mail and send it to them and say tough. We want to make sure that we're easy to do business with, and then our customers respect our flexibility. And our structure is uniquely done in a way that it can handle that ad hoc. We're not one big monolithic organization. We have multiple subsidiaries all over the place, and they're close with their customers and they monitor and deal with this. And I think what that will do for us going forward and into the future is that we'll endure even more to our customer base and will allow us to move forward with an even stronger position with all of these customers. So I agree with Victor. We can't really give a percentage because we're not so focused on that. But what I do know is that our customers appreciate the way we're handling this right now. And I think that's going to pay dividends for us in the future. Yes. Hi. Larry, I would say that is pretty much, correct. With the exception that I mentioned earlier in the call that a number of our customers are operating down in the 90% area and that is just not sustainable. And these guys are flying aircraft and it is just impossible for them to not purchase the parts. So I do think that we could have a \u2013 we may do better than that, and I think naturally as they run out of inventory. So I guess the short answer to your question is, even if things stay where they are, I would expect a rebound, because they've drawn out the inventory. Yes, it's going to come back quicker. But definitely the number of flights is something that we watch very closely, but they can't continue operating at the levels that they are at. Yes. Hi. It's a good question Josh, and it's something which I think about quite a bit. I think that it could start later this year. I just don't see how these airlines can continue operating with the low level of purchases that they've had. So my thought is that it could be quickly, but certainly in 2021. I would say that, in general, everybody went into the downturn with much lower inventories than they had in the prior downturns, whether it was the global financial crisis in 2008, 2009 or the U.S. carriers when 9/11 happened, the international carriers with SARS, they went in with much leaner inventories. So I anticipate the snap back to be quicker than perhaps it has in the past. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. Good morning, Sheila. Yes, part of that of course is our defense exposure, which has mitigated the impact. The other portion to a lesser extent was really our specialty products, which is primarily OEM related. Now I do anticipate the OEM-related products to be down sort of longer because we expect the new build rates are going to be down. But I think this points to the importance of the HEICO products out there. We offer great cost savings. We're very aggressive on developing new products. We've got a lot of stuff in the pipeline. And I think that we're going to be a very key part of our customers' recovery plans. HEICO is well capitalized. We kept our sales people out in the field. We didn't do like other companies where they really slammed cost and got rid of engineering. I mean we've kept all that. So I think that that's really helping us at this time. We are. We're out there with all other airlines. We want to give them as much attention as they will tolerate from us. So we're always out there trying to develop additional customers. And as I mentioned in one of the questions earlier, there is no reason if somebody is buying X percent of our product line that they don't increase and buy all of our product line. And frankly, this is the communication effort that we engage in daily. And I think it's taking hold and that's why our people are very optimistic on our recovery here and why we're going to play a greater role in our customers' fleet plans. When we came out of the financial crisis, I don't know \u2013 I don't recall what HEICO's market cap was at that time, but it's a fraction of what it is today. And today, when we're out there competing with other suppliers, HEICO has got a much larger market cap than they do, and we have a tremendous amount of credibility, and there is no reason why the airlines shouldn't be increasing their exposure with us, especially since we kept up with them during the down cycle, we kept our people, we kept the new product development, we kept shipping them. There were a lot of suppliers who cut off the financially stressed customers. And while we were careful to manage and only ship them what they needed, we helped keep them in business. So I think that that's going to help us. And while all this roughly $8 million bad debt hit really stinks I think that it plants the seeds for very strong customer relationships going forward. Correct. I agree with you. I agree with you. Thanks. Good morning, Ken. Yeah. I think we're going to do better than the industry. I think that our cost saving products are going to very much be needed. People are trusting us more. So I anticipate that we're going to come out stronger than the industry. It's a tough number to look at, because when we compare it to \u2013 there are many things to compare it to, ASMs, number of flights, revenue passenger miles, aftermarket sales performance of our peers. So I think, no matter what you look at, we're going to outperform it, and sort of the multiple depends on where we are at that moment in time. And remember, one of the things that we typically don't have is the initial provisioning, and that can of course skew the numbers one way or the other. So we don't benefit from that initial provision in general. So ours is really just straight aftermarket usage of parts. Well, we've kept up our new product development. I think whereas many of our peers have slashed new product development, we have not. And that, of course, weighed on our margins. We also did what we could to retain our people, and I think our cuts were significantly less than our peers. So I anticipate that we're going to come out stronger. In terms of number of products, I think it's going to be similar to what we've done in the past. Probably as a percentage of sales, R&D cost is going up because sales have gone down. So \u2013 but we continue to be very bullish. Thanks, Ken. Yes. Mike, it's so hard to pick what the numbers are. I mean, frankly, we thought the third quarter \u2013 I went back and I looked at our internal forecast in May as to what we thought the third quarter would be, and we significantly outperformed that. So it's very hard to guess. The snap backs come when nobody is expecting them, and boom, they just all of a sudden come and then things flatline for a while and then I think they come again. But I do think that people are just itching to get out, and they're being careful getting more comfortable with social distancing, wearing masks and non-aircraft and that sort of thing. But it's just hard to predict exactly when. But I promise you one thing. We're going to be ready for them. No, I think the companies that have had the airlines that have had to reorganize, I think they had very little inventory. And we work with them to keep them flying to help them out, but I think they had very little inventory. I don't anticipate there being an impact based on that. I believe so. And I think we're going to have a little bit of that, Mike, but not to the levels we had this quarter. Thank you. Good. How are you, Louis? I'm sorry... Yes, got you. So let me hit the net debt question then Victor can talk a little bit about the acquisitions. Coming out of the quarter, we had close to $400 million on the balance sheet. So the impact on net debt is really zero, right, because I used cash to pay for these things. So the impact on our net debt is not going to be anything. So we're okay in that standpoint. Victor, if you want to address? Yes. We have seen some deals pause because the future is very uncertain for certain companies, and also we've seen there were a number of deals we had worked on where frankly private equity offered a significantly higher price unless the companies at the altar. And so I mean this is a danger with private equity, and I think some of those could come back around for us as well. Yes. So we do defense throughout all of the three sub-reporting groups within FSG. Specialty products is both commercial as well as defense. So it does both. I would say, percentage wise, it would be higher in specialty products, but I need to look at those specific numbers, because \u2013 how it's all reported, but I wouldn't draw a big distinction on that though. Thank you. Yes, Colin. It's a great question, and it is something that we are focused on. And we do have a unique value proposition in that when we do repair. We can offer our proprietary repairs as well as the use of our proprietary parts. So it's up to the customer. If they want the OEM material, we're happy to go ahead and do that, and if they want our material, we're happy to go ahead and sell that as well. But there definitely is close cooperation between our various lines of businesses while they do operate independently for reporting purposes, and so people can really own their businesses, they do cooperate. And there is a lot of that cross selling, and that's one of the reasons why I'm very optimistic about the future and about the way we're going to come out of this. Yes, we have increased the cooperation. We are focused on that, absolutely, and that's something that as we continue to broaden the product offerings in each of our businesses, we've got this areas where they can help other businesses and they're very, very much focused on that, absolutely. Great. Thank you, Colin. I think your comments are very wise, because you're right that the economy, the stock market sees these gyrations, and the one thing that is constant is HEICO's performance frankly because of our \u2013 the focus on our people and the great businesses we're in. So thank you very much and I think that's also particularly reassuring and makes our team members who are on this call feel good as well. So thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Thank you."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Laurans Mendelson, HEICO Chairman and Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. \nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call, and we thank you for joining us. Welcome you to the HEICO second quarter fiscal '20 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Before reviewing our second quarter operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members. You have responded with distinction to the unprecedented challenge of serving our customers and your local communities during the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic. I am humbled by your collective actions and unwavering commitment to HEICO's success. I strongly believe your contributions to HEICO's entrepreneurial values and ownership culture will continue to produce a winning formula in the marketplace despite the near-term challenges that we face as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. I'll now take a few moments to discuss our second quarter operating results. The results of operations for the six and three months ended April 30, 2020 have been affected by COVID-19. The effects of the outbreak and related actions by governments around the world to mitigate its spread have impacted our team members, customers, suppliers and manufacturers. In response to the economic impact from the outbreak, we, at HEICO, have implemented certain cost reductions including layoffs, temporary reduced work hours, temporary pay reductions within various departments of our businesses, including our entire executive management team and our Board of Directors. Our response to the outbreak, including implementing varying health and safety measures at our facilities, including supplying and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, staggering work shifts, body temperature taking, increasing work from home capabilities, consistent and ongoing cleaning of workspaces in high-touch areas and establishing processes aligned with the Center for Disease and Control guidelines to work with any individual exposed to COVID-19 on the necessary quarantine period and the process for the individual to return to work. With respect to our results of operations, approximately half of our net sales are derived from defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics, medical and communications. Demand for products in that half of our business has not been fundamentally impacted, and its operational results remained materially consistent with the financial expectations prior to the outbreak. However, we have experienced, expect to continue experiencing, periodic operational disruptions resulting from supply chain disturbances, staffing challenges, including some of our customers, temporary facility closures, transportation interruptions and other conditions, which slow production or may increase cost. While these issues have not yet been material, it is possible to predict their future impact -- it is impossible to predict their future impact, and our current experience indicates that the likely effect will be to delay orders and shipments measured in weeks and months and to temporarily increase some costs and this as opposed to profoundly changing our business overall. Fortunately, many of our defense and medical component design, manufacturing and supply operations are believed to be crucial suppliers to markets with continuing strong needs, while it has not had a material impact on consolidated net sales, demand for our components used in medical equipment, such as ventilators, x-ray systems, sterilization equipment, personal protective equipment all increased as a result of the outbreak. The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services. The outbreak has caused significant volatility and substantial decline in value across global economic markets. Most notably, the commercial aerospace industry has experienced an ongoing substantial decline in demand. As such, our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry have been materially impacted by the significant decline in global commercial air travel that began in March 2020. Once commercial air travel resumes, cost savings will most likely be a priority for our commercial aviation customers. And we do anticipate recovery in demand for our commercial aviation products, which frequently provide aircraft operators with significant cost savings. Furthermore, we believe that our cost-saving solutions and robust product development programs will enable us to potentially increase market share and emerge with a stronger presence within this market. Consolidated net income increased 22% to a record $197.3 million, or $1.44 per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $161.1 million, or $1.18 per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Consolidated operating income increased 1% to $219.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $217.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Our consolidated operating margin improved to 22.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from 22.1% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Cash flow provided by operating activities was strong increasing 15% to $205.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $178.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $393.4 million as of April 30, compared to shareholders' equity ratio decreased to 20.8% as of April 30, 2020, and that was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Net debt to EBITDA ratio decreased to 0.72 times as of April 30, 2020 and that was down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we successfully completed two acquisitions and we have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales decreased 18% to $252 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $308.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's net sales decreased 7% to $553.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, as compared to $595.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The net sales decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 is principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020 due to the outbreak. The Flight Support Group's operating income decreased 24% to $47.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $62.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating income decreased 5% to $109.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, as compared to $115 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales and a lower gross profit margin mainly within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts in products -- service product lines partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin decreased to 18.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 20.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned lower performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 19.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from 19.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from lower performance based compensation expense partially offset by the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the Electronic Technologies Group results.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 2% to $219 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $214.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 2%. The organic net sales decrease is mainly attributable to lower space product shipments partially offset by increased demand for our space products. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 7% to a record $427.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from $398.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, as well as 2% organic growth mainly due to increased demand for our defense products partially offset by lower space product shipments. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income decreased 3% to $65.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $67.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin mainly due to a decrease in net sales of our space and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales of our defense products as well as the previously mentioned net sales growth and lower performance-based compensation expense. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 3% to a record $123 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from $119 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and lower performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly due to a decrease in net sales of our space and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales in our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to 29.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 is mainly due to the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense. Let me turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 8% to $0.55 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 22% to $1.44 in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $1.18 in the first six months of fiscal 2019. That increase principally reflects an incremental discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $20.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and totaled $43.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up slightly from $40.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Research and development expense was $16.8 million in both the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and increased 6% to $33.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $32 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies as we continue to invest between -- of each sales dollar into new product development. Our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased by 22% to 20 points -- to $70 million [ph] in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $90.2 million second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased by 10% to $157.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $174.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance-based compensation expense and reductions in expenses including outside sales, commissions, marketing and travel, partially offset by the impact from the fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was down from 17.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. That decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance-based compensation expense partially offset by some inefficiencies resulting from the overall impacts of the outbreak. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was down from 17.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance based compensation expenses. Interest expense decreased to $3.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was down from $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. And it decreased to $8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 down from $11 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 was principally due to a lower weighted interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the second quarter in six -- first six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019 was not significant. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 22.6% as compared to 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our effective tax rate in the first six months of fiscal 2020 was 0.3% compared to 14.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019. And this accounted for the majority of the decrease in our year-to-date effective rate. The larger benefit from stock option exercise recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was the result of more stock options exercised as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the optionees' holding period. The majority of options exercised, which generated this cash windfall for HEICO were approaching their 10-year expiration dates. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests were $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $8.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $13.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $17 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 principally, reflects the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019, which effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries back to HEICO's Flight Support Group. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remains very strong. As I previously discussed, cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong increasing 15% to $205.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $178.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Our working capital ratio improved to 4.4 times as of April 30 as compared to 2.8 as October 31, 2019. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 44 days as of April 30, 2020 compared to 45 days compared to April 30, 2019. Of course, we continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales and our top five customers represented approximately 24% and 21% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory rate increased to 139 days for the period ending April 30, 2020 and that compared to 126 days for the period ended April 30, 2019. The increase in the turnover rate reflects certain inventory purchase commitments based on pre-outbreak net sales expectations and also to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now let's talk about the outlook. Our results of operation for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 have been affected by the outbreak. In our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period January -- ending January 31, 2020 we provided financial guidance for fiscal 2020, but noted that it excluded any impact from the coronavirus outbreak because it was such an early stage. As noted within our Form 8-K filed on April 15, 2020 we withdrew our fiscal 2020 financial guidance due to the recent developments pertaining to the impact from the outbreak. HEICO entered the outbreak with a healthy balance sheet that included strong cash position and nominal debt. We cannot estimate the duration and magnitude of the outbreak and cannot confidently predict when demand for our commercial aerospace products will return to pre-outbreak levels. However, we believe that HEICO is favorably positioned for long-term success despite the short-term challenges created by the outbreak in the global economy. Our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring and operating high cash-generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aerospace such as defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics and medical puts us in a good financial position to weather this period of economic uncertainty. Accordingly, we continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. I would like to end by thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team is focused on your safety and your professional success. We will exit this outbreak stronger than before. That strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, our mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding our customers' expectations and we thank all of our team members for all of the things you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I would also like to point out that HEICO's Executive team has gone through at least three, four, maybe five situations similar to this COVID-19 outbreak. We went through the 9/11, we went through SARS, we went through the 2008 financial collapse, and in every event HEICO came back stronger and more profitable than before. I am completely confident and our management team is completely confident that we will again repeat this performance. So, again thank you all. And now we can open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] For the first question we have Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Larry I'm going to have a couple of questions on FSG, so I guess these will go to Eric. And look Eric, obviously, this is an incredibly dynamic situation. And we -- I think we can all appreciate the lack of visibility due to the virus. But how would you characterize the cadence of Q2 February through April, how do we think about it in components as this thing accelerated? And then how might we frame that in the context of when a bottom is? To be clear you wouldn't have reached that in the quarter.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Rob. That's a very good question and we've spent a lot of time internally thinking about that and looking at what happened. Basically February was an outstanding month. It was a short month but had it been the length of the other months it probably would have been a record month for us. And we entered March very strong. I would say that March overall was quite decent. It did start coming off in the second half of the month, but still we were able to hold our own in March. April was the point where we really started to get impacted. And of course, we still had some backlog that was preordered before the month began so April started coming down. And you can see the results where they are now. I think we are hopeful that May is probably the bottom of the crisis. It's very hard to say that with all certainty. May has not concluded yet. We're starting to get June orders. Remember, we get most of our orders in the month of shipment. So, it's very hard to have visibility. But as we can see as enthusiasm in the country starts improving as therapeutics or vaccines look like they're coming along and people are getting more comfortable with the idea of traveling we think that it should be up from here. That would really be our internal guess. If you want to get into the numbers, we've stress tested our sales and earnings to make sure that we can withstand whatever may come our way. And we believe that within the Flight Support Group based on the current expense levels that we can sustain a drop of sales in Flight Support in the 50% to 60% area and still breakeven. Now, that 50% to 60% drop in Flight Support sales would imply probably a 70% to 80% drop in the aftermarket. But with all of the business units we've run those numbers, we understand what that is. And when I say breakeven at 50% to 60% down that is after writing off all of the inefficiencies and the under-absorbed overheads that would end up getting incurred in a reduced volume environment.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just -- I appreciate all that. That's very helpful. One other thing I wanted to ask you and perhaps to just compare with what we've heard from some of your peers and this has to do with used serviceable material in the parked fleet. Some of your peers have noted that it's not really an issue until price points get above about $5,000. Would you agree with that? And what is FSG's exposure at those higher levels if at all?\nEric Mendelson: I would agree with that. And I've been on the calls where people have suggested those numbers. We think the $5,000 mark is probably a good number. I can tell you that less than -- and we have not disclosed this in the past due to competitive reasons but based on where we are in the cycle and the crisis, I think it's something which is reasonable to speak about now that only less than 10% of our PMA sales have -- less than 10% of our PMA sales volume is driven by parts that cost over $5,000. So, therefore, we believe that our focus on the type of products that we've done would tend to not lend themselves to as much cannibalization as a result of used serviceable material.\nRobert Spingarn: Got it. Got it. Thank you very much. I'll jump back in. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question for you is from Peter Arment from Baird. Line is open.\nPeter Arment: Thank you. Good morning Larry, Victor, Eric, Carlos.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Eric I guess you're going to be popular today, so I'll continue to talk about FSG. I guess maybe you could just talk a little bit about when you said that stress test regarding FSG how does that -- how are you thinking about that with -- in the context of all the retirements that we're hearing about or when you think about the age of fleet? What that's going to look like? How do you think about that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, Peter, that's a great question. What we see right now the initial impact of course is if the airlines aren't flying the aircraft they don't need the parts. And they need to burn off their inventories and we've been through various examples of how destocking works. But basically if an airline is using let's just say 100 units of a particular widget before the crisis and they wanted to maintain let's just say three months of inventory on hand that would be 300 units. If due to consumption the demand hypothetically falls 50%, then they would only be using 50 units. And if they wanted the whole three months of inventory and of course in some cases they want to hold less due to the financial impact that they are suffering right now, they would only need 150 pieces. So therefore, if they had 300 on the shelf, they only need 150. They're going to have to burn through 150 pieces before they place those orders. So I think that's the initial impact that everybody in the industry is seeing. Then you've got a further breakout in the economy between components and engines. So we believe that the sales of component overhaul, component parts is going to be fairly linear to number of flights or available seat miles, because airlines typically are not going to remove a serviceable component from a serviceable airplane and stick it on another aircraft and then end up with an unserviceable airplane that they just cannibalized. So we think that the sales of component overhaul and component parts will come back first. We believe that the engines will be more impacted and that airlines will figure out how to not induct engines and not either swap them off aircraft that have good engines as needed or just delay the engines going into the shop. And then of course heavy maintenance is the last part. So roughly two-thirds of our PMA sales are in the component area. And we expect that that is going to come back before the engines and the heavy maintenance. Now how does -- your question was on retirements. So airlines have obviously faced with a dilemma. Do they continue to fly the existing equipment or do they go ahead and take deliveries? We could have a whole debate on this. Our belief is that in areas where airlines are going to lose significant deposits, they're going to take those deliveries. But by and large, they're going to defer the maintenance on the planes that require the most dollars to be able to fly, but that it will make sense to go ahead and make that equipment serviceable before they take deliveries of new aircraft. And I'm not saying that deliveries of new aircraft is going to shut off, it's not, but we think that that's going to be more seriously impacted. So that's sort of how we look at the market.\nPeter Arment: That's very helpful color. And if I could just ask one, Larry, just regarding thoughts on M&A. I know you've had kind of an active pipeline before COVID-19. Maybe just give us your thoughts on deploying capital now during this environment?\nLarry Mendelson: Well we -- we're in a very -- as you know because you read our reports, we're in a very strong capital position. We have very low debt, very low leverage. We have great availability. We are actively in the market. We are doing due diligence on a number of projects. As you can imagine with the travel restrictions and difficulty in COVID, the due diligence process is extended because we can't get out to the locations as often and as thoroughly as we might like. But I would say that we're ready to make the acquisitions if they make sense. We don't change our basic principles. We won an acquisition that's going to be accretive, that's going to have cash flow, that's going to earn its keep so to speak. If we write a check, we expect to bring that acquisition in-house and have it accretive in the first year. In the aerospace group, there are companies which are suffering. So in order to pay the price that they may want doesn't really work for us. It doesn't work in our model and we're not going to get ourselves in a cash crunch. We -- I have said for many years that HEICO is not an aerospace or electronics company, it is a vehicle that generates strong cash flow and that's what we do. And we will make decisions based upon our cash flow profitability. But I can tell you that I wouldn't be surprised, if we were to announce an -- I can't definitely tell you, because you never know until the deal closes if it will. But I can tell you we have an appetite. We have the financial capability and we are active as we can possibly be.\nPeter Arment: Thank you very much, Larry.\nOperator: Next question is from Larry Solow from SJ Securities [ph]. Line is open.\nLarry Solow: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Good to hear your voices and hope all your families are doing well.\nLarry Mendelson: Thank you, Larry.\nLarry Solow: Absolutely. Just a few follow-ups. Just on the aircraft retirement question. Obviously, a lot of talk about retirement of planes going forward. Can you sort of just speak to that drop off versus -- I know there's been a -- over the last 10 years or so a big build-out of new aircraft and a lot of those probably have not -- have been on warranty. So you guys haven't been benefiting from that. Will there be some offset there as you look at it, obviously we don't know exactly how many planes get retired, but I imagine there'll be some offset as some of these newer aircraft go off warranty. Is that a fair statement?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think the -- Larry this is Eric. As you said, as the aircraft come out of warranty, they really come into our sweet spot. There's all debate over what's going to be permanently retired and what's going to be temporarily retired. I think that there's a fair amount of optimism that a lot of equipment does go back into service. Of course, there's been a delay in the production of new equipment and of course the bill rates have been reduced. So again, we're optimistic because even if you assume an aggressive retirement schedule. You've still got all of the other equipment aging one year per year. The fleet is approximately 25,000 aircraft. So even if a chunk of aircraft come out then -- so be if they will, we don't think we're going to be hit as a result of cannibalization that badly. And yes, there will be a short-term impact. But we think that as the lion share of the aircraft that remain in service age that that will provide plenty of opportunity for us in terms of our sales whether it's parts or repairs.\nLarry Solow: Okay. And just in terms of, obviously, again, hard to read in the future, but in prior downturns, although, this could be a little bit more extraordinary. But in prior downturns, obviously, the motivation of the incentive and demand for PMA parts has spiked and could very well happen again this time around. What about -- just in terms of the outlook for -- you guys have sort of maintained a level of new parts per year. Without getting into specifics, is there any thought of maybe, as we look out in the future maybe increasing the amount of PMA parts you introduce on an annual basis, if demand does increase?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. It's something that we are capable of doing. We've done a very thorough review of our new product development pipeline, wanting to make sure that everything that we've -- that we're spending money on and that we're going to develop and source, that in fact there is going to be a need for us. So we've gone ahead and done that. At this moment, we haven't increased the amount of new product development, but we're basically holding it roughly steady and consistent with prior years, because we want to make sure that we're able to support the airlines coming out of this crisis. And we think we're going to be in a very good position to be able to support the airlines. And I know that this is sort of my perspective and as a result of my involvement with HEICO. But I really do believe that, it's important that people not conflate the growth of PMA with the growth of HEICO, in that, I think, airlines look at HEICO. HEICO is a $10 billion market cap company. We're a respected and serious industry participant. All of the major companies are aware of us. And as I've said many times, the PMA industry is not an easy business to be in. It's very difficult and we have to fight for every single piece of business that we have. So I'd be very careful about making a statement -- and I don't mean you, but I mean people, in general, making a statement that PMA is going to do very well coming out of this crisis. I have a lot of confidence that HEICO is going to be able to do very well, coming out of this crisis, because of the products that we offer and our financial stability. Looking at other companies, I'm not so sure. I think that they're going to have a lot of -- they're going to have a lot of pressure. If you look at other companies, sort of, how they've done over a longer period of time. The PMA space has not been very good for them. So I think our model of continuing to develop new parts and making sure that we take care of the customers and we're very fair on pricing, I think, really wins us a lot of friends. And for that reason, I'm very optimistic on our future.\nLarry Solow: Right. So it sounds like an opportunity for you to hopefully take some -- potential take some market share.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I do feel that our market share is going to continue to go up. Our market share in PMA was already high, but it's even gone higher. And I anticipate that's going to continue.\nLarry Solow: Great. Okay. I'm going to -- just switching gears on a question for Victor, keep him on his toes.\nVictor Mendelson: Thanks, Larry. I was starting to feel like chopped liver here.\nLarry Solow: Never, never. Just quickly for you. Obviously, some of your businesses are somewhat more insulated -- well, certainly against the consumer, the defense and the medical side. And, yes, I think you mentioned space, you expect a rebound in the back half. How about just on the -- sort of on the general industrial piece of your business, which I think is, I don't know, 20% -- 15% 20% of the segment. Is that piece maybe more susceptible to a downturn?\nVictor Mendelson: Larry, I would say, that is more susceptible. It's held up pretty well. It's been choppier though overall. And it's harder to predict. I think it will be softer than the rest of the business certainly than space and defense. And we'll just have to see how it plays out.\nLarry Solow: Fair enough. Okay. Just lastly, follow up on the -- just on the accounts receivable. Is there any way to sort of decipher the aging of your receivables? Has that gotten materially different over the last quarter? And then, just last question, just you took a little bit of a drawdown on your revolver. What's the sort of thoughts on that? Thanks.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks for the question, Larry. So the receivables are actually very high quality right now. We did a good job on collections during the quarter. And as you can see from the press release, receivables are down as a source of cash for us. So that was very good. The aging has not deteriorated. I mean, candidly, I am worried about airline bankruptcies and that impact on our receivables. We don't tend to have high concentrations within any one airline or any what I'll call significant exposures. But for the health of the industry, I do worry about that and we'll see how that plays out over the next three to six months. As far as the draw, you're correct, we took a draw in March and I did that preemptively to make sure that if the banks, for whatever reason, seized up, as we saw back in the financial crisis that HEICO wasn't at the mercy of the banks in the case, where we needed to draw on the line for an acquisition or for whatever capital needs we had. And so, I took the draw in a proactive state. You could see we didn't use it. We have about close to $350 million sitting on the balance sheet right now. And my carrying cost for that is so low, that I'm going to let it sit there for a while. And if we use it for acquisitions, great. If not, we'll just repay the line with it.\nLarry Solow: Great. All right. Awesome guys. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning \nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I had a couple of follow-up questions. I guess the first -- I don't know, Eric, if you could characterize this, but in terms of kind of what you're seeing in current orders and demand on the PMA side, should we just assume it's sort of down in line with available seat miles? Or is there any discernible difference at this point? I'm just curious we all assume that you're going to pick up share, relative to just general aftermarket part suppliers. But I wonder, like, in the current environment, is it just kind of Armageddon, everything is down at or around the same rate as ASMs or worse? Or anything you can say about kind of May trends?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, that's a great question. In the past, in order to sort of keep things simple, we used to say that the greatest proxy for the aftermarket was really available seat miles. Ultimately, passenger seat miles would impact available seat miles, but available seat miles were really the driver. And as we got into this crisis, we realized, yes, I mean, obviously, that's important. But just the number of flights is also very important. Most of our sales have always been on the narrow-body product. So wide-body is what's obviously most impacted right now or even more impacted than narrow-body. And most of our sales are over on the narrow-body. So, I would say number of flights is probably the highest correlated to the aftermarket right now and the thing that we're really looking at. But remember, the other issue that you've got as I mentioned earlier was the destocking phenomenon. And that is extremely sharp and extremely painful in the beginning because, everybody's got to burn off their inventory. And until that happens, it's very hard to see a rebound. But I would say that's probably the big driver for us the number of flights.\nGautam Khanna: And to follow-up on that, is there any way you can give us some rule of thumb on the mix of PMA that you guys have? How -- what percentage is narrow-body versus wide-body so that we are tracking the right data points 75-25?\nEric Mendelson: I don't have that with me, but I'm guessing that the 75-25 is probably a good guess on what it is. It sometimes can get a little complicated because some of the components can go on a narrow-body aircraft as well as a wide-body aircraft. So you have to make all sorts of assumptions. But I would say yes, the 75% narrow-body is probably a good rough approximation of it.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. That's really helpful. Victor, I was also wondering, in your business, what are sort of bookings trends looking like? Obviously, we have very difficult comparisons this year because of the great growth last year. But I just want to see like how much do we have left in terms of organic growth? What's your visibility at this point? If you could speak to that.\nVictor Mendelson: Bookings in the ETG are -- they tend to get batched in the business particularly on the defense side and the space side. So, they tend to come in, in large amounts. And so recently within the last couple of months, we've had some very large orders that have come in. So, order flow on defense and space has been pretty strong for us. And that's why we made the comment in the release that we had softer shipments in space. We didn't say softer demand. We referred to softer shipment because demand in space for us remains strong.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And those convert in the second half. Would you expect or...\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. That would be -- that will start to materialize in the second half of the year as well as in 2021 -- fiscal 2021 for us.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And Larry, one last one for you, if you don't mind, you talked a little bit about the acquisition pipeline and certainly the interest in doing acquisitions.\nLaurans Mendelson: The acquisition pipe, we are looking. We're doing due diligence on a number of companies. Again, earlier I commented on acquisitions and it's more difficult because of logistics issues getting out doing the due diligence. We do a very thorough due diligence. We go out to factories we look at, how they're manufacturing, what their manufacturing processes are. In addition to financial, we study the markets. And so we do a very thorough due diligence process. It's more difficult because, we can't get out to the sites as easily because of the COVID. But again, we have a great appetite. Our appetite for acquisition has not changed at all. And as a matter of fact we're cautiously optimistic that we will see some opportunities. Maybe people will be willing to sell at prices that match our strategy because we don't pay 14 or 12 times EBITDA. And we're hoping that, some of the competition that we used to get from private equity might be less because of the -- their -- private equities' less ability to raise funds in this environment. We have plenty of availability capital. We're not capital constrained. We have very low debt level. So, we are aggressively looking for acquisitions. Now saying that, many companies have seen particularly in the aerospace side have seen their revenues drop. And we normally do not pay prices based upon future promises. We want companies that will carry their weight, generate cash flow, generate the margins that we demand at HEICO. So our discipline has not changed and we will never want to grow just to be bigger. We only will grow to be more cash flow positive. So, I think the opportunities are out there. I think over the next six months or a year, I would think we will see more opportunities. And we're open for business. We'd like to make as many good transactions as we can.\nGautam Khanna: Would you say that there's larger acquisition opportunities that have showed up in the pipeline -- kind of shown up as of late or are there...\nLaurans Mendelson: No I think it's all -- it's pretty much the same. The mix is pretty much the same. We look at large ones. We look at smaller ones. We -- again the key for us is not big. The key -- investment bankers come to us and they bring us deals where there's 7% or 11% operating margins they're big. But we're not interested in big. We want cash flow. So we want 20% 30% operating margins that really earn their keep with great entrepreneurial management. Just to be big HEICO is not a company that wants to grow to just be big. We will always grow to be cash flow big. That's where we want to be big. And so, the size of the company is not nearly as important as the profitability and the cash flow.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you, very much guys.\nOperator: Next question here we have Ken Herbert from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKen Herbert: Hi good morning everybody, really nice quarter.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Eric, I just wanted to start with you. I wanted to follow-up on a comment you made earlier regarding your expectations maybe for the recovery as you look at the aspects of the aftermarket component versus engine versus heavy maybe. And as you think about for your business maybe a delay or a lag in the engine recovery relative to component, is that maybe a matter of months, maybe a matter of quarters? Any sort of quantification or how you're sort of expecting the recovery to play out on engine versus component and timing would be very interesting.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Ken that's a very good question. I know you've been writing about this topic and very much focused on it which I think is very good. My personal belief is that airlines are not going to induct engines until they absolutely have to. So I think that that is again the last thing to come back. I think there'll be heavy maintenance. I don't think there are going to be many to induct heavy maintenance until they absolutely have to. And with engines I think they're going to wait. So how much longer that is from components. I think it's really on very much a case-by-case basis. But I'm guessing that it could be six months delayed from when the components come in. But it's really \u2013 it's something that we're going to have to look at depending on the particular engine type and the airline that is operating it. But I definitely expect them to really want to conserve cash. And of course, engines that need a lot of life-limited parts, those it goes without saying are really going to be at the end of the line. And I think those are the \u2013 as a part of the aftermarket that's really going to experience the most short-term and perhaps intermediate term pain. And those will end up getting overhauled but I think that's just further down the line.\nKen Herbert: Yes. That's very helpful. Do you get a sense that as you look out over the next six to 12 months or so as things do come back that relative to prior downturns there will be more sort of green time availability on the engine fleet today, which certainly could further sort of depress the timing of the engine recovery?\nEric Mendelson: I think, yes. I think definitely the airlines are going to manage the green time very effectively. There are also lessors out there, who are being very creative and very innovative on buying up engines with green time, buying up aircraft taking off the engines to the point where the engines don't have to be overhauled as much. And there are lessors out there, who recognize that what airlines care about is thrust. They want safe thrust. And I think a number of OEMs have gotten away with conflating their sales of spare parts with the quality or the aftermarket demand for the remarketability of those engines. And we've seen lessors go out there and recognize that airlines are just as happy to operate engines which have alternative material in them. And the airlines are able to achieve savings, the lessors are able to make money. So I do think that engines that have more OEM material and require more of the life-limited parts are going to be delayed. And definitely the green time engines are going to be used first.\nKen Herbert: Great. And if I could, Eric just one more I appreciate all the extra detail you're giving today. As you think about the cash preservation or conservation approach from the airlines which I completely agree with. Do you think that presents any incremental opportunities for you with emerging market airlines or airlines that historically have not been where you maybe had a less representation relative to more established airlines? Does this current environment maybe provide the opportunity for you to accelerate the work with some customers that you've historically not done as much work with?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Absolutely, Ken. We believe that there is a lot of opportunity for us in those markets. Those discussions were actually occurring before the COVID crisis. They had really picked up in the months before COVID. And now with the airlines being really behind the eight ball, we anticipate, I think really for HEICO and that goes to my earlier comment in that HEICO is recognized as a serious industry player with a $10-plus billion market cap and we're able to stand behind these products. So I think that we are going to disproportionately benefit on the rebound. And I think these airlines are going to see the opportunity that a HEICO solution can give them. So yes, I do anticipate us being able to sort of mitigate the downturn and pick up market share as a result of picking up some of these customers where we didn't do as much with them in the past.\nKen Herbert: Great. Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, sir we have Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: You guys have had more of an entrepreneurial acquisition model with your portfolio companies. Can you talk about the relationship in this environment? How much are you directing to those portfolio companies to implement disciplined cost reductions versus what they're doing organically?\nVictor Mendelson: We \u2013 Josh, it's Victor. We really [Audio Gap] business. That doesn't mean we don't have [Audio Gap] about it. But ultimately, we expect them to be the same company as they were pre-acquisition. And you've heard us say that the key is buying right that if you buy the right business and you buy the right kind of company that does the right things then you don't have to direct them post acquisition. So our companies took it upon themselves to take the actions that they've taken individually and they've done what's right at the local level. And they're the right ones to make those judgments because they need to make sure they save where they can save. But at the same time, we know that we'll come out of this and we need to grow and HEICO is a growth company and we'll continue growing. So we have to take the right actions across the board. The other part is one of motivation that we don't want to demotivate our managers by ruling from on high so to speak and ruling from on top. So it's a combination of those things. And what we have noticed and again, over a period of decades dealing with downturns and crises is that it works. It actually is very effective that we get to the levels we need to get to and we get the reductions that we need to get. But we do it in a much more humane way and a much less disruptive way than the companies that come out and say \"That's it. We're getting rid of 20% of our people\" and then people are quaking in their boots as to who's next. And we find better, I think better and creative ways to keep our folks motivated and happy.\nLaurans Mendelson: Josh, this is Larry. Just to add to what Victor said, I agree completely. To simplify it, you think of the carrot and a stick. So in a decentralized company as HEICO is, we would much prefer the carrot than the stick. And all of the business unit managers and presidents of the companies are incentivized to a very high degree to produce good results. They are also basically entrepreneurial when we acquired the company as Victor told you. So by incentivizing them to do the right thing, we don't have to hit them with a stick. These guys are really, really smart operators. They are terrific. So that's the benefit that we get running a highly decentralized company. Now they report to us. We know what they're doing. We get financial reports weekly, but these people are known entities and they know exactly what to do. We have a group, I would say, what doesn't show up in the financial statement is the brilliance of the managers that we have running these companies. So I think that's at the heart of it.\nJosh Sullivan: All right. Appreciate that. And then just kind of relatedly, as far as the free cash flow outlook, if May isn't the trough for commercial aerospace, how sensitive is that guidance? Or any thoughts around that?\nOperator: Apologies everyone. We will resume the conference in a moment. Please stand by. We will resume shortly. Thank you. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the speakers are now back.\nLaurans Mendelson: Okay. So Josh, are you still there?\nJosh Sullivan: Yes. Yes, I'm here.\nLaurans Mendelson: I'm sorry there's something -- we must have had a power failure here and the system went down and just disconnected. \nJosh Sullivan: No problem.\nLaurans Mendelson: Did you get? Were you satisfied with -- did you get the whole answer?\nJosh Sullivan: We did. I was actually just beginning the next one.\nLaurans Mendelson: Okay.\nJosh Sullivan: Thank you, sir. And just as far as the free cash flow outlook, if May isn't the trough for commercial aerospace. How sensitive is that free cash flow guidance essentially?\nCarlos Macau: Josh, this is Carlos. I just want to reiterate. We haven't given free cash flow guidance. The guidance we've given is that we will remain cash flow positive. We have measured -- it was a very -- a highly variable cost structure, which allows us to flex the business and maintain cash flow positive. So, I want to be very careful that we're not putting numbers to that because as a management team, we're dealing with this without the luxury of having a certainty in the future here.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the time. Eric, you're popular today. So I apologize. And I know you've talked about this a bunch, but I want to delve in more into the PMA market. And I know you guys have the best share, because of your product offering and your rigorous process behind it. I wanted to see how you're thinking about balancing airlines choosing lower cost products, and also the aircraft ages, aircraft being retired at say 18 years old versus 24 years old. So how those two things balance each other as you think about gaining share in this market?\nEric Mendelson: Sure Sheila, that's a good question. And I've been reading your material throughout the whole crisis. I found it very interesting with the -- a lot of the data that you've had in there. I think the big driver is going to be the aircraft that need first heavy maintenance and then engine maintenance. And I think that's going to be the driver before the age. In other words, if you could have hypothetically an 18-year-old aircraft that needs a lot of money to be put in it in order to fly whereas you just overhauled a 24-year old aircraft and you're going to end up deciding to fly the 24-year old aircraft because from a cash perspective, you don't need to put money in it. So I think it's going to be very much based on an airline by airline, fleet by fleet aircraft serial number by serial member as they figure out which aircraft they're going to use. But we are in the process -- we're part of a study whereby, we've got somebody looking into this for us to be able to determine what areas are going to be impacted the most and basically come back online. So I think that's really how we look at it more on a cash-in basis as opposed to a straight age basis. Now having said that, if you've got two aircrafts hypothetically and they both need the same number of dollars to be made viable then obviously to the extent you own both of them then you would pick obviously the younger one because you would have a longer life in that. However, I think a lot of this gets very complicated because it depends what's leased, what airlines are able to give back, what's owned, what's fully depreciated. And it's a fairly complicated calculation. So I don't think it's going to be a one size fits all. approach.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. No, that makes sense. I appreciate the extra color and I think you guys will always prove the market wrong in some ways, and myself wrong. In terms of 10% of your business that's actually OE, I believe within FSG, can you talk about your expectations for that part of the business? And then on your breakeven forecast of 50% to 60% decline, does that assume any sort of cost cutting? Or is that just the current SG&A compression we've seen thus far?\nEric Mendelson: Yes that's a good question Sheila. Let me start with the second part of the question. We have done layoffs we -- our number one asset is our people. So we've been very careful to try to impact our people the least as possible. Having said that, with the current reality and the reduced level of business, we've had to make some adjustments, so we have done layoffs, we have done furloughs, we have done voluntary programs where people are not working one or two days a week. And then we've also done wage -- temporary wage reductions which we've all taken in order to be able to pitch it. When you put all of that together, we've calculated that our breakeven on FSG is, we can withstand a drop of 50% to 60% in total sales. And if you assume roughly that FSG is approximately 80% aftermarket and let's just say, the aftermarket is down pick a number 70% then that implies basically a 70% to 80% drop in the aftermarket. We think that initially the drop in the OEM sales, initially coming out of the chute wasn't as much because they have certain amount on order, but that is going to start to kick in. So we anticipate again aftermarket down sharply, but OEM not down as much but that reduction is going to last longer than the aftermarket because we anticipate the aftermarket is going to come back first. So I would say that's sort of how do we look at it.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: That makes sense, thank you so much for all the color everyone.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Sheila.\nOperator: Next question. We have Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the time here to take the questions. Maybe Eric and Carlos on this -- to kind of say on Sheila's question, if we look at the second quarter here the falloff that you saw in April probably assumes -- maybe revenues were down 50% or so. I mean should we think about FSG being down in that 50% to 60% range for the next two quarters or so? And I just wanted to tie in the SG&A down at 15% or so of revenues for the quarter, I think you guys usually run at kind of 17.5%. I mean are you resizing the business that low level of SG&A sort of implies that the full year revenue run rate maybe it comes in below $1.7 billion or so. Is that the right way we should be thinking about this the current SG&A in the quarter? And then I guess the kind of what you just said Eric with the aftermarket down sharply in terms of tying together a growth rate for the next quarter or two?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So Mike, this is Eric and that's a great question. We have to be careful because we have withdrawn guidance because we truly don't know what the numbers are going to be. We've seen the impact thus far. We see that airlines are not flying. We care about our people. As I said number one, it's about our people. And so we obviously had to reduce our cost structure to be able to live with this new reality, but we want to make sure that we're able in terms of new product development, developing new stuff, as well as maintaining our sales force and maintaining the leadership in our businesses that we are able to respond. So that's why we're providing this, if you will a framework that FSG can be down 50% to 60% in revenue and still breakeven. It does -- as that revenue falls we do approach more of the breakeven area. And the reason we give the range of 50% to 60% is it depends very much on mix. But the other thing which is very important to note is that, we've always had -- this has gone back 30 years. We've always had an extremely conservative accounting model and accounting standards. One of the old tricks in manufacturing is that, when volumes fall one of the ways that companies can delay taking the pain is basically by increasing cost in pulling in the block costs that ends up getting amortized or increasing the standard costing of products going forward. We're very careful to not do that. So we write-off, when we have excess manufacturing costs and underutilized overhead, we're very careful to write that off. So we don't have future pain. So when I say that, our numbers are down, you can withstand a drop of 50%, 60% and still breakeven that's after taking all of the inventory reserves and writing off all of the excess manufacturing costs and not putting them into inventory, not putting them into fixed assets, and not doing things that we think are really \u2013 would penalize the long term. We want our businesses to understand very clearly, how they're doing in the short term. And if companies play around, and they play games, and they end up reporting higher short-term profits in order to delay the pain, then that just confuses the team members on really where you stand. So I hope that, gives you a little bit of idea or color into how we're thinking about this.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Yeah. No that's extremely helpful. And then just another one, Eric. On your customers and looking at the fragility of the airlines here have you done an analysis of your airline customer base from the big majors down to the ultra low-cost carriers to maybe \u2013 as you're stress testing the model to get a sense of, which one of your customers might really be at risk of bankruptcy or failure here as this kind of pandemic carries on? And certainly, there's going to be some failures out there I'd imagine, but have you kind of looked at the customer list from that regard?\nEric Mendelson: We have \u2013 but it becomes honestly very complicated to build the revenue model based on that. We do look at it. But Carlos, we'll let him comment on our accounts receivable process, but we are careful with regard to companies that are at risk of filing for insolvency or bankruptcy. And yes, we do get stung and we like to make sure that we're supporting our customers, but we want to do so in an intelligent way, and Carlos can expand on that.\nCarlos Macau: Mike, this is Carlos. So big concern on your part, I mean, we're all reading the papers and seeing the industry e-mail. There will be some \u2013 there probably will be some bankruptcies in the airline space. And I don't know, if it's going to be domestic foreign, I don't know what geography \u2013 we're going to see it. And the one thing, we've done to try and limit that exposure is we've sat down with all of our folks who meticulously lot of turn over there, credit limits that give the customers make sure that they're mindful about the collecting side. And they're not overextending HEICO. We don't want to be anybody's bank. By the same token, we still have to conduct business in a relatively normal fashion with these customers, because we don't want to burn any customer's good will by acting too unusual during this time period. So it's a fine line we got to balance. I would say during the quarter, our receivables were in very good shape. The age of the receivables was very new. There wasn't a lot of any stuff overextended. But going into Q3 and Q4, we just have to be mindful. And if there are bankruptcies we'll deal with it. But because of our diversified platform and the fact that we are dealing with multiple airlines across the globe, we don't have a ton of exposure or concentration in any one airline that could cause us major issues. I hope that makes sense.\nMichael Ciarmoli: It does. It does. And then just a point of clarification on Josh's question. You guys mentioned or even in the press release that, you can maintain positive cash from operations, so not necessarily free cash flow. But clearly you guys are comfortable in looking at maybe working capital managing inventory some of those variable costs. So clearly, cash from ops is going to be positive for the remainder of the year?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. That's the scenario, Eric described a little while ago, if we stress test the business at extreme levels we still wind up with positive cash flow.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Colin Ducharme from Sterling Capital. Your line is open.\nColin Ducharme: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope the HEICO family is all healthy and safe. I had a quick clarification for Carlos. Regarding the expense rationalization kind of framework, you've talked about the playbook a bit, bottom-up very entrepreneurial which is consistent with prior messaging at the subsidiary level. But clarifying so substantially all of that expense reduction has that been bottom-up and coming from the constituent businesses versus being framed top-down?\nCarlos Macau: That's correct, Colin. So I think as Victor mentioned earlier, we're very \u2013 first of all, we \u2013 our guys that manage these businesses are incredibly entrepreneurial. And the one thing we have noticed about them is they don't change much. When they own the business and they ran it, they ran it using their check book and just because HEICO is either co-invested with them or acquired the business, it doesn't seem to change the way that they manage or the frame of references they have on how to deal with both good and challenging times. And so what we've noticed is that, these folks at these subsidiaries, because we allow them to operate in a decentralized fashion, they do make good decisions and they do tighten their belts when they need to. They're very aware of and conscientious of working capital management of listening to their customers, understanding demand as best that they can during this time period. And so we haven't \u2013 we don't have a need or we haven't felt the \u2013 we haven't felt it necessary that we'd be heavy handed in these circumstances. They have done the right things. It just so happens that with them doing what they need to do to manage their businesses, which we had also contribute at the corporate level by taking some pay reductions by the executives and the corporate staff and are also Board of Directors. So we've sort of all contributed, if you would to the collective misery of challenging times. And of course, we hope that this is short-term and that we can all get back to normal as soon as possible.\nColin Ducharme: Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to get \u2013 take a look at the M&A kind of outlook and perhaps view it in a different lens. Larry was very clear in that a nice frame for HEICO is a vehicle for free cash flow and you're looking for solid cash flow from your targets over time, recognizing that that frame has been consistent over time. One could also equally recognize the unique nature of this crisis. You guys have been through several, but none as far as I know have seen seat miles collapse 95-ish percent. And so I guess, my question is maintaining that free cash frame are you willing to consider targets that our long-term quality assets with a quality longer-term outlook, which are distressed in nature today and facing liquidity pinches where you could foresee them becoming part of the HEICO family and expanding your aperture given the unique complexion of this crisis?\nLaurans Mendelson: Let me answer \u2013 this is Larry. We will look at those kinds of companies depending upon what we think their ultimate profitability will be. So the answer is yes. We are inclined not to pay up for pie in the sky in the future. But there are some companies that we know of now that we're looking at that meet those kind of qualifications that you just mentioned. We'll have to see how they work out? What the price is if they're for sale? So -- yeah, but we would consider, -- so the answer to your question is, yes.\nVictor Mendelson: And this is Victor. I'll just add to that. We cast a very broad net, in the acquisitions we look at and look for. So we consider many different transactions and different styles. And that's very important to what we do. So we understand we've got to look at a lot of things and consider many things, in order to find the right one. So we are willing to look and consider all style of deals even ones that may not be performing well and even may be distressed at this point.\nColin Ducharme: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question we have Louis Raffetto from UBS. Your line is open.\nLouis Raffetto: Hey good morning guys.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLouis Raffetto: So sorry Eric to get under here, but going to go, so I know in the past you said that, you traditionally didn't get onto an airplane until it was about 10 years old. So is that still the case? Is that primarily just for the PMA business? Or do you think that applies for sort of MRO as well?\nEric Mendelson: No. I think -- to clarify what I meant or what I said or what I meant to say, was that we typically don't get on a new airplane, until it doesn't have meaningful revenue to us until 10 years after the first delivery. But not 10 years after each aircraft is delivered. And it's probably shorter than that maybe its seven years or something like that. I would say that's the case more on the PMA and the repair side. On the distribution side we would be on it, right away. We'd be on it immediately. And of course in the specialty products, we would occur -- we would achieve revenue, even before it's delivered. So to put a little bit of color into that thought.\nLouis Raffetto: No that's great. Thank you. And so I know if we go back to kind of like 2014, 2015, 2016 area, when flight support didn't have that strong growth. One of the things you guys talked about back then. And you heard from other people in the industry was that the age of the fleet was kind of younger given the dynamics of increased retirements and newer planes coming in. So I guess, do you -- I don't know if anyone could argue with the fact that the age of fleet is likely to get quite a bit younger than the coming year or two. Do you think you'd be able to offset that with share gains?\nLaurans Mendelson: Yeah. So I think what you're referring to in the 2014-2015 time, was the reason our sales were lower then was because we had something like -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but something like 22% organic growth in the year or two before that. So I think what happened was a lot of equipment got deferred. There was a lot of deferred maintenance there was massive sales. We way outperformed in the period before. So then it slowed down a little bit, in that period. I think that's probably the thing that drove the lower sales growth in the 2014, 2015 time frame.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great and then just one follow-up on the M&A, so maybe Laurans might be best for you. You've traditionally talked about wanting deals, I think you said earlier 20% type of margins. I guess how do we circle that with the fact that, FSG has call it roughly 20% margins correct me if I'm wrong but I'm guessing that the PMA at market has higher margins and specialty products has lower margins. So is there a lot of opportunity there?\nLaurans Mendelson: Yeah. We think that -- I mean look, there's no question that it is hard to find those types of businesses over on the FSG side. I would say more often than not we're probably lower than that, in terms of margins. And then through our ability to increase the sales and to increase the profitability of the business going forward, we get it closer up to our area. But I would say, the 20% is something that we like to be. Sometimes we're able to find a business that's over 20%. But I wouldn't say that, that is a walk away point. If we see a very realistic path, then we could start with something that's below that number.\nLouis Raffetto: Great. Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Just to clarify I will not go for a company that has a very low margin, unless it's a bolt-on acquisition where we know. So if we buy a company, we bought loss companies at within FSG. We have purchased loss companies and within three months they have become big profit makers. Why? Because we strip that -- we moved the location, we closed the factory, and we merge it into one of our other operations. And then all of a sudden it goes from -- they could be a loss to over 20%.\nLouis Raffetto: Great. Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Keep in mind, we're looking for -- remember this because I don't know if you keep this in mind, when you write your reports. We are looking for constant cash flow and growth. That's what HEICO is all about. We get aerospace electronic technologies, whatever. HEICO is a vehicle to generate cash flow. And we do it through those two divisions which normally have high margins. And I think if you understand that, you'll understand HEICO better.\nOperator: And presenters last question we have Mr. Barry Haimes from Sage Asset Management. Your line is open.\nBarry Haimes: Thanks very much. I had two questions, I think both quick. One, can you for FSG just give us what the revenue decline was in the month of April, just so we have a marker on sort of where things were? And then second question was do you have any idea roughly the number of planes in the narrow-body fleet globally? And then, how many MAXes are built and sitting on the sidelines waiting to come into that fleet when we get approval, if and when we get approval? Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Yeah. So we -- the first question Barry with regard to April, we don't break out the specific numbers within the quarter. But I think you can do some back of the envelope math and sort of get an idea of where that is. The reason that we're not giving that out is because, it's not necessarily representative of if you will the bottom or how the entire quarter operated. With regard to the number of narrow-body aircraft, I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's somewhere in the 20,000 aircraft area. And with regard to the MAX, I think there are approximately 400 that were delivered, that have been parked. And then Boeing has got approximately another 400 -- in various stages of production that will need to get delivered.\nBarry Haimes: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you. \nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to the presenters. Thank you. \nLaurans Mendelson: Well, the management team in HEICO wants to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. We are available at any time. If you have other questions, you're welcome to call me, Carlos, Eric, Victor and if we can clarify anything and we're happy to discuss it. And otherwise, we look forward to speaking to you after the third quarter announcement. And that call will be sometime, I guess, in the middle of August, the end of August. So thank you all and please stay safe and healthy during this COVID epidemic. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Josh, this is Carlos. I just want to reiterate. We haven't given free cash flow guidance. The guidance we've given is that we will remain cash flow positive. We have measured -- it was a very -- a highly variable cost structure, which allows us to flex the business and maintain cash flow positive. So, I want to be very careful that we're not putting numbers to that because as a management team, we're dealing with this without the luxury of having a certainty in the future here. Mike, this is Carlos. So big concern on your part, I mean, we're all reading the papers and seeing the industry e-mail. There will be some \u2013 there probably will be some bankruptcies in the airline space. And I don't know, if it's going to be domestic foreign, I don't know what geography \u2013 we're going to see it. And the one thing, we've done to try and limit that exposure is we've sat down with all of our folks who meticulously lot of turn over there, credit limits that give the customers make sure that they're mindful about the collecting side. And they're not overextending HEICO. We don't want to be anybody's bank. By the same token, we still have to conduct business in a relatively normal fashion with these customers, because we don't want to burn any customer's good will by acting too unusual during this time period. So it's a fine line we got to balance. I would say during the quarter, our receivables were in very good shape. The age of the receivables was very new. There wasn't a lot of any stuff overextended. But going into Q3 and Q4, we just have to be mindful. And if there are bankruptcies we'll deal with it. But because of our diversified platform and the fact that we are dealing with multiple airlines across the globe, we don't have a ton of exposure or concentration in any one airline that could cause us major issues. I hope that makes sense. Yes. That's the scenario, Eric described a little while ago, if we stress test the business at extreme levels we still wind up with positive cash flow. Thank you. That's correct, Colin. So I think as Victor mentioned earlier, we're very \u2013 first of all, we \u2013 our guys that manage these businesses are incredibly entrepreneurial. And the one thing we have noticed about them is they don't change much. When they own the business and they ran it, they ran it using their check book and just because HEICO is either co-invested with them or acquired the business, it doesn't seem to change the way that they manage or the frame of references they have on how to deal with both good and challenging times. And so what we've noticed is that, these folks at these subsidiaries, because we allow them to operate in a decentralized fashion, they do make good decisions and they do tighten their belts when they need to. They're very aware of and conscientious of working capital management of listening to their customers, understanding demand as best that they can during this time period. And so we haven't \u2013 we don't have a need or we haven't felt the \u2013 we haven't felt it necessary that we'd be heavy handed in these circumstances. They have done the right things. It just so happens that with them doing what they need to do to manage their businesses, which we had also contribute at the corporate level by taking some pay reductions by the executives and the corporate staff and are also Board of Directors. So we've sort of all contributed, if you would to the collective misery of challenging times. And of course, we hope that this is short-term and that we can all get back to normal as soon as possible. Yeah. So we -- the first question Barry with regard to April, we don't break out the specific numbers within the quarter. But I think you can do some back of the envelope math and sort of get an idea of where that is. The reason that we're not giving that out is because, it's not necessarily representative of if you will the bottom or how the entire quarter operated. With regard to the number of narrow-body aircraft, I don't have that in front of me, but I think it's somewhere in the 20,000 aircraft area.

The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 2% to $219 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $214.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, partially offset by an organic net sales decrease of 2%. The organic net sales decrease is mainly attributable to lower space product shipments partially offset by increased demand for our space products. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 7% to a record $427.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from $398.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, as well as 2% organic growth mainly due to increased demand for our defense products partially offset by lower space product shipments. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income decreased 3% to $65.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to $67.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin mainly due to a decrease in net sales of our space and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales of our defense products as well as the previously mentioned net sales growth and lower performance-based compensation expense. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 3% to a record $123 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from $119 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and lower performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly due to a decrease in net sales of our space and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by increased net sales in our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to 29.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 is mainly due to the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense. Let me turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Thanks, Larry. I was starting to feel like chopped liver here. Larry, I would say, that is more susceptible. It's held up pretty well. It's been choppier though overall. And it's harder to predict. I think it will be softer than the rest of the business certainly than space and defense. And we'll just have to see how it plays out. Bookings in the ETG are -- they tend to get batched in the business particularly on the defense side and the space side. So, they tend to come in, in large amounts. And so recently within the last couple of months, we've had some very large orders that have come in. So, order flow on defense and space has been pretty strong for us. And that's why we made the comment in the release that we had softer shipments in space. We didn't say softer demand. We referred to softer shipment because demand in space for us remains strong. Yes. That would be -- that will start to materialize in the second half of the year as well as in 2021 -- fiscal 2021 for us. We \u2013 Josh, it's Victor. We really [Audio Gap] business. That doesn't mean we don't have [Audio Gap] about it. But ultimately, we expect them to be the same company as they were pre-acquisition. And you've heard us say that the key is buying right that if you buy the right business and you buy the right kind of company that does the right things then you don't have to direct them post acquisition. So our companies took it upon themselves to take the actions that they've taken individually and they've done what's right at the local level. And they're the right ones to make those judgments because they need to make sure they save where they can save. But at the same time, we know that we'll come out of this and we need to grow and HEICO is a growth company and we'll continue growing. So we have to take the right actions across the board. The other part is one of motivation that we don't want to demotivate our managers by ruling from on high so to speak and ruling from on top. So it's a combination of those things. And what we have noticed and again, over a period of decades dealing with downturns and crises is that it works. It actually is very effective that we get to the levels we need to get to and we get the reductions that we need to get. But we do it in a much more humane way and a much less disruptive way than the companies that come out and say \"That's it. We're getting rid of 20% of our people\" and then people are quaking in their boots as to who's next. And we find better, I think better and creative ways to keep our folks motivated and happy. And this is Victor. I'll just add to that. We cast a very broad net, in the acquisitions we look at and look for. So we consider many different transactions and different styles. And that's very important to what we do. So we understand we've got to look at a lot of things and consider many things, in order to find the right one. So we are willing to look and consider all style of deals even ones that may not be performing well and even may be distressed at this point. Good morning."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call, and we thank you for joining us. Welcome you to the HEICO second quarter fiscal '20 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Before reviewing our second quarter operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members. You have responded with distinction to the unprecedented challenge of serving our customers and your local communities during the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic. I am humbled by your collective actions and unwavering commitment to HEICO's success. I strongly believe your contributions to HEICO's entrepreneurial values and ownership culture will continue to produce a winning formula in the marketplace despite the near-term challenges that we face as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. I'll now take a few moments to discuss our second quarter operating results. The results of operations for the six and three months ended April 30, 2020 have been affected by COVID-19. The effects of the outbreak and related actions by governments around the world to mitigate its spread have impacted our team members, customers, suppliers and manufacturers. In response to the economic impact from the outbreak, we, at HEICO, have implemented certain cost reductions including layoffs, temporary reduced work hours, temporary pay reductions within various departments of our businesses, including our entire executive management team and our Board of Directors. Our response to the outbreak, including implementing varying health and safety measures at our facilities, including supplying and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, staggering work shifts, body temperature taking, increasing work from home capabilities, consistent and ongoing cleaning of workspaces in high-touch areas and establishing processes aligned with the Center for Disease and Control guidelines to work with any individual exposed to COVID-19 on the necessary quarantine period and the process for the individual to return to work. With respect to our results of operations, approximately half of our net sales are derived from defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics, medical and communications. Demand for products in that half of our business has not been fundamentally impacted, and its operational results remained materially consistent with the financial expectations prior to the outbreak. However, we have experienced, expect to continue experiencing, periodic operational disruptions resulting from supply chain disturbances, staffing challenges, including some of our customers, temporary facility closures, transportation interruptions and other conditions, which slow production or may increase cost. While these issues have not yet been material, it is possible to predict their future impact -- it is impossible to predict their future impact, and our current experience indicates that the likely effect will be to delay orders and shipments measured in weeks and months and to temporarily increase some costs and this as opposed to profoundly changing our business overall. Fortunately, many of our defense and medical component design, manufacturing and supply operations are believed to be crucial suppliers to markets with continuing strong needs, while it has not had a material impact on consolidated net sales, demand for our components used in medical equipment, such as ventilators, x-ray systems, sterilization equipment, personal protective equipment all increased as a result of the outbreak. The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services. The outbreak has caused significant volatility and substantial decline in value across global economic markets. Most notably, the commercial aerospace industry has experienced an ongoing substantial decline in demand. As such, our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry have been materially impacted by the significant decline in global commercial air travel that began in March 2020. Once commercial air travel resumes, cost savings will most likely be a priority for our commercial aviation customers. And we do anticipate recovery in demand for our commercial aviation products, which frequently provide aircraft operators with significant cost savings. Furthermore, we believe that our cost-saving solutions and robust product development programs will enable us to potentially increase market share and emerge with a stronger presence within this market. Consolidated net income increased 22% to a record $197.3 million, or $1.44 per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $161.1 million, or $1.18 per diluted share in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Consolidated operating income increased 1% to $219.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $217.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Our consolidated operating margin improved to 22.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from 22.1% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Cash flow provided by operating activities was strong increasing 15% to $205.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $178.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $393.4 million as of April 30, compared to shareholders' equity ratio decreased to 20.8% as of April 30, 2020, and that was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Net debt to EBITDA ratio decreased to 0.72 times as of April 30, 2020 and that was down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we successfully completed two acquisitions and we have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share decreased 8% to $0.55 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 22% to $1.44 in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $1.18 in the first six months of fiscal 2019. That increase principally reflects an incremental discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $20.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and totaled $43.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up slightly from $40.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Research and development expense was $16.8 million in both the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and increased 6% to $33.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $32 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies as we continue to invest between -- of each sales dollar into new product development. Our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased by 22% to 20 points -- to $70 million [ph] in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $90.2 million second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our consolidated SG&A expenses decreased by 10% to $157.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $174.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance-based compensation expense and reductions in expenses including outside sales, commissions, marketing and travel, partially offset by the impact from the fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was down from 17.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. That decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance-based compensation expense partially offset by some inefficiencies resulting from the overall impacts of the outbreak. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was down from 17.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2020 principally reflects lower performance based compensation expenses. Interest expense decreased to $3.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was down from $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. And it decreased to $8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 down from $11 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 was principally due to a lower weighted interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the second quarter in six -- first six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019 was not significant. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 22.6% as compared to 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Our effective tax rate in the first six months of fiscal 2020 was 0.3% compared to 14.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019. And this accounted for the majority of the decrease in our year-to-date effective rate. The larger benefit from stock option exercise recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was the result of more stock options exercised as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the optionees' holding period. The majority of options exercised, which generated this cash windfall for HEICO were approaching their 10-year expiration dates. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests were $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $8.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $13.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that compared to $17 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 principally, reflects the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019, which effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries back to HEICO's Flight Support Group. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remains very strong. As I previously discussed, cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong increasing 15% to $205.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $178.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Our working capital ratio improved to 4.4 times as of April 30 as compared to 2.8 as October 31, 2019. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 44 days as of April 30, 2020 compared to 45 days compared to April 30, 2019. Of course, we continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales and our top five customers represented approximately 24% and 21% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our inventory rate increased to 139 days for the period ending April 30, 2020 and that compared to 126 days for the period ended April 30, 2019. The increase in the turnover rate reflects certain inventory purchase commitments based on pre-outbreak net sales expectations and also to support the backlog of certain of our businesses. Now let's talk about the outlook. Our results of operation for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 have been affected by the outbreak. In our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period January -- ending January 31, 2020 we provided financial guidance for fiscal 2020, but noted that it excluded any impact from the coronavirus outbreak because it was such an early stage. As noted within our Form 8-K filed on April 15, 2020 we withdrew our fiscal 2020 financial guidance due to the recent developments pertaining to the impact from the outbreak. HEICO entered the outbreak with a healthy balance sheet that included strong cash position and nominal debt. We cannot estimate the duration and magnitude of the outbreak and cannot confidently predict when demand for our commercial aerospace products will return to pre-outbreak levels. However, we believe that HEICO is favorably positioned for long-term success despite the short-term challenges created by the outbreak in the global economy. Our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring and operating high cash-generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aerospace such as defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics and medical puts us in a good financial position to weather this period of economic uncertainty. Accordingly, we continue to forecast positive cash flow from operations for the remainder of fiscal 2020. I would like to end by thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team is focused on your safety and your professional success. We will exit this outbreak stronger than before. That strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, our mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding our customers' expectations and we thank all of our team members for all of the things you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I would also like to point out that HEICO's Executive team has gone through at least three, four, maybe five situations similar to this COVID-19 outbreak. We went through the 9/11, we went through SARS, we went through the 2008 financial collapse, and in every event HEICO came back stronger and more profitable than before. I am completely confident and our management team is completely confident that we will again repeat this performance. So, again thank you all. And now we can open the floor for questions. Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for the question, Larry. So the receivables are actually very high quality right now. We did a good job on collections during the quarter. And as you can see from the press release, receivables are down as a source of cash for us. So that was very good. The aging has not deteriorated. I mean, candidly, I am worried about airline bankruptcies and that impact on our receivables. We don't tend to have high concentrations within any one airline or any what I'll call significant exposures. But for the health of the industry, I do worry about that and we'll see how that plays out over the next three to six months. As far as the draw, you're correct, we took a draw in March and I did that preemptively to make sure that if the banks, for whatever reason, seized up, as we saw back in the financial crisis that HEICO wasn't at the mercy of the banks in the case, where we needed to draw on the line for an acquisition or for whatever capital needs we had. And so, I took the draw in a proactive state. You could see we didn't use it. We have about close to $350 million sitting on the balance sheet right now. And my carrying cost for that is so low, that I'm going to let it sit there for a while. And if we use it for acquisitions, great. If not, we'll just repay the line with it. Good morning The acquisition pipe, we are looking. We're doing due diligence on a number of companies. Again, earlier I commented on acquisitions and it's more difficult because of logistics issues getting out doing the due diligence. We do a very thorough due diligence. We go out to factories we look at, how they're manufacturing, what their manufacturing processes are. In addition to financial, we study the markets. And so we do a very thorough due diligence process. It's more difficult because, we can't get out to the sites as easily because of the COVID. But again, we have a great appetite. Our appetite for acquisition has not changed at all. And as a matter of fact we're cautiously optimistic that we will see some opportunities. Maybe people will be willing to sell at prices that match our strategy because we don't pay 14 or 12 times EBITDA. And we're hoping that, some of the competition that we used to get from private equity might be less because of the -- their -- private equities' less ability to raise funds in this environment. We have plenty of availability capital. We're not capital constrained. We have very low debt level. So, we are aggressively looking for acquisitions. Now saying that, many companies have seen particularly in the aerospace side have seen their revenues drop. And we normally do not pay prices based upon future promises. We want companies that will carry their weight, generate cash flow, generate the margins that we demand at HEICO. So our discipline has not changed and we will never want to grow just to be bigger. We only will grow to be more cash flow positive. So, I think the opportunities are out there. I think over the next six months or a year, I would think we will see more opportunities. And we're open for business. We'd like to make as many good transactions as we can. No I think it's all -- it's pretty much the same. The mix is pretty much the same. We look at large ones. We look at smaller ones. We -- again the key for us is not big. The key -- investment bankers come to us and they bring us deals where there's 7% or 11% operating margins they're big. But we're not interested in big. We want cash flow. So we want 20% 30% operating margins that really earn their keep with great entrepreneurial management. Just to be big HEICO is not a company that wants to grow to just be big. We will always grow to be cash flow big. That's where we want to be big. And so, the size of the company is not nearly as important as the profitability and the cash flow. Thank you, Ken. Josh, this is Larry. Just to add to what Victor said, I agree completely. To simplify it, you think of the carrot and a stick. So in a decentralized company as HEICO is, we would much prefer the carrot than the stick. And all of the business unit managers and presidents of the companies are incentivized to a very high degree to produce good results. They are also basically entrepreneurial when we acquired the company as Victor told you. So by incentivizing them to do the right thing, we don't have to hit them with a stick. These guys are really, really smart operators. They are terrific. So that's the benefit that we get running a highly decentralized company. Now they report to us. We know what they're doing. We get financial reports weekly, but these people are known entities and they know exactly what to do. We have a group, I would say, what doesn't show up in the financial statement is the brilliance of the managers that we have running these companies. So I think that's at the heart of it. Okay. So Josh, are you still there? I'm sorry there's something -- we must have had a power failure here and the system went down and just disconnected. Did you get? Were you satisfied with -- did you get the whole answer? Okay. Let me answer \u2013 this is Larry. We will look at those kinds of companies depending upon what we think their ultimate profitability will be. So the answer is yes. We are inclined not to pay up for pie in the sky in the future. But there are some companies that we know of now that we're looking at that meet those kind of qualifications that you just mentioned. We'll have to see how they work out? What the price is if they're for sale? So -- yeah, but we would consider, -- so the answer to your question is, yes. Yeah. So I think what you're referring to in the 2014-2015 time, was the reason our sales were lower then was because we had something like -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but something like 22% organic growth in the year or two before that. So I think what happened was a lot of equipment got deferred. There was a lot of deferred maintenance there was massive sales. We way outperformed in the period before. So then it slowed down a little bit, in that period. I think that's probably the thing that drove the lower sales growth in the 2014, 2015 time frame. Yeah. We think that -- I mean look, there's no question that it is hard to find those types of businesses over on the FSG side. I would say more often than not we're probably lower than that, in terms of margins. And then through our ability to increase the sales and to increase the profitability of the business going forward, we get it closer up to our area. But I would say, the 20% is something that we like to be. Sometimes we're able to find a business that's over 20%. But I wouldn't say that, that is a walk away point. If we see a very realistic path, then we could start with something that's below that number. Just to clarify I will not go for a company that has a very low margin, unless it's a bolt-on acquisition where we know. So if we buy a company, we bought loss companies at within FSG. We have purchased loss companies and within three months they have become big profit makers. Why? Because we strip that -- we moved the location, we closed the factory, and we merge it into one of our other operations. And then all of a sudden it goes from -- they could be a loss to over 20%. Keep in mind, we're looking for -- remember this because I don't know if you keep this in mind, when you write your reports. We are looking for constant cash flow and growth. That's what HEICO is all about. We get aerospace electronic technologies, whatever. HEICO is a vehicle to generate cash flow. And we do it through those two divisions which normally have high margins. And I think if you understand that, you'll understand HEICO better. Well, the management team in HEICO wants to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. We are available at any time. If you have other questions, you're welcome to call me, Carlos, Eric, Victor and if we can clarify anything and we're happy to discuss it. And otherwise, we look forward to speaking to you after the third quarter announcement. And that call will be sometime, I guess, in the middle of August, the end of August. So thank you all and please stay safe and healthy during this COVID epidemic. This concludes the call."

            "content": "Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales decreased 18% to $252 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $308.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's net sales decreased 7% to $553.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, as compared to $595.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The net sales decrease in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020 is principally organic and reflects lower demand across all of our product lines resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel beginning in March 2020 due to the outbreak. The Flight Support Group's operating income decreased 24% to $47.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to $62.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Flight Support Group's operating income decreased 5% to $109.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2020, as compared to $115 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The operating income decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2020, principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales and a lower gross profit margin mainly within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts in products -- service product lines partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin decreased to 18.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 20.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned lower performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 19.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2020, up from 19.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from lower performance based compensation expense partially offset by the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the Electronic Technologies Group results. Thank you, Rob. That's a very good question and we've spent a lot of time internally thinking about that and looking at what happened. Basically February was an outstanding month. It was a short month but had it been the length of the other months it probably would have been a record month for us. And we entered March very strong. I would say that March overall was quite decent. It did start coming off in the second half of the month, but still we were able to hold our own in March. April was the point where we really started to get impacted. And of course, we still had some backlog that was preordered before the month began so April started coming down. And you can see the results where they are now. I think we are hopeful that May is probably the bottom of the crisis. It's very hard to say that with all certainty. May has not concluded yet. We're starting to get June orders. Remember, we get most of our orders in the month of shipment. So, it's very hard to have visibility. But as we can see as enthusiasm in the country starts improving as therapeutics or vaccines look like they're coming along and people are getting more comfortable with the idea of traveling we think that it should be up from here. That would really be our internal guess. If you want to get into the numbers, we've stress tested our sales and earnings to make sure that we can withstand whatever may come our way. And we believe that within the Flight Support Group based on the current expense levels that we can sustain a drop of sales in Flight Support in the 50% to 60% area and still breakeven. Now, that 50% to 60% drop in Flight Support sales would imply probably a 70% to 80% drop in the aftermarket. But with all of the business units we've run those numbers, we understand what that is. And when I say breakeven at 50% to 60% down that is after writing off all of the inefficiencies and the under-absorbed overheads that would end up getting incurred in a reduced volume environment. I would agree with that. And I've been on the calls where people have suggested those numbers. We think the $5,000 mark is probably a good number. I can tell you that less than -- and we have not disclosed this in the past due to competitive reasons but based on where we are in the cycle and the crisis, I think it's something which is reasonable to speak about now that only less than 10% of our PMA sales have -- less than 10% of our PMA sales volume is driven by parts that cost over $5,000. So, therefore, we believe that our focus on the type of products that we've done would tend to not lend themselves to as much cannibalization as a result of used serviceable material. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, Peter, that's a great question. What we see right now the initial impact of course is if the airlines aren't flying the aircraft they don't need the parts. And they need to burn off their inventories and we've been through various examples of how destocking works. But basically if an airline is using let's just say 100 units of a particular widget before the crisis and they wanted to maintain let's just say three months of inventory on hand that would be 300 units. If due to consumption the demand hypothetically falls 50%, then they would only be using 50 units. And if they wanted the whole three months of inventory and of course in some cases they want to hold less due to the financial impact that they are suffering right now, they would only need 150 pieces. So therefore, if they had 300 on the shelf, they only need 150. They're going to have to burn through 150 pieces before they place those orders. So I think that's the initial impact that everybody in the industry is seeing. Then you've got a further breakout in the economy between components and engines. So we believe that the sales of component overhaul, component parts is going to be fairly linear to number of flights or available seat miles, because airlines typically are not going to remove a serviceable component from a serviceable airplane and stick it on another aircraft and then end up with an unserviceable airplane that they just cannibalized. So we think that the sales of component overhaul and component parts will come back first. We believe that the engines will be more impacted and that airlines will figure out how to not induct engines and not either swap them off aircraft that have good engines as needed or just delay the engines going into the shop. And then of course heavy maintenance is the last part. So roughly two-thirds of our PMA sales are in the component area. And we expect that that is going to come back before the engines and the heavy maintenance. Now how does -- your question was on retirements. So airlines have obviously faced with a dilemma. Do they continue to fly the existing equipment or do they go ahead and take deliveries? We could have a whole debate on this. Our belief is that in areas where airlines are going to lose significant deposits, they're going to take those deliveries. But by and large, they're going to defer the maintenance on the planes that require the most dollars to be able to fly, but that it will make sense to go ahead and make that equipment serviceable before they take deliveries of new aircraft. And I'm not saying that deliveries of new aircraft is going to shut off, it's not, but we think that that's going to be more seriously impacted. So that's sort of how we look at the market. Yes. I think the -- Larry this is Eric. As you said, as the aircraft come out of warranty, they really come into our sweet spot. There's all debate over what's going to be permanently retired and what's going to be temporarily retired. I think that there's a fair amount of optimism that a lot of equipment does go back into service. Of course, there's been a delay in the production of new equipment and of course the bill rates have been reduced. So again, we're optimistic because even if you assume an aggressive retirement schedule. You've still got all of the other equipment aging one year per year. The fleet is approximately 25,000 aircraft. So even if a chunk of aircraft come out then -- so be if they will, we don't think we're going to be hit as a result of cannibalization that badly. And yes, there will be a short-term impact. But we think that as the lion share of the aircraft that remain in service age that that will provide plenty of opportunity for us in terms of our sales whether it's parts or repairs. Yes. It's something that we are capable of doing. We've done a very thorough review of our new product development pipeline, wanting to make sure that everything that we've -- that we're spending money on and that we're going to develop and source, that in fact there is going to be a need for us. So we've gone ahead and done that. At this moment, we haven't increased the amount of new product development, but we're basically holding it roughly steady and consistent with prior years, because we want to make sure that we're able to support the airlines coming out of this crisis. And we think we're going to be in a very good position to be able to support the airlines. And I know that this is sort of my perspective and as a result of my involvement with HEICO. But I really do believe that, it's important that people not conflate the growth of PMA with the growth of HEICO, in that, I think, airlines look at HEICO. HEICO is a $10 billion market cap company. We're a respected and serious industry participant. All of the major companies are aware of us. And as I've said many times, the PMA industry is not an easy business to be in. It's very difficult and we have to fight for every single piece of business that we have. So I'd be very careful about making a statement -- and I don't mean you, but I mean people, in general, making a statement that PMA is going to do very well coming out of this crisis. I have a lot of confidence that HEICO is going to be able to do very well, coming out of this crisis, because of the products that we offer and our financial stability. Looking at other companies, I'm not so sure. I think that they're going to have a lot of -- they're going to have a lot of pressure. If you look at other companies, sort of, how they've done over a longer period of time. The PMA space has not been very good for them. So I think our model of continuing to develop new parts and making sure that we take care of the customers and we're very fair on pricing, I think, really wins us a lot of friends. And for that reason, I'm very optimistic on our future. Yes. I do feel that our market share is going to continue to go up. Our market share in PMA was already high, but it's even gone higher. And I anticipate that's going to continue. Good morning. Yes, that's a great question. In the past, in order to sort of keep things simple, we used to say that the greatest proxy for the aftermarket was really available seat miles. Ultimately, passenger seat miles would impact available seat miles, but available seat miles were really the driver. And as we got into this crisis, we realized, yes, I mean, obviously, that's important. But just the number of flights is also very important. Most of our sales have always been on the narrow-body product. So wide-body is what's obviously most impacted right now or even more impacted than narrow-body. And most of our sales are over on the narrow-body. So, I would say number of flights is probably the highest correlated to the aftermarket right now and the thing that we're really looking at. But remember, the other issue that you've got as I mentioned earlier was the destocking phenomenon. And that is extremely sharp and extremely painful in the beginning because, everybody's got to burn off their inventory. And until that happens, it's very hard to see a rebound. But I would say that's probably the big driver for us the number of flights. I don't have that with me, but I'm guessing that the 75-25 is probably a good guess on what it is. It sometimes can get a little complicated because some of the components can go on a narrow-body aircraft as well as a wide-body aircraft. So you have to make all sorts of assumptions. But I would say yes, the 75% narrow-body is probably a good rough approximation of it. Yes. Ken that's a very good question. I know you've been writing about this topic and very much focused on it which I think is very good. My personal belief is that airlines are not going to induct engines until they absolutely have to. So I think that that is again the last thing to come back. I think there'll be heavy maintenance. I don't think there are going to be many to induct heavy maintenance until they absolutely have to. And with engines I think they're going to wait. So how much longer that is from components. I think it's really on very much a case-by-case basis. But I'm guessing that it could be six months delayed from when the components come in. But it's really \u2013 it's something that we're going to have to look at depending on the particular engine type and the airline that is operating it. But I definitely expect them to really want to conserve cash. And of course, engines that need a lot of life-limited parts, those it goes without saying are really going to be at the end of the line. And I think those are the \u2013 as a part of the aftermarket that's really going to experience the most short-term and perhaps intermediate term pain. And those will end up getting overhauled but I think that's just further down the line. I think, yes. I think definitely the airlines are going to manage the green time very effectively. There are also lessors out there, who are being very creative and very innovative on buying up engines with green time, buying up aircraft taking off the engines to the point where the engines don't have to be overhauled as much. And there are lessors out there, who recognize that what airlines care about is thrust. They want safe thrust. And I think a number of OEMs have gotten away with conflating their sales of spare parts with the quality or the aftermarket demand for the remarketability of those engines. And we've seen lessors go out there and recognize that airlines are just as happy to operate engines which have alternative material in them. And the airlines are able to achieve savings, the lessors are able to make money. So I do think that engines that have more OEM material and require more of the life-limited parts are going to be delayed. And definitely the green time engines are going to be used first. Yes. Absolutely, Ken. We believe that there is a lot of opportunity for us in those markets. Those discussions were actually occurring before the COVID crisis. They had really picked up in the months before COVID. And now with the airlines being really behind the eight ball, we anticipate, I think really for HEICO and that goes to my earlier comment in that HEICO is recognized as a serious industry player with a $10-plus billion market cap and we're able to stand behind these products. So I think that we are going to disproportionately benefit on the rebound. And I think these airlines are going to see the opportunity that a HEICO solution can give them. So yes, I do anticipate us being able to sort of mitigate the downturn and pick up market share as a result of picking up some of these customers where we didn't do as much with them in the past. Thank you. Good morning, Josh. Sure Sheila, that's a good question. And I've been reading your material throughout the whole crisis. I found it very interesting with the -- a lot of the data that you've had in there. I think the big driver is going to be the aircraft that need first heavy maintenance and then engine maintenance. And I think that's going to be the driver before the age. In other words, if you could have hypothetically an 18-year-old aircraft that needs a lot of money to be put in it in order to fly whereas you just overhauled a 24-year old aircraft and you're going to end up deciding to fly the 24-year old aircraft because from a cash perspective, you don't need to put money in it. So I think it's going to be very much based on an airline by airline, fleet by fleet aircraft serial number by serial member as they figure out which aircraft they're going to use. But we are in the process -- we're part of a study whereby, we've got somebody looking into this for us to be able to determine what areas are going to be impacted the most and basically come back online. So I think that's really how we look at it more on a cash-in basis as opposed to a straight age basis. Now having said that, if you've got two aircrafts hypothetically and they both need the same number of dollars to be made viable then obviously to the extent you own both of them then you would pick obviously the younger one because you would have a longer life in that. However, I think a lot of this gets very complicated because it depends what's leased, what airlines are able to give back, what's owned, what's fully depreciated. And it's a fairly complicated calculation. So I don't think it's going to be a one size fits all. approach. Yes that's a good question Sheila. Let me start with the second part of the question. We have done layoffs we -- our number one asset is our people. So we've been very careful to try to impact our people the least as possible. Having said that, with the current reality and the reduced level of business, we've had to make some adjustments, so we have done layoffs, we have done furloughs, we have done voluntary programs where people are not working one or two days a week. And then we've also done wage -- temporary wage reductions which we've all taken in order to be able to pitch it. When you put all of that together, we've calculated that our breakeven on FSG is, we can withstand a drop of 50% to 60% in total sales. And if you assume roughly that FSG is approximately 80% aftermarket and let's just say, the aftermarket is down pick a number 70% then that implies basically a 70% to 80% drop in the aftermarket. We think that initially the drop in the OEM sales, initially coming out of the chute wasn't as much because they have certain amount on order, but that is going to start to kick in. So we anticipate again aftermarket down sharply, but OEM not down as much but that reduction is going to last longer than the aftermarket because we anticipate the aftermarket is going to come back first. So I would say that's sort of how do we look at it. Thank you, Sheila. Yes. So Mike, this is Eric and that's a great question. We have to be careful because we have withdrawn guidance because we truly don't know what the numbers are going to be. We've seen the impact thus far. We see that airlines are not flying. We care about our people. As I said number one, it's about our people. And so we obviously had to reduce our cost structure to be able to live with this new reality, but we want to make sure that we're able in terms of new product development, developing new stuff, as well as maintaining our sales force and maintaining the leadership in our businesses that we are able to respond. So that's why we're providing this, if you will a framework that FSG can be down 50% to 60% in revenue and still breakeven. It does -- as that revenue falls we do approach more of the breakeven area. And the reason we give the range of 50% to 60% is it depends very much on mix. But the other thing which is very important to note is that, we've always had -- this has gone back 30 years. We've always had an extremely conservative accounting model and accounting standards. One of the old tricks in manufacturing is that, when volumes fall one of the ways that companies can delay taking the pain is basically by increasing cost in pulling in the block costs that ends up getting amortized or increasing the standard costing of products going forward. We're very careful to not do that. So we write-off, when we have excess manufacturing costs and underutilized overhead, we're very careful to write that off. So we don't have future pain. So when I say that, our numbers are down, you can withstand a drop of 50%, 60% and still breakeven that's after taking all of the inventory reserves and writing off all of the excess manufacturing costs and not putting them into inventory, not putting them into fixed assets, and not doing things that we think are really \u2013 would penalize the long term. We want our businesses to understand very clearly, how they're doing in the short term. And if companies play around, and they play games, and they end up reporting higher short-term profits in order to delay the pain, then that just confuses the team members on really where you stand. So I hope that, gives you a little bit of idea or color into how we're thinking about this. We have \u2013 but it becomes honestly very complicated to build the revenue model based on that. We do look at it. But Carlos, we'll let him comment on our accounts receivable process, but we are careful with regard to companies that are at risk of filing for insolvency or bankruptcy. And yes, we do get stung and we like to make sure that we're supporting our customers, but we want to do so in an intelligent way, and Carlos can expand on that. Good morning. No. I think -- to clarify what I meant or what I said or what I meant to say, was that we typically don't get on a new airplane, until it doesn't have meaningful revenue to us until 10 years after the first delivery. But not 10 years after each aircraft is delivered. And it's probably shorter than that maybe its seven years or something like that. I would say that's the case more on the PMA and the repair side. On the distribution side we would be on it, right away. We'd be on it immediately. And of course in the specialty products, we would occur -- we would achieve revenue, even before it's delivered. So to put a little bit of color into that thought."

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2020 First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn this conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Laurans Mendelson. Please go ahead, sir.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and welcome you to HEICO\u2019s First Quarter and Fiscal 2020 Earnings Teleconference. I\u2019m Larry Mendelson, I\u2019m, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I\u2019m joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO\u2019s talented team members who, again, were responsible for our strong results. I am truly proud of this dedicated loyal group, and they are the ones that continue to produce the highest quality products and services for our customers while maintaining our unique entrepreneurial culture and delivering outstanding returns to shareholders. I\u2019d like to summarize the highlights of our first quarter results. Consolidated net income increased 54% to $121.9 million or $0.89 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $79.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were both favorably impacted by a discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was approximately $46.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively. These tax benefits were mainly driven by more stock options being exercised as they approach expiration as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO\u2019s stock price during the optionees\u2019 holding period. And the next comment, I think, is very critical because the tax benefit and the increase in taxes can be a little bit confusing to normal operating earnings. So I want to point out that excluding the impact of tax benefit in both periods, 2019 and 2020, net income and diluted earnings per share increased 18% and 17%, respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And I think that\u2019s an amazing accomplishment that I credit our great team members with producing those results. And to me, that should be the clearest message that we send in this entire report. Consolidated operating income increased 13% to $111 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $97.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated operating margin improved to 21.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 21% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated net sales increased 9% to $506.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $466.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In summary, our consolidated first quarter 2020 net sales increased 9%. Our operating income increased 13%. And our net income, excluding the stock option impact, increased 18%, and we are all very pleased with these results, and we hope all of our shareholders are, too. Our ETG group\u2019s net sales and operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 are up 13% and 11%, respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Those increases reflect the impact from our very well-managed and profitable fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions as well as strong double-digit organic growth for our defense products. Our Flight Support Group net sales and operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 are up 5% and 17%, respectively, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Those reflect organic growth within all of our product lines as well as improved gross profit margins. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 64% to a strong $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast very strong cash flow from operations for the balance of fiscal 2020. We also continue to generate significant cash flow for our shareholders by remaining focused on developing niche products and our strategic commitment to an entrepreneurial structure that minimizes bureaucracy and focuses team members on serving our customers. Our total debt to shareholders\u2019 equity decreased to 31.4% as of January 31, 2020, down from 33.2% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt, which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $504.8 million as of January 31, 2020 to shareholders\u2019 equity ratio decreased to 27.9% as of January 31, 2020, and that was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our Net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.9 times as of January 31, 2020, and that was down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. We are not a financially challenged company. We have major firepower behind the line to do really anything that we want to do, and we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions, and of course, our standard R&D development. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023. And we plan to utilize our financial flexibility, again, to pursue those high-quality acquisitions and maximize shareholder returns. In January 2020, we paid an increased regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which represented our 83rd consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979, and it was a 14% increase over the prior semiannual per share amount. In December 2019, our Radiant Power subsidiary acquired 100% of the business and assets of the human machine interface, or product line of Spectralux, HMI designs, manufactures, repairs, light deck, annunciators, panels, indicators and illuminated keyboards as well as lighting controls and flight deck lighting. Radiant Power is part of our ETG group, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In December 19, 2019, we acquired 80.1% of the stock of Quell Corporation, which designs and manufactures EMI, RFI and transient protection solutions who are a very wide variety of connector products in aerospace and defense. The acquisition successfully closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and has integrated well into our ETG group. And we expect that acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In January 2020, we reported that our 3D-Plus subsidiary supplied numerous mission-critical and highly reliability components on the Solar Orbiter space mission. That mission will provide the first views of the sun\u2019s unchartered polar regions and investigate how intense radiation and energetic particles being blasted out from the sun and carried by the solar wind through the solar system will impact our home planet earth. We congratulate the European Space Agency on leading this project along with its partners at NASA, Airbus, 3D-Plus and the numerous other contributors to this effort. HEICO takes pride in 3D-Plus\u2019 involvement in this historic mission. Now at this time, I\u2019d like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, and thank you. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales increased 5% to $301.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $287.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to 4% organic growth, mainly due to increased demand and new product offerings across all of our product line. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income increased 17% to $62 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $52.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. I\u2019d like to point out that our team members are incentivized and focused on operating income, not sales. And I consider a near 17% organic increase in operating income to be a phenomenal achievement, especially since it was accomplished while maintaining our long-term minimal price increase model and keeping the loyalty and appreciation of our customers. The increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly attributable to a more favorable product mix within all of our product lines. The previously mentioned net sales growth and a favorable impact from lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin increased to 20.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 18.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Again, this was accomplished by maintaining our low-price increase model. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from efficiencies realized from the net sales growth as well as the previously mentioned lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. With respect to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we continue to estimate 7% to 8% net sales growth over the prior year, and now estimate the full year Flight Support Group operating margin to approximate 15%, up from the prior operating margin estimate of 19.5% to 20%. Further, we continue to estimate mid- to single \u2013 mid- to high single-digit organic growth in fiscal 2020. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses and the impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak, if any. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales increased 13% to $208.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from a $184.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions as well as 6% organic growth, mainly due to increased demand for our defense products, partially offset by lower sales for some of our space products, which was within our planning and expectations in the first quarter and which we expect to level up during the balance of the year. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income increased 11% to $57.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $51.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly due to a decrease in the previously mentioned net sales of our space products, partially offset by the increased net sales of our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 27.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to 28% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is mainly due to the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG& A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly due to a decrease in performance-based compensation expense as well as efficiencies realized from the net sales growth. With respect to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we now estimate approximately 6% to 7% net sales growth over the prior year, up from our prior estimate of 5% to 6%, and continue to anticipate the full year Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin to approximate 28% to 29%. Further, we continue to estimate mid-to- low single-digit organic growth in fiscal 2020. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses and the impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak, if any. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 53% to $0.89 from the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $0.58 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As previously mentioned, the increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the discrete tax benefit, net of non-controlling interest from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Excluding, again, I repeat, excluding the impact of tax benefits in both periods, the 18% increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the strong performance within the both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies Group. Somehow or other, I think a number of analysts kind of missed that, and I want to \u2013 would like to point that out to them because some analysts didn\u2019t mention this in their report, and I think it\u2019s a very important item for shareholders to focus on. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And the increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased 13% to $17.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $15.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Flight Support and ETG as we continue to invest approximately 3% of each sales dollar in new product development. SG&A, consolidated expenses increased and principally reflects the impact of our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions, partially offset by lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. Carlos can explain the details to you later on if you want to know that. Consolidated SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 17.2% in the first quarter and that was down \u2013 fourth quarter of 2020, down from 18.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. That, of course, is a very positive change. And that decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is mainly due to efficiencies, which we realized from net sales growth, the previously mentioned lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense as a percentage of net sales. Interest expense decreased to $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down from $5.5 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and that was \u2013 decrease was due mainly to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreements. Other income and expense in both years was not significant. HEICO incurred an income tax benefit of $22.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $4.1 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. We recognized the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 up $47.6 million and $16.6 million respectively. The larger benefit from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was the result of more stock options being exercised as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO\u2019s stock price during the optionees\u2019 holding period. The majority of the options exercised which generated this cash windfall for HEICO were approaching their 10-year expiration date. I have a personal comment, which I\u2019ll mention. According to the accounting rules, we do not \u2013 are not permitted to accrue those increases over the approximately 10 years that those options were vesting. Had we accrued them year by year, we wouldn\u2019t have had this big windfall all in one year. In my personal opinion, and I don\u2019t run the Accounting Board, they should make a change and permit companies to adjust those items to fair market on an annual basis, and that would eliminate a little bit of the confusion that folks seem to have with this \u2013 all of a sudden, this one windfall all at one moment. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 down from $8.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and that decrease principally reflects the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019 that effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries and back to the HEICO Flight Support Group. And that was partially offset by improved operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG, in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full fiscal year 2020, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate of approximately 19% to 20% of pretax income. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very, very strong, increasing 64% to $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 up from $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our working capital ratio improved to 3.4 times as of January 31, 2020, compared to 2.8 times as of October 31, 2019. Our day \u2013 DSOs or day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 46 days as of January 31, 2020. And that compared to 47 days as of January 31, 2019. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit exposure. We have very little loss in accounts receivable historically. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top five customers represented approximately 22% and 20% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, respectively. Inventory turnover rate of 132 days as of January 31 was the same as the rate for the period January 31, 2019. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we anticipate continued net sales growth within Flight Support, commercial aviation and defense product lines. We also anticipate growth within ETG, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. During fiscal 2020, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and aggressive acquisition strategy, while at the same time, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. Based upon our current economic visibility, we now estimate 14% to 15% growth in full year net income, and that was up from our prior growth estimate of 13% to 14%. And we continue to estimate approximately 6% to 8% growth in full year net sales over fiscal 2019. In addition, we continue to anticipate our fiscal 2020 consolidated operating margin to approximate 21.5% to 22%. Depreciation and amortization expense of about $89 million. CapEx approximate $42 million and cash flow from operations to approximate $475 million. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any. They also exclude any potential impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak as the impact to our business is uncertain and difficult to predict. In closing, we intend to continue to focus on intermediate and long-term growth strategies with a laser focus on growing our earnings and cash flow while executing our disciplined acquisition strategy of acquiring profitable businesses at fair prices. All of this is made possible by the dedication and hard work of our 65 \u2013 approximately 6,500 team members worldwide that continue to exceed customer expectations and deliver these outstanding results. Again, HEICO\u2019s management team thanks them for making their company a success. And I want to emphasize that their company because we consider the team members as the ones who really make it happen and they look upon HEICO as their company, and we believe that is the culture that makes our success possible. With that, those are the extent of my \u2013 our prepared remarks, and we\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: I think, I\u2019ll start, Eric, on your side and talk about these margins, the margin strength you talked about earlier. I mean, I think the incremental margin, 66%, if I\u2019m doing the math right, and you did raise the guide and talked about the mix. Could you give us a little more color on what is happening with the mix there?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would be happy to, Rob, good morning. As you know, and I think most of our shareholders know, our team members and our leadership are incentivized and focused on operating income. We try to keep things very simple. And they\u2019re not focused on revenue. They don\u2019t get compensated on revenue, they get compensated on earnings. So I think what we continue to see is a shift where we deemphasize lower-margin products, and we focus more on higher-margin products. And I think that really is the driver of the improvement in the operating income that we\u2019ve seen. And I\u2019m particularly happy, as I mentioned in my comments, that we were able to drive this increase in margin without alienating our customers. We continue to maintain a very low price increase model. So we make sure that our customers appreciate us. And that they want to come back and want \u2013 we\u2019re the vendor of choice and they want to develop more items with us. So I\u2019m very happy that we were able to accomplish that by focusing on these new products and increasing the margin. The margin increase wasn\u2019t in any one particular area. I would say that it was very broad-based and consistent with basically how we operate the company.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just switching to the topic that was brought up earlier. I know coronavirus is tough to \u2013 we don\u2019t know how this is going to play out. You don\u2019t have it in the guide. But have you seen any evidence yet of a slowdown in your spare parts demand either in the late part of the first quarter or even early here in the beginning of the second quarter?\nEric Mendelson: No, actually, so far, and I\u2019ve gotten reports as late as this morning, we have not seen any material change in our orders or delivery. We are watching a few customers, and I don\u2019t want to mention which customer names, but a few customers that have been reported in the press as having some financial challenges. So we just want to make sure that we do the intelligent thing. We\u2019ll make sure that we take care of them and continue to support them. But in a sense, I think the timing for HEICO is fairly good because, as you know, February 1 was the start of our second quarter, so we\u2019re now going to be able to have another two months before we report to be able to see what the impact is. But we\u2019re watching this very closely. There has not been a change to date. I mean, clearly, in my opinion, this will impact the industry. There\u2019s no question that this will impact demand. But it is so difficult to estimate at this point, especially given the strong order pattern that we\u2019ve seen to date that we just think that it would be irresponsible for us to, if you will, take a flag at what it could be. It really depends on what happens with the virus and what continues to happen with air travel. But meanwhile, our people are very much focused on their supply chains as well as their customers. And we\u2019re, of course, keeping our ear to the ground on that.\nRobert Spingarn: And just on that, I think your 10-K says that outside of the U.S., no country, no single country accounts for more than 10% of total company sales, but is there any way to calibrate how much FSG sells into the Asia-Pacific region?\nCarlos Macau: Rob, this is Carlos. You\u2019re right. We don\u2019t disclose that specifically. I will tell you that consolidated because something like this doesn\u2019t just affect the Flight Support Group, it can have impacts on the ETG also. So when you think about it on a consolidated basis, our sales into Asia, in particular, the Chinese areas are in the low single digits. We\u2019re not dependent on that market. In fact, we\u2019ve stated before that that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us in the future. And I just want to emphasize another thing because it may be the next question you pose on the supply chain side of things. One of the benefits that I guess, HEICO is enjoying right now is that when Trump, President Trump put his tariffs on China, a lot of our guys that were sourcing product from that region had to find alternatives. And so \u2013 or at least look for second sources. And so right now, as product is not moving out of China as quickly, we do have backup plans, and our guys are executing on that, so that it\u2019s not as dramatic of an impact to the company.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you. And then just quickly, Victor, on your side. I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the extra strength in defense and then some of the headwinds in space, which I think you said will reverse over time. And it looks like this might have had a slight impact on the margin?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. That definitely did. We were expecting that in our budgets and in our planning, with orders picking up as the year wears on, it was just programmatic and timing of when programs are hitting and when orders are shipping, and we\u2019re still expecting that more in the back half of the year. I would say, still back half, not first half, but back half.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, great. Thank you, all.\nEric Mendelson: By the way, Rob. This is Eric. Just to finish up on one thing, just to add on what Carlos was saying. I met with our heads of sales last week to do an in-depth review on any potential impact as a result of the coronavirus. And I can tell you, while I don\u2019t want to go into information on specific regions, countries, airlines or products, I can tell you that there is a significant increase in our cost-saving solutions at a number of customers. And our sales VPs have speculated that a part of this may be due to the coronavirus, and that they are getting very serious. We\u2019ve seen historically whenever there is a supply-demand imbalance that our customers become a lot more focused on cost-saving opportunities. So we have definitely seen that. Again, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 due to competitive reasons, and I welcome our competitors on this call, I can\u2019t get into what regions, what customers, what type of products, but there has been a definite increase in interest. And where I would say we\u2019re hopeful that it will turn into something good for HEICO.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks for the extra color on the market share.\nVictor Mendelson: This is Victor. I\u2019ll just make one other comment on COVID-19, which is \u2013 I think people are expecting this to spread beyond Asia and beyond China. And nobody knows where and how that will play out. But ultimately, it gets under control. And it will, over some period of time, affect different places and different companies in different ways. But eventually, it gets under control. And it becomes what\u2019s effectively, we believe, a short-term effect. And that\u2019s the way we look at it.\nRobert Spingarn: Sure. Thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Eric, I wanted to ask you to expand on a few comments you made just now with Rob. One, I guess, can you talk about your lead time on your order book? And what sort of visibility you have, just given corona? And then how do you think airlines are going to react, given the capacity has been tight in the market? Do they take this time to do maintenance work? If you could talk a little bit about that? And then you also mentioned deemphasizing low margin products and why FSG incrementals were through the roof. So, how you think about how that impacts sales growth for the year? Or is it de minimis? Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Okay. I\u2019d be happy, Sheila. So, with regard to the order patterns, I would say that in our parts business, both PMA and distribution, we receive most of the orders in the time of shipments \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in the month of shipment. So, the visibility there is probably 30 to 60 days out. Within repair, it\u2019s probably, another 30 days on top of that. And in specialty products, it\u2019s probably, say, another 60 days on top of that. So, I think that when there is an impact on the order demand, we will see it rather quickly. And so it\u2019s somewhat interesting that we haven\u2019t seen it to date. Going to your other question with regard to maintenance, yes, I think that they\u2019re taking this opportunity now to perform additional maintenance. A number of airlines have come out with that position. So we think that, that is going to happen. So perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why we haven\u2019t seen a \u2013 haven\u2019t seen an impact. With regard to the margin improvement, I think this is just the continuing ongoing focus at HEICO. As I mentioned, our team members are focused on margin. When we do business reviews, we\u2019re talking about profitability. We try to keep people focused on the single most important thing rather than 20 metrics. And of course, we go over all those metrics; we talk about them to make sure that the companies are developing in the right way. But this focus on margin is pervasive. So I\u2019m really very happy about the performance. If you noticed, we estimated 20% for the year, whereas in the quarter, I think we were 20.6%. So I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re going to maintain sort of this incredible level that we\u2019re at right now, but I do think that it\u2019s just a continuing focus and trickle up in the margin activity, while making sure that we keep our customers happy and not doing this on the backs of our customers in terms of price increases.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Okay, I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Sheila.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Thank you so much. Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Not to belabor this whole virus thing. But I was wondering if you could remind us what the company went through in the SARS period and how you saw customers respond then? And how this might be different?\nEric Mendelson: That\u2019s a very good question, Robert. This is Eric. I would say that in the SARS period, we saw more of an immediate impact, which we haven\u2019t seen to date. And perhaps the SARS pattern is giving people confidence that they need to maintain an orderly flow of business, number one. Number two, the airlines are in significantly better financial shape today than they were then. Of course, they were, at that time, coming off of the bottom. I mean just as we were really in the bottom after the 9/11 events and the economic shock that followed in 2002, SARS happened in 2003. So, the airlines were very ill-prepared to be able to, if you will, hold inventory and sort of take the long view. So thus far, I think we\u2019ve seen a lot more maturity and stability in the market. Again, we do believe there will be an impact, but we\u2019re just sort of trying to figure out where that impact is. One of the other unique things going on now, of course, is that the MAX fleet is out of service. So they perhaps don\u2019t have that, if you will, that added capacity that they\u2019ve got to think about. So, I think all of those things put together are keeping the airlines pretty confident right now. Also, I\u2019d have to say that economic activity is strong. I think confidence in the United States is strong. So I think overall, things are moving in the right direction.\nLaurans Mendelson: Robert, this one \u2013 this is Larry, I\u2019d like to add one other thing. Back in SARS time in 2003, we were highly concentrated in one \u2013 essentially one product, and that was JT8D engine. Since then, as a result of that, we have diversified both through aerospace and through ETG. So, we have a much broader footprint and the impact, individual impact, I think will be much less than it was for us than it was during the SARS problem.\nRobert Stallard: That\u2019s very helpful. And just a quick follow-up on that. If you look across me, I know you have hundreds and hundreds of different products. But if you were to look at your products and say how much of this is say, discretionary versus non-discretionary? Is it fair to say that most of this is required by the airlines to continue their operation. There\u2019s not a huge element of say, retrofit, an upgrade in here?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would definitely say that, that you\u2019re correct.\nLaurans Mendelson: We\u2019re also talking about the defense component. So as you know, our company in total defense is like 25%. I don\u2019t see any change really coming from that. And so that absorbs 25% of our revenue. And then the other parts, as Eric pointed out, I really \u2013 so far, again, in SARS, we saw it, as Eric said, very immediate. Now it\u2019s not so immediate. We haven\u2019t seen it or else we would tell you.\nRobert Stallard: Yes.\nCarlos Macau: Robert, this is Carlos. Just want to add one other final point. Eric made this point earlier, but I don\u2019t want it to get lost in the discussion. HEICO is a value proposition to our customers. We, as Eric pointed out, provide a service whereby airlines save money. Hence, if this coronavirus does actually impact the financial health of the industry, I do believe that, that puts HEICO in a unique position to serve our customers and allow them to save money on their spend to what you point out is really non-discretionary.\nRobert Stallard: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Larry, Eric, Victor, Carlos.\nCarlos Macau: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: So, Eric, I feel like we give you this question every quarter for the last year about regarding the MAX. You just mentioned the grounding persisting, and it sounds like it\u2019s going to persist a lot longer than anticipated this year. Are you seeing or can you \u2013 have you yet been able to see any kind of net benefit that you\u2019ve been able to quantify? Or any color around that?\nEric Mendelson: We \u2013 with regard to the aftermarket, there definitely has been some sort of benefit. It\u2019s very hard to be able to put a number with that. We \u2013 clearly, we\u2019ve been helped, but I\u2019ve tried to get some definition around it and really can\u2019t. However, I do have to mention that while our aftermarket has been helped with that, our specialty products business has been hurt because we do have content on new aircraft and that has definitely been impacted in the first quarter and has continued to estimate to be impacted throughout the balance of this year. So overall, for HEICO, while it\u2019s a net positive, it definitely did suppress our organic growth in the first quarter of this year.\nPeter Arment: Okay. And then if I could just follow up, Larry, on the M&A pipeline, and obviously, the HMI product line, sounds like it\u2019s a very good fit for Radiant. Just in general, have \u2013 there\u2019s been a few private equity kind of deals that didn\u2019t get done in the press regarding because of the MAX, are you seeing any change in kind of the pricing or anything regarding the deals that you\u2019re looking at?\nEric Mendelson: No, not yet. We really have not seen it. We\u2019re looking at lots of deals. We\u2019re looking \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re looking at big ones, we\u2019re looking a lot, and we\u2019re spending a lot of time doing the due dil. But we really haven\u2019t seen much change in pricing, not yet.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nPeter Lucas: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Peter Lucas for Larry.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, hi.\nPeter Lucas: Hi. You guys covered most \u2013 you guys covered most everything. Just had one quick question. Sorry, ETG was strong this quarter, driven by prior acquisitions in defense. But you mentioned space was down and expect that to level off. Just wondering if you could give us any more color on visibility for the space segment going forward.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Hi, this is Victor. We\u2019ve seen orders picking up for some of the GEO sat market. We\u2019ve seen an increase, particular in quoting activity and indications from customers that lead us to believe those will turn into orders. Those quotations will turn into order. Also the timing indications from customers as to when they would be placing orders have led us to believe that we would start to see those things materialize as the year went on. And that was the case that we\u2019re putting our budgets together last year. So that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s a back half of the year event for us. We can\u2019t be certain on that, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s looking like and indications remain the same.\nPeter Lucas: Very helpful. Thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with Canaccord.\nKen Herbert: Hi, good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Eric, I just wanted to first start with you. You \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously maintained the mid- to high single-digit organic growth outlook for the FSG segment. Comps are still very tough in the second quarter, maybe get a little easier in the back half of the year. Is there anything you\u2019d call out or point to that maybe gives you \u2013 we should watch out for as an inflection or confidence that you\u2019ll \u2013 driving the implied step-up in organic growth in the segment for the remainder of the year?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, good morning, Ken. That\u2019s a good pain. I\u2019m glad you mentioned this. I mentioned on our fourth quarter call that in the fourth quarter of 2019, Flight Support had organic growth of 12%, which followed the year prior 2018 organic growth of 13%. And I commented that 25% organic growth over a two-year period is really incredible and probably unsustainable at that point. Once the first quarter numbers came in, we realized that perhaps some of, and I think I may have mentioned this on the fourth quarter call that the fourth quarter was so strong that we wondered if a little bit of business was pulled in by our customers, not by us, from the first quarter into the fourth quarter of last year. And I think in hindsight, perhaps \u2013 I speculate that some of that has happened. So as a result, we think that perhaps the fourth quarter was a little bit larger in terms of organic growth than perhaps it otherwise would have been. And as a result, the first quarter was a little bit smaller. So, I think that gives me some, if you will, confidence and visibility into the balance of the year and why we think that organic growth is going to be at the numbers that we projected.\nKen Herbert: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So, if you normalize it, you \u2013 there\u2019s no specific one thing you\u2019d point to, but sort of a normalization as you go through the year, it sounds like.\nEric Mendelson: That instructed.\nKen Herbert: Yes. And I just wanted to follow up. Obviously, we\u2019ll get the details in the queue. But you called out maybe some weakness in specialty products. I know repair was very strong in the fourth quarter for you, partially MAX-related but other trends. Is there anything else you\u2019d call out specifically in the first quarter, up 4% organic growth? Any of the puts and takes there?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think what I was referring to in the specialty products in the first quarter of this year was not weakness, but instead while it still grew, and it did nicely, it would have grown more had it not been for the MAX grounding and the curtailment of production. So we got hurt by those activities, but we still posted good numbers there. And \u2013 but what I meant was, absent the MAX problem, we would have been even higher in that area. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s really any particular area of strength. We\u2019re really seeing good strength, very, very much broad-based across the entire Flight Support product line. So, I\u2019m really quite encouraged with everything that we\u2019re doing there. Very strong support from our customers in every area, whether it\u2019s in parts, repair, specialty products, just speaking with our team, we seem to be winning more business and increasing market penetration as a result, frankly, the way we treat our customers.\nKen Herbert: That\u2019s great. And if I could, just one final question for Carlos. Really good, obviously, cash generation in the quarter. I know, obviously, it\u2019s a high focus for the company. You kept the full year guidance intact. Is there anything you\u2019d highlight specifically, Carlos, on the first quarter or anything else operationally, maybe that you\u2019re doing a little different, which is contributing to the better cash profile as we think about things moving forward?\nCarlos Macau: I think that \u2013 I think we\u2019re not doing anything unique or special here at HEICO. The fact that we maintain high-margin businesses, and we\u2019re expanding ever so slightly those margins as we continue to grow our sales and catch efficiencies and leverage on our SG&A and then also gross margin improvement. That does drop to the bottom line and ultimately turns into cash. So that\u2019s been helpful. I \u2013 to be candid with you, if it wouldn\u2019t be for the uncertainty of the outlook for this coronavirus, we might have a different view on our outlook and our cash generation for the year. But right now, I chose to keep things relatively stagnant, if you would, with the December guidance until we get a little more visibility into how this is going to impact the airline industry.\nKen Herbert: That sounds reasonable. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I have a couple of questions. First, I was wondering, could you quantify the accrued contingent consideration benefit year-over-year, was it $1.4 million? Just looking at the cash flow.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. That\u2019s a pretty darn good guess. Yes, that\u2019s about right. We had, in Q1 of 2019, we had about 1 million \u2013 it\u2019s close to $1.4 million of contingent earn-out expense that we had to take on one of the FSG companies. And in fact, that was the last earnout payment we made on that particular subsidiary. And this year, we didn\u2019t have any of that. So ultimately, what you \u2013 wind up happening is no expense issues from last year, hence, the less expense. Your guess at 1.4% is pretty close to what it was.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And maybe, could you talk a little bit about how things are going on the CFM parts roll out? Kind of where you are in that process? And if we\u2019re actually starting to see some parts get approved and in the system, if you will?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We \u2013 as I mentioned, when the settlement came out that we said that directionally, it was good for us and that we felt that it would \u2013 it could only help that business. I would say that while we are very careful for competitive reasons, as you can imagine, not to comment on particular products, customers, regions, anything like that, I would say that I\u2019m encouraged with what I\u2019ve seen so far. And I do think that there is opportunity for us in that space.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And last one, I mean, you did mention the valuations are a little rich on the M&A pipeline, but can you characterize the pipeline for us? I mean does this look like a more promise \u2013 last year was a big year, but can you characterize as maybe a lot of midsize targets, big targets, fewer or more or what have you?\nEric Mendelson: This is Eric. I would be happy to tell you about what we\u2019re seeing over in the Flight Support side. There\u2019s a Flight Support side. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of interest in businesses that we\u2019re in, in particular, the aftermarket and the newbuild market. While we\u2019ve seen prices, I would say, at an elevated level, we are also seeing that many deals are not printing. And there are, I would say, a host of lesser quality businesses. I think that, frankly, some of the buyers out there have gotten a little bit confused. And are not \u2013 or in the past hadn\u2019t differentiated. And I think, perhaps in certain businesses have not traded that, that\u2019s a sign that either pricing is starting to come down or that people are no longer able to pass off lower quality businesses as higher quality businesses. So I would say that I\u2019m encouraged. HEICO remains the, in our opinion, the buyer of choice. We hear this from entrepreneurs all the time. And we work very hard to have a buyer-friendly, entrepreneurial culture, whereby those folks really want to be part of HEICO for the long term. And it\u2019s not, if you will, a quick private equity wring the business dry, jack-up the prices and run out the door. And for people who appreciate our model, I think we remain a great home for those businesses.\nGautam Khanna: And Victor, do you have anything to say on that?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, I think that applies across the Board, to all of HEICO equally.\nGautam Khanna: And one last one for Carlos. Just tax rate. Any update to that in the guidance update today?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. Certainly, so we still estimate for the full year, we kind of give a non-controlling interest and tax rate of somewhere between 19% and 20%. I think when we gave guidance in December, that same statement I made just now was the statement I made in December. You should assume for the remainder of the year that our tax rate will normalize. My guess is somewhere in the neighborhood, at least the way we\u2019ve modeled it out of 22.5% to 23% for the next three quarters. And that will bring us in line with that 19% to 20% overall tax and NCI rate.\nGautam Khanna: Perfect, thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto with UBS.\nLouis Raffetto: Good morning, gentlemen.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLouis Raffetto: So, I just want to follow-up on the M&A, given the sort of the current environment that we are in. The aerospace side, obviously, the OEM, there\u2019s a lot of sort of uncertainty over the next several years there, aftermarket, maybe in the near term, some uncertainty. And then if you switch over to defense, depending on what happens with the election, a lot of the Democrats are talking about cutting defense spending. So, just how are you taking that sort of environment with maybe prices that aren\u2019t really changing right now, and sort of roll that up into potential M&A?\nVictor Mendelson: Louis, this is Victor. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been used to doing and dealing with uncertainty now when our acquisition program since we started doing acquisitions in 1996, and we\u2019ve had elections every four years since then. And we\u2019ve had changes in the defense budget during those times, and we\u2019ve had changes in the commercial aviation spending, and we adjust the strategy as we go. And we look at the transactions, we look at the companies, and we buy companies that we think are appropriate for us and for both the long-term and the short-term, and it\u2019s worked out very well. So, we\u2019re very confident on our ability to continue to do that. And we\u2019re going to manage the business in the same way that we\u2019ve always done it.\nEric Mendelson: And I would also add that HEICO is a very educated buyer. When we go in and do due diligence, we understand this business extremely well. We understand their supply chains, their customers, the products that they are on, whereas I think other buyers may not be as sophisticated and knowledgeable and frankly can be fooled, and we see this all the time. HEICO is \u2013 we\u2019re in this for the long haul. We\u2019re not in it to \u2013 for get rich quick scheme or to hurry up and flip something. And when we find the right type of seller, and they\u2019re in the right type of business then we act. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under any pressure to meet a specific number of acquisitions. And I think it\u2019s proven to be true with nearly 80 acquisitions over a 23-year period.\nLaurans Mendelson: Look, if \u2013 this is Larry that we\u2019re in for the long run and not from just day to day, we believe that the commercial aerospace industry is a wonderful industry to be in. So if we buy something today, we don\u2019t expect and do the due diligence that we normally do in our understanding. We understand what\u2019s going to be around from now and for the next 10 years. So I think we\u2019re pretty sophisticated buyers. When you talk about defense, you got a similar situation. No matter who\u2019s elected, the defense budget is not going to go away. It may shrink. But when you focus, I hope you\u2019re aware of the kind of products that we make and supply to the defense industry. We don\u2019t supply tanks, bombs, guns. And we supply very high-tech electronic type of components and things like that which they need, whether we\u2019re at war or at peace just listening to every enemy that\u2019s out there on the field. So, if you really delve into the kind of defense business that we\u2019re in, you will see that we\u2019re not something that is going to be buffeted by whether the Democrats get in there or the Republicans. It may be a little stronger, a little weaker, but it\u2019s not something that we believe that affects us. You have to look at our growth pattern in the last 30 years. We\u2019ve grown at bottom line at 19%, I don\u2019t know many companies that have done that. And I think we continue to focus on being able to grow at somewhere 15% to 20%. So, I\u2019m not worried about that.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. That\u2019s very appreciated color. And just one quick one for Carlos. I noticed the other non-current assets and liabilities jumped up. Anything specific? Or just curious what that was?\nCarlos Macau: We had to implement the new accounting standard on leases. So basically \u2013 and every other company, mostly December 31, you\u2019ve probably seen that also. We had to put about $64 million worth of leases up on our books, both as liabilities and assets. It\u2019s just a gross up to the balance sheet.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. So just the lease up. All right, perfect. Thank you, Carlos.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital.\nColin Ducharme: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Most of my others have been answered already. This may be a quick easy one for both Eric and Victor. Can you remind us what, if any, or the most important macro indicators that you deem relevant \u2013 being linked to your order patterns over time? I\u2019m just asking in the context of, as we all try to assess and monitor the potential impact of outbreak of coronavirus, things that you perhaps have on your desk and are looking at? Thanks.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. This is Victor. When it comes to the coronavirus, we\u2019re, of course, watching it closely. And as you know, it is very difficult to anticipate where it\u2019s going. I mean, personally, I believe that it will spread further and it will be in this country deeper in the not-too-distant future. But that\u2019s just my opinion. We all read the press and read the same sorts of things. So the question becomes, how do you deal with it? How does it affect your business? How do you prepare for it? We\u2019ve surveyed our companies this week and asked them how they\u2019re \u2013 what they\u2019re seeing. And so far, the effect has really been immaterial or de minimis, in fact, almost across the Board. We\u2019ve had a few cases, a couple of companies where they\u2019ve said they\u2019ve had maybe one company. In fact, they\u2019ve said that\u2019s had some more material effect. But basically, it\u2019s been fairly immaterial so far. When they talk about what they\u2019re trying to do to diversify their supply chains and to stock up on extra material, things like that, what they might do with if they have people out of the plant. They have people more safe in hand, I think it\u2019s going to be that kind of flexibility, which HEICO is really good at. We\u2019re kind of known for being flexible and bobbing and weaving when we\u2019re running on an ordinary basis anyway, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to have to deal with it. And there\u2019s just no telling at this point where this thing is going to go for anybody in any industry. So flexibility is going to be the key.\nEric Mendelson: And this is Eric. I think Victor brings up a great point in flexibility and making sure that we figure out how to get the job done regardless of the market conditions, specifically with life support, clearly, in the aftermarket space, available seat miles, ASM, is the, I would say, the closest correlation. The only thing that you got to be a little bit careful on is there\u2019s been, in general, a shortage of certain maintenance capacity as the economy has been pretty strong and travel has increased. So, as some of the other analysts mentioned, airlines are taking the opportunity, if you will, in this lower period to perform some needed maintenance. So, I think that will mitigate, at least in the short term, any potential impact of the virus. But long term, ASMs are really the driver for the aftermarket. With regard to our specialty product, it is both defense spending and newbuild. However, we are on, I would say, very good programs that are very much needed in the missile defense area as well as various narrow-body newbuild programs. So, I think that we should do pretty well in that area as well. Okay. Any further questions?\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you all very much for participating and listening and for your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking to you at our second quarter conference call, which will be a little bit later this year. Thank you all and that is the extent of the conference call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Rob, this is Carlos. You're right. We don't disclose that specifically. I will tell you that consolidated because something like this doesn't just affect the Flight Support Group, it can have impacts on the ETG also. So when you think about it on a consolidated basis, our sales into Asia, in particular, the Chinese areas are in the low single digits. We're not dependent on that market. In fact, we've stated before that that's a growth opportunity for us in the future. And I just want to emphasize another thing because it may be the next question you pose on the supply chain side of things. One of the benefits that I guess, HEICO is enjoying right now is that when Trump, President Trump put his tariffs on China, a lot of our guys that were sourcing product from that region had to find alternatives. And so \u2013 or at least look for second sources. And so right now, as product is not moving out of China as quickly, we do have backup plans, and our guys are executing on that, so that it's not as dramatic of an impact to the company. Robert, this is Carlos. Just want to add one other final point. Eric made this point earlier, but I don't want it to get lost in the discussion. HEICO is a value proposition to our customers. We, as Eric pointed out, provide a service whereby airlines save money.

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 13% to $208.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from a $184.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions as well as 6% organic growth, mainly due to increased demand for our defense products, partially offset by lower sales for some of our space products, which was within our planning and expectations in the first quarter and which we expect to level up during the balance of the year. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 11% to $57.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $51.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly due to a decrease in the previously mentioned net sales of our space products, partially offset by the increased net sales of our defense products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 27.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to 28% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is mainly due to the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG& A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly due to a decrease in performance-based compensation expense as well as efficiencies realized from the net sales growth. With respect to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we now estimate approximately 6% to 7% net sales growth over the prior year, up from our prior estimate of 5% to 6%, and continue to anticipate the full year Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin to approximate 28% to 29%. Further, we continue to estimate mid-to- low single-digit organic growth in fiscal 2020. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses and the impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak, if any. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes. That definitely did. We were expecting that in our budgets and in our planning, with orders picking up as the year wears on, it was just programmatic and timing of when programs are hitting and when orders are shipping, and we're still expecting that more in the back half of the year. I would say, still back half, not first half, but back half. This is Victor. I'll just make one other comment on COVID-19, which is \u2013 I think people are expecting this to spread beyond Asia and beyond China. And nobody knows where and how that will play out. But ultimately, it gets under control. And it will, over some period of time, affect different places and different companies in different ways. But eventually, it gets under control. And it becomes what's effectively, we believe, a short-term effect. And that's the way we look at it. You're welcome. Yes. Hi, this is Victor. We've seen orders picking up for some of the GEO sat market. We've seen an increase, particular in quoting activity and indications from customers that lead us to believe those will turn into orders. Those quotations will turn into order. Also the timing indications from customers as to when they would be placing orders have led us to believe that we would start to see those things materialize as the year went on. And that was the case that we're putting our budgets together last year. So that's why we think it's a back half of the year event for us. We can't be certain on that, but that's what it's looking like and indications remain the same. You're welcome. Well, I think that applies across the Board, to all of HEICO equally. Good morning. Louis, this is Victor.

We all read the press and read the same sorts of things. So the question becomes, how do you deal with it? How does it affect your business? How do you prepare for it? We've surveyed our companies this week and asked them how they're \u2013 what they're seeing. And so far, the effect has really been immaterial or de minimis, in fact, almost across the Board. We've had a few cases, a couple of companies where they've said they've had maybe one company. In fact, they've said that's had some more material effect. But basically, it's been fairly immaterial so far. When they talk about what they're trying to do to diversify their supply chains and to stock up on extra material, things like that, what they might do with if they have people out of the plant. They have people more safe in hand, I think it's going to be that kind of flexibility, which HEICO is really good at. We're kind of known for being flexible and bobbing and weaving when we're running on an ordinary basis anyway, and that's how we're going to have to deal with it. And there's just no telling at this point where this thing is going to go for anybody in any industry. So flexibility is going to be the key."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and welcome you to HEICO's First Quarter and Fiscal 2020 Earnings Teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, I'm, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members who, again, were responsible for our strong results. I am truly proud of this dedicated loyal group, and they are the ones that continue to produce the highest quality products and services for our customers while maintaining our unique entrepreneurial culture and delivering outstanding returns to shareholders. I'd like to summarize the highlights of our first quarter results. Consolidated net income increased 54% to $121.9 million or $0.89 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $79.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were both favorably impacted by a discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was approximately $46.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively. These tax benefits were mainly driven by more stock options being exercised as they approach expiration as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the optionees' holding period. And the next comment, I think, is very critical because the tax benefit and the increase in taxes can be a little bit confusing to normal operating earnings. So I want to point out that excluding the impact of tax benefit in both periods, 2019 and 2020, net income and diluted earnings per share increased 18% and 17%, respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And I think that's an amazing accomplishment that I credit our great team members with producing those results. And to me, that should be the clearest message that we send in this entire report. Consolidated operating income increased 13% to $111 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $97.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated operating margin improved to 21.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 21% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated net sales increased 9% to $506.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $466.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In summary, our consolidated first quarter 2020 net sales increased 9%. Our operating income increased 13%. And our net income, excluding the stock option impact, increased 18%, and we are all very pleased with these results, and we hope all of our shareholders are, too. Our ETG group's net sales and operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 are up 13% and 11%, respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Those increases reflect the impact from our very well-managed and profitable fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions as well as strong double-digit organic growth for our defense products. Our Flight Support Group net sales and operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 are up 5% and 17%, respectively, over the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Those reflect organic growth within all of our product lines as well as improved gross profit margins. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 64% to a strong $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and that was up from $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We continue to forecast very strong cash flow from operations for the balance of fiscal 2020. We also continue to generate significant cash flow for our shareholders by remaining focused on developing niche products and our strategic commitment to an entrepreneurial structure that minimizes bureaucracy and focuses team members on serving our customers. Our total debt to shareholders' equity decreased to 31.4% as of January 31, 2020, down from 33.2% as of October 31, 2019. Our net debt, which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $504.8 million as of January 31, 2020 to shareholders' equity ratio decreased to 27.9% as of January 31, 2020, and that was down from 29.8% as of October 31, 2019. Our Net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.9 times as of January 31, 2020, and that was down from 0.93 times as of October 31, 2019. We are not a financially challenged company. We have major firepower behind the line to do really anything that we want to do, and we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions, and of course, our standard R&D development. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023. And we plan to utilize our financial flexibility, again, to pursue those high-quality acquisitions and maximize shareholder returns. In January 2020, we paid an increased regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which represented our 83rd consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979, and it was a 14% increase over the prior semiannual per share amount. In December 2019, our Radiant Power subsidiary acquired 100% of the business and assets of the human machine interface, or product line of Spectralux, HMI designs, manufactures, repairs, light deck, annunciators, panels, indicators and illuminated keyboards as well as lighting controls and flight deck lighting. Radiant Power is part of our ETG group, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In December 19, 2019, we acquired 80.1% of the stock of Quell Corporation, which designs and manufactures EMI, RFI and transient protection solutions who are a very wide variety of connector products in aerospace and defense. The acquisition successfully closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and has integrated well into our ETG group. And we expect that acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. In January 2020, we reported that our 3D-Plus subsidiary supplied numerous mission-critical and highly reliability components on the Solar Orbiter space mission. That mission will provide the first views of the sun's unchartered polar regions and investigate how intense radiation and energetic particles being blasted out from the sun and carried by the solar wind through the solar system will impact our home planet earth. We congratulate the European Space Agency on leading this project along with its partners at NASA, Airbus, 3D-Plus and the numerous other contributors to this effort. HEICO takes pride in 3D-Plus' involvement in this historic mission. Now at this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Moving on to diluted earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 53% to $0.89 from the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $0.58 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As previously mentioned, the increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the discrete tax benefit, net of non-controlling interest from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. Excluding, again, I repeat, excluding the impact of tax benefits in both periods, the 18% increase in diluted earnings per share reflects the strong performance within the both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies Group. Somehow or other, I think a number of analysts kind of missed that, and I want to \u2013 would like to point that out to them because some analysts didn't mention this in their report, and I think it's a very important item for shareholders to focus on. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $21.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And the increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 principally reflects the incremental impact from our fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased 13% to $17.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from $15.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Flight Support and ETG as we continue to invest approximately 3% of each sales dollar in new product development. SG&A, consolidated expenses increased and principally reflects the impact of our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 acquisitions, partially offset by lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. Carlos can explain the details to you later on if you want to know that. Consolidated SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 17.2% in the first quarter and that was down \u2013 fourth quarter of 2020, down from 18.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. That, of course, is a very positive change. And that decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales is mainly due to efficiencies, which we realized from net sales growth, the previously mentioned lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense as a percentage of net sales. Interest expense decreased to $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down from $5.5 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and that was \u2013 decrease was due mainly to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreements. Other income and expense in both years was not significant. HEICO incurred an income tax benefit of $22.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to an income tax expense of $4.1 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. We recognized the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 up $47.6 million and $16.6 million respectively. The larger benefit from stock option exercises recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was the result of more stock options being exercised as well as the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the optionees' holding period. The majority of the options exercised which generated this cash windfall for HEICO were approaching their 10-year expiration date. I have a personal comment, which I'll mention. According to the accounting rules, we do not \u2013 are not permitted to accrue those increases over the approximately 10 years that those options were vesting. Had we accrued them year by year, we wouldn't have had this big windfall all in one year. In my personal opinion, and I don't run the Accounting Board, they should make a change and permit companies to adjust those items to fair market on an annual basis, and that would eliminate a little bit of the confusion that folks seem to have with this \u2013 all of a sudden, this one windfall all at one moment. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 down from $8.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and that decrease principally reflects the impact of a dividend paid by HEICO Aerospace in June 2019 that effectively resulted in the transfer of the 20% non-controlling interest held by Lufthansa Technik in eight of our existing subsidiaries and back to the HEICO Flight Support Group. And that was partially offset by improved operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG, in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full fiscal year 2020, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate of approximately 19% to 20% of pretax income. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very, very strong, increasing 64% to $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 up from $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our working capital ratio improved to 3.4 times as of January 31, 2020, compared to 2.8 times as of October 31, 2019. Our day \u2013 DSOs or day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 46 days as of January 31, 2020. And that compared to 47 days as of January 31, 2019. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit exposure. We have very little loss in accounts receivable historically. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top five customers represented approximately 22% and 20% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, respectively. Inventory turnover rate of 132 days as of January 31 was the same as the rate for the period January 31, 2019. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we anticipate continued net sales growth within Flight Support, commercial aviation and defense product lines. We also anticipate growth within ETG, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. During fiscal 2020, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and aggressive acquisition strategy, while at the same time, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. Based upon our current economic visibility, we now estimate 14% to 15% growth in full year net income, and that was up from our prior growth estimate of 13% to 14%. And we continue to estimate approximately 6% to 8% growth in full year net sales over fiscal 2019. In addition, we continue to anticipate our fiscal 2020 consolidated operating margin to approximate 21.5% to 22%. Depreciation and amortization expense of about $89 million. CapEx approximate $42 million and cash flow from operations to approximate $475 million. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any. They also exclude any potential impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak as the impact to our business is uncertain and difficult to predict. In closing, we intend to continue to focus on intermediate and long-term growth strategies with a laser focus on growing our earnings and cash flow while executing our disciplined acquisition strategy of acquiring profitable businesses at fair prices. All of this is made possible by the dedication and hard work of our 65 \u2013 approximately 6,500 team members worldwide that continue to exceed customer expectations and deliver these outstanding results. Again, HEICO's management team thanks them for making their company a success. And I want to emphasize that their company because we consider the team members as the ones who really make it happen and they look upon HEICO as their company, and we believe that is the culture that makes our success possible. With that, those are the extent of my \u2013 our prepared remarks, and we'd like to open the floor for questions. Good morning. Robert, this one \u2013 this is Larry, I'd like to add one other thing. Back in SARS time in 2003, we were highly concentrated in one \u2013 essentially one product, and that was JT8D engine. Since then, as a result of that, we have diversified both through aerospace and through ETG. So, we have a much broader footprint and the impact, individual impact, I think will be much less than it was for us than it was during the SARS problem. We're also talking about the defense component. So as you know, our company in total defense is like 25%. I don't see any change really coming from that. And so that absorbs 25% of our revenue. And then the other parts, as Eric pointed out, I really \u2013 so far, again, in SARS, we saw it, as Eric said, very immediate. Now it's not so immediate. We haven't seen it or else we would tell you. Thank you. Good morning, Ken. Look, if \u2013 this is Larry that we're in for the long run and not from just day to day, we believe that the commercial aerospace industry is a wonderful industry to be in. So if we buy something today, we don't expect and do the due diligence that we normally do in our understanding. We understand what's going to be around from now and for the next 10 years. So I think we're pretty sophisticated buyers. When you talk about defense, you got a similar situation. No matter who's elected, the defense budget is not going to go away. It may shrink. But when you focus, I hope you're aware of the kind of products that we make and supply to the defense industry. We don't supply tanks, bombs, guns. And we supply very high-tech electronic type of components and things like that which they need, whether we're at war or at peace just listening to every enemy that's out there on the field. So, if you really delve into the kind of defense business that we're in, you will see that we're not something that is going to be buffeted by whether the Democrats get in there or the Republicans. It may be a little stronger, a little weaker, but it's not something that we believe that affects us. You have to look at our growth pattern in the last 30 years. We've grown at bottom line at 19%, I don't know many companies that have done that. And I think we continue to focus on being able to grow at somewhere 15% to 20%. So, I'm not worried about that. Thank you all very much for participating and listening and for your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking to you at our second quarter conference call, which will be a little bit later this year. Thank you all and that is the extent of the conference call."

            "name": "Eric Mendelson",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 5% to $301.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $287.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase is attributable to 4% organic growth, mainly due to increased demand and new product offerings across all of our product line. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 17% to $62 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, up from $52.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. I'd like to point out that our team members are incentivized and focused on operating income, not sales. And I consider a near 17% organic increase in operating income to be a phenomenal achievement, especially since it was accomplished while maintaining our long-term minimal price increase model and keeping the loyalty and appreciation of our customers. The increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly attributable to a more favorable product mix within all of our product lines. The previously mentioned net sales growth and a favorable impact from lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 20.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and that was up from 18.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Again, this was accomplished by maintaining our low-price increase model. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from efficiencies realized from the net sales growth as well as the previously mentioned lower expenses related to changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration. With respect to the remainder of fiscal 2020, we continue to estimate 7% to 8% net sales growth over the prior year, and now estimate the full year Flight Support Group operating margin to approximate 15%, up from the prior operating margin estimate of 19.5% to 20%. Further, we continue to estimate mid- to single \u2013 mid- to high single-digit organic growth in fiscal 2020. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses and the impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak, if any. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Yes. I would be happy to, Rob, good morning. As you know, and I think most of our shareholders know, our team members and our leadership are incentivized and focused on operating income. We try to keep things very simple. And they're not focused on revenue. They don't get compensated on revenue, they get compensated on earnings. So I think what we continue to see is a shift where we deemphasize lower-margin products, and we focus more on higher-margin products. And I think that really is the driver of the improvement in the operating income that we've seen. And I'm particularly happy, as I mentioned in my comments, that we were able to drive this increase in margin without alienating our customers. We continue to maintain a very low price increase model. So we make sure that our customers appreciate us. And that they want to come back and want \u2013 we're the vendor of choice and they want to develop more items with us. So I'm very happy that we were able to accomplish that by focusing on these new products and increasing the margin. The margin increase wasn't in any one particular area. I would say that it was very broad-based and consistent with basically how we operate the company. No, actually, so far, and I've gotten reports as late as this morning, we have not seen any material change in our orders or delivery. We are watching a few customers, and I don't want to mention which customer names, but a few customers that have been reported in the press as having some financial challenges. So we just want to make sure that we do the intelligent thing. We'll make sure that we take care of them and continue to support them. But in a sense, I think the timing for HEICO is fairly good because, as you know, February 1 was the start of our second quarter, so we're now going to be able to have another two months before we report to be able to see what the impact is. But we're watching this very closely. There has not been a change to date. I mean, clearly, in my opinion, this will impact the industry. There's no question that this will impact demand. But it is so difficult to estimate at this point, especially given the strong order pattern that we've seen to date that we just think that it would be irresponsible for us to, if you will, take a flag at what it could be. It really depends on what happens with the virus and what continues to happen with air travel. But meanwhile, our people are very much focused on their supply chains as well as their customers. And we're, of course, keeping our ear to the ground on that. By the way, Rob. This is Eric. Just to finish up on one thing, just to add on what Carlos was saying. I met with our heads of sales last week to do an in-depth review on any potential impact as a result of the coronavirus. And I can tell you, while I don't want to go into information on specific regions, countries, airlines or products, I can tell you that there is a significant increase in our cost-saving solutions at a number of customers. And our sales VPs have speculated that a part of this may be due to the coronavirus, and that they are getting very serious. We've seen historically whenever there is a supply-demand imbalance that our customers become a lot more focused on cost-saving opportunities. So we have definitely seen that. Again, I don't want to \u2013 due to competitive reasons, and I welcome our competitors on this call, I can't get into what regions, what customers, what type of products, but there has been a definite increase in interest. And where I would say we're hopeful that it will turn into something good for HEICO. Good morning, Sheila. Okay. I'd be happy, Sheila. So, with regard to the order patterns, I would say that in our parts business, both PMA and distribution, we receive most of the orders in the time of shipments \u2013 I'm sorry, in the month of shipment. So, the visibility there is probably 30 to 60 days out. Within repair, it's probably, another 30 days on top of that. And in specialty products, it's probably, say, another 60 days on top of that. So, I think that when there is an impact on the order demand, we will see it rather quickly. And so it's somewhat interesting that we haven't seen it to date. Going to your other question with regard to maintenance, yes, I think that they're taking this opportunity now to perform additional maintenance. A number of airlines have come out with that position. So we think that, that is going to happen. So perhaps that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen a \u2013 haven't seen an impact. With regard to the margin improvement, I think this is just the continuing ongoing focus at HEICO. As I mentioned, our team members are focused on margin. When we do business reviews, we're talking about profitability. We try to keep people focused on the single most important thing rather than 20 metrics. And of course, we go over all those metrics; we talk about them to make sure that the companies are developing in the right way. But this focus on margin is pervasive. So I'm really very happy about the performance. If you noticed, we estimated 20% for the year, whereas in the quarter, I think we were 20.6%. So I'm not saying that we're going to maintain sort of this incredible level that we're at right now, but I do think that it's just a continuing focus and trickle up in the margin activity, while making sure that we keep our customers happy and not doing this on the backs of our customers in terms of price increases. Thank you, Sheila. Good morning. That's a very good question, Robert. This is Eric. I would say that in the SARS period, we saw more of an immediate impact, which we haven't seen to date. And perhaps the SARS pattern is giving people confidence that they need to maintain an orderly flow of business, number one. Number two, the airlines are in significantly better financial shape today than they were then. Of course, they were, at that time, coming off of the bottom. I mean just as we were really in the bottom after the 9/11 events and the economic shock that followed in 2002, SARS happened in 2003. So, the airlines were very ill-prepared to be able to, if you will, hold inventory and sort of take the long view. So thus far, I think we've seen a lot more maturity and stability in the market. Again, we do believe there will be an impact, but we're just sort of trying to figure out where that impact is. One of the other unique things going on now, of course, is that the MAX fleet is out of service. So they perhaps don't have that, if you will, that added capacity that they've got to think about. So, I think all of those things put together are keeping the airlines pretty confident right now. Also, I'd have to say that economic activity is strong. I think confidence in the United States is strong. So I think overall, things are moving in the right direction. Yes. I would definitely say that, that you're correct. We \u2013 with regard to the aftermarket, there definitely has been some sort of benefit. It's very hard to be able to put a number with that. We \u2013 clearly, we've been helped, but I've tried to get some definition around it and really can't. However, I do have to mention that while our aftermarket has been helped with that, our specialty products business has been hurt because we do have content on new aircraft and that has definitely been impacted in the first quarter and has continued to estimate to be impacted throughout the balance of this year. So overall, for HEICO, while it's a net positive, it definitely did suppress our organic growth in the first quarter of this year. No, not yet. We really have not seen it. We're looking at lots of deals. We're looking \u2013 as you know, we're looking at big ones, we're looking a lot, and we're spending a lot of time doing the due dil. But we really haven't seen much change in pricing, not yet. Yes, hi. Hi, good morning, Ken. That's a good pain. I'm glad you mentioned this. I mentioned on our fourth quarter call that in the fourth quarter of 2019, Flight Support had organic growth of 12%, which followed the year prior 2018 organic growth of 13%. And I commented that 25% organic growth over a two-year period is really incredible and probably unsustainable at that point. Once the first quarter numbers came in, we realized that perhaps some of, and I think I may have mentioned this on the fourth quarter call that the fourth quarter was so strong that we wondered if a little bit of business was pulled in by our customers, not by us, from the first quarter into the fourth quarter of last year. And I think in hindsight, perhaps \u2013 I speculate that some of that has happened. So as a result, we think that perhaps the fourth quarter was a little bit larger in terms of organic growth than perhaps it otherwise would have been. And as a result, the first quarter was a little bit smaller. So, I think that gives me some, if you will, confidence and visibility into the balance of the year and why we think that organic growth is going to be at the numbers that we projected. That instructed. Yes. I think what I was referring to in the specialty products in the first quarter of this year was not weakness, but instead while it still grew, and it did nicely, it would have grown more had it not been for the MAX grounding and the curtailment of production. So we got hurt by those activities, but we still posted good numbers there. And \u2013 but what I meant was, absent the MAX problem, we would have been even higher in that area. I wouldn't say that there's really any particular area of strength. We're really seeing good strength, very, very much broad-based across the entire Flight Support product line. So, I'm really quite encouraged with everything that we're doing there. Very strong support from our customers in every area, whether it's in parts, repair, specialty products, just speaking with our team, we seem to be winning more business and increasing market penetration as a result, frankly, the way we treat our customers. Yes. We \u2013 as I mentioned, when the settlement came out that we said that directionally, it was good for us and that we felt that it would \u2013 it could only help that business. I would say that while we are very careful for competitive reasons, as you can imagine, not to comment on particular products, customers, regions, anything like that, I would say that I'm encouraged with what I've seen so far. And I do think that there is opportunity for us in that space. This is Eric. I would be happy to tell you about what we're seeing over in the Flight Support side. There's a Flight Support side. There's a tremendous amount of interest in businesses that we're in, in particular, the aftermarket and the newbuild market. While we've seen prices, I would say, at an elevated level, we are also seeing that many deals are not printing. And there are, I would say, a host of lesser quality businesses. I think that, frankly, some of the buyers out there have gotten a little bit confused. And are not \u2013 or in the past hadn't differentiated. And I think, perhaps in certain businesses have not traded that, that's a sign that either pricing is starting to come down or that people are no longer able to pass off lower quality businesses as higher quality businesses. So I would say that I'm encouraged. HEICO remains the, in our opinion, the buyer of choice. We hear this from entrepreneurs all the time. And we work very hard to have a buyer-friendly, entrepreneurial culture, whereby those folks really want to be part of HEICO for the long term. And it's not, if you will, a quick private equity wring the business dry, jack-up the prices and run out the door. And for people who appreciate our model, I think we remain a great home for those businesses. Good morning. And I would also add that HEICO is a very educated buyer. When we go in and do due diligence, we understand this business extremely well. We understand their supply chains, their customers, the products that they are on, whereas I think other buyers may not be as sophisticated and knowledgeable and frankly can be fooled, and we see this all the time. HEICO is \u2013 we're in this for the long haul. We're not in it to \u2013 for get rich quick scheme or to hurry up and flip something. And when we find the right type of seller, and they're in the right type of business then we act. We don't feel like we're under any pressure to meet a specific number of acquisitions. And I think it's proven to be true with nearly 80 acquisitions over a 23-year period. And this is Eric. I think Victor brings up a great point in flexibility and making sure that we figure out how to get the job done regardless of the market conditions, specifically with life support, clearly, in the aftermarket space, available seat miles, ASM, is the, I would say, the closest correlation. The only thing that you got to be a little bit careful on is there's been, in general, a shortage of certain maintenance capacity as the economy has been pretty strong and travel has increased. So, as some of the other analysts mentioned, airlines are taking the opportunity, if you will, in this lower period to perform some needed maintenance. So, I think that will mitigate, at least in the short term, any potential impact of the virus. But long term, ASMs are really the driver for the aftermarket. With regard to our specialty product, it is both defense spending and newbuild. However, we are on, I would say, very good programs that are very much needed in the missile defense area as well as various narrow-body newbuild programs. So, I think that we should do pretty well in that area as well. Okay. Any further questions?"

Parties listening to this call are encouraged to review all of HEICO's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. As we begin the call now, I turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Renz, and good morning to everybody on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to HEICO's fourth quarter and full year fiscal '21 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another outstanding year. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into another year of outstanding results for shareholders. I am encouraged that our success will continue into the next fiscal year and that will be driven by the confidence and respect that I have for all of HEICO's exceptional team members. Now summarizing the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal results, we are pleased to report much improved quarterly operating results within both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 improved 29% and 20%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth of 16%, and the favorable impact from our fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 126% and 34% in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. These substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from some recovery in global commercial air travel as compared with the prior year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. ETG reported quarterly increases of 7% and 4% in net sales and operating income, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. These record results principally reflect the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions as well as strong organic net sales growth for the majority of our products. Our total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 10.3% as of October 31, '21, and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, of $128.2 million, as of October 31, '21, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to a very low 5.6% and as of October 31, '21, and that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.26x as of October 31, '21, and that was down from 0.71x as of October 31, '20. During fiscal '21, we successfully completed six acquisitions, and we have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24. We plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and to maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling about $110 million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9% and to $444.1 million in fiscal '21, and that was up from $409.1 million in fiscal '20. I'd like to now discuss recent acquisition activity. In October 21, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Passive Wave, which is a designer and manufacturer of radio frequency and microwave components and integrated assemblies, specializing particularly in pin diode switches, pin attenuators, pin limiters, switching assemblies, an integrated subsystem found in defense and other complex electronic applications. Passive Wave is part of the ETG Group, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. In September 21, we acquired 80.1% of the stock of RH Labs, which designs and manufactures state-of-the-art radio frequency and microwave integrated assemblies, subassemblies and components used in a broad range of demanding defense applications, operating in harsh environments, including space. The remaining 19.9% interest continues to be owned by certain members of RH Lab's management team. RH is part of the ETG group, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following and closing. As I discussed during the third quarter earnings teleconference, in August '21, we acquired 89% of the equity interest of Ridge Holding holdco which owns all of Ridge engineering and Becton company. They performed tight tolerance machining and raising of large-sized parts in mission-critical defense and aerospace applications. Becton provides machining, fabricating and welding services for aerospace, defense and other industrial applications. The remaining 11% interest continued to be owned by certain members of Ridge's and Becton's management teams. These companies are part of Flight Support Group and we expect the acquisitions of these companies to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. Later on, we will comment on the pipeline for acquisitions, which, at this moment, I can tell you, is very strong, and we're optimistic on that score and the outlook for additional acquisitions. We cannot predict with certainty when they will be closed because we are in substantial due diligence. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 34% to $260.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $193.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 is principally from organic growth of 28% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 acquisitions. The organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for our commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased to $927.1 million in fiscal year '21, up from $924.8 million in fiscal year '20. The net sales increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions, partially offset by lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from a decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 126% to $48.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and up from $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects the higher net sales, a more favorable product mix across all of our product lines and a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group recognized higher inventory obsolescence expense in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2020, following the announced retirement of certain aircraft types and engine platforms by our commercial aerospace customers due to the pandemic's financial impact. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 6% to $151.9 million in fiscal year '21, up from $143.1 million in fiscal year '20. The operating income increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects lower bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in fiscal '20. As a result of the pandemic financial impact, the previously mentioned decrease in inventory obsolescence expense and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 18.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales, improved gross profit margin and lower inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 16.4% in fiscal year '21 and up from 15.5% in fiscal year '20. The operating margin increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower bad debt expense in inventory obsolescence expense, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Right, thank you. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 7% to a record $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $236.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally resulted from organic growth of 5% as well as the impact from our fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for our other specialized electronic, medical and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by lower defense products net sales in some subsidiaries. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 10% to a record $959.2 million in fiscal '21, up from $875 million in fiscal '20. The net sales increase in fiscal '21 principally reflects our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 3%. The organic growth was mostly driven by increased demand for our other specialized electronic and medical products, partially offset by decreased commercial aerospace products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 4% to a record $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from lower net sales of defense products, partially offset by an increase in net sales of other specialized electronic commercial aerospace and medical products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 7% to a record $277.3 million in fiscal year '21, up from $258.8 million in fiscal '20. The operating income increase in full fiscal year '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from a decrease in defense and space products net sales, partially offset by the increase in other specialized electronic products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was a very strong 30.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit as well as higher performance-based compensation expense. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.9% in fiscal year '21 as compared to 29.6% in fiscal '20. The operating margin decrease in fiscal '21 full year principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Moving on to earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 38% to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up nicely from $0.45 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects previously mentioned higher operating income at both operating segments. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $2.21 in fiscal '21, and that compared to $2.29 in fiscal '20. The decrease in fiscal '21 principally reflects higher income tax expense, partially offset by previously mentioned increase in the operating income of ETG and Flight Support, and lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $24.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. That was up slightly from $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, and totaled $93 million in fiscal '21, which was up slightly from $88.6 million in fiscal '20. The increase in fourth quarter and fiscal '21 principally reflects incremental impact from our fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased to $16.7 million or 3.3% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from $16.6 million or 3.9% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. R&D expense increased to $68.9 million or 3.7% of net sales in fiscal '21, and that was up from $65.6 million or again, 3.7% of net sales in fiscal '20. As traditionally has been the case, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and the Flight Support Group. SG&A Expense was $89.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation, higher other SG&A expenses, higher selling expenses as well as the impact from our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Our consolidated SG&A expenses were $334.5 million in fiscal '21, and that compared to $305.5 million in fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense as well as the impact from our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, again, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense. The Company recognized higher bad debt expense in fiscal '20 due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed bankruptcy protection during fiscal '20, and that was a result of the pandemic's financial impact on those airlines. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Again, consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 17.9% in fiscal '21 compared to 17.1% in fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal '21, principally reflects the previously mentioned higher performance-based compensation expense partially offset by lower bad debt expenses. Interest expense decreased to $1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. That was down from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to a lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Interest expense decreased to $7.3 million in the fiscal year '21, down from $13.2 million in fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to lower weighted average interest rate as well as a lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and fiscal year '21 was not significant. Moving on to comments about income taxes. Our effective rate in fiscal '21 was 14.8% as compared to 7.9% in fiscal '20. As previously discussed in prior quarterly teleconferences, HEICO recognized a larger discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in the first quarter of fiscal '20 compared to '21. And that accounted for a majority of the increase in the effective tax rate. Furthermore, our effective tax rate in fiscal '21 reflects the favorable impact of higher tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation leadership compensation plan. Our effective tax rate was 18.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, down from 22.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, and the decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax-exempt unrealized gain and capture under values of life insurance policies, again, related to the HEICO Corporation leadership compensation plan. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, principally reflects an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interests are held. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $25.5 million in fiscal '21. That compared to $21.9 million in fiscal '20. That increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in fiscal '21, principally reflects higher allocations of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions as well as an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG, in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full fiscal year '22, we anticipate a combined tax and non-controlling interest rate as a percentage of net income to be approximately 25% to 27%. Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flow. As we previously mentioned, cash flow provided by operating activities remain strong, at $110 million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as well as '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9% to $444.1 million in fiscal '21, and that was up from $409.1 million in fiscal '20. Our working capital ratio, current assets divided by current liabilities, was 3.2% in October 31, '21 compared to 4.8% as of October 31, '20. DSOs of receivables improved to 44 days as of October 31, '21 compared to 45 days October 31, '20. We continue to closely monitor receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales, and our five customers represented approximately 22% and 24% of consolidated net sales in fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Inventory turnover rate was 153 days for the year ended October 31, '21 as well as October 31, '20. The outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal '22, we expect the commercial air travel recovery to continue, particularly in certain domestic travel markets. Well perhaps slightly less so in international markets, even though the pandemic will likely continue to adversely tech commercial aerospace industry as well as HEICO. International markets have not recovered to the extent of domestic markets. And while we are very confident of their future recovery and the potential sales increase, timing at this moment is uncertain. We said basically the same thing last year, and we were proven correct, and we're predicting the same thing this year. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, including boosters, will continue to positively influence commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. As we have all continued to see and learn, it's difficult to predict the pandemic's path in effect, including new factors such as new variants, vaccination rates, which can all impact our key markets. Also government activities, government shutdowns, travel restrictions and everything under the sun, therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. But our ongoing conservative policies, extremely strong balance sheet high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new research and development, and execute on our successful acquisition program and position HEICO for market share gains. I would like to end my remarks by again thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team continues to be focused on your safety and your professional success. Collectively, we believe we've had great success in '21 and we look forward to all the opportunities ahead in fiscal '22. That's the extent of our prepared remarks, and I'd like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic. Your line is now open.\nPeter Skibitski: Guys, I wanted to ask about supply chain issues. You seem to be avoiding some of the worst case issues that some of your peers are having with regard to things like sourcing semiconductors and even sourcing labor. Are you guys seeing any issues like that at all? Or if so, how have you been able to kind of mitigate the impact?\nEric Mendelson: Pete, it's Eric speaking. Thanks for your question. With regard to that, we've been able to handle it. I think that HEICO's model of decentralized approach to business where we've got entrepreneurial people running these businesses, running all the functions within the businesses, it's their responsibility to figure out how to get it done. And you can see from the fourth quarter numbers, they've done that. Now, obviously, it's becoming a bigger challenge. We all read about that in the newspaper. And there definitely will be bumps in the road. We've seen prices go up. We've seen shortages in various areas, but we're just dealing with. And frankly, the numbers would have been the sales and the earnings would have been even better had we not had some of this. But I think overall, we are optimistic that we're going to be able to manage it. But -- and then Victor can update on the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Overall, the situation, as you know, and we've talked about in prior calls, it's been manageable with very limited shipping delays for us out to our customers. And so, I'm very proud of how our customers were prepared for this and have responded to it. And some subsidiaries are seeing minimal to no impact while it's more pronounced than others. So it really varies across the business. Companies generally -- within HEICO, generally entered the shortage with sufficient stock, and we're ordering ahead, which is really, as Eric pointed out, a benefit of our decentralized model, where our subsidiaries decide what to do is as you've heard say on this call before on these calls, we're not a big believer in just-in-time inventory management, we let our companies decide what they need to have and to project, and that's worked out very well. I would expect maybe it becomes a little more pronounced as we get into '22. But we found that we have a lot of ways to deal with it. Some of our companies have been able to design around with replacement components as well. And the lead times vary by subsidiaries. But overall, we've been able to manage those pretty well. I'll just make a comment, too, because the natural follow-on to that is, well, are you seeing price increases on your components and on your material. And the answer to that, of course, is yes. We're like everybody else, you read in the newspapers, where I think we've managed those pretty well. Sometimes those price increases are fairly low. Sometimes they're much more, again, depending on the product and the subsidiary. But generally speaking, our customers understand that. They're seeing this across their supply chains, and they're doing it with it in their own pricing. So, they've accepted where we've adjusted prices, and I expect that we'll have to continue to do that. And that, of course, will continue over the year ahead. Of course, as an aside, it is very important for us to keep offering this great value proposition that we offer. And so what we're not doing is taking advantage of our customers for it. We're making sure that we continue to offer an excellent value, but we do expect to be compensated for our cost increases as well as to sustain our margins on those increases.\nEric Mendelson: And also, Pete, just to close, this is Eric again. We have a number of our team members on the call, and I want to call them out specifically for their outstanding effort and results and dedication in making this happen. HEICO, while we're not afraid to invest in inventory. We've got very acceptable inventory turns. And I think unlike our many other peers and competitors in the industry, HEICO did not take a big onetime inventory reserve in 2020, special inventory reserve like so many other companies did. And we are able to support our customers by having proper and, I would say, lean inventories because we buy the right stuff. And I think that is very, very rare in industry today. Our people work extraordinarily hard to make sure they buy the right stuff. And if you look across the industry, there are plenty of companies who take this big onetime charges and they blame it on all sorts of one February, 10-year event like a financial crisis or COVID or 911 or all sorts of things that happen. And if you look back at HEICO's history over the last 32 years, never have we taken such a charge. We have -- yes, we do have inventory obsolescence, and we handle that within our normal results. So again, really, I get very emotional and passionate about this because our people really do a phenomenal job by focusing on the details, making sure we've got the right parts on the shelf, and we don't take these big onetime charges, whereas it seems to be standard in the industry outside of FICO.\nPeter Skibitski: Yes. That's very helpful, guys. Maybe one last quick one for me. Maybe just one more for Eric. This Omicron varies seems so recent, almost really after the quarter closed. Can you give us a sense if you've gotten any feedback from your customers yet about how that could impact kind of near-term demand? Is it having any impact at all? Or it's really kind of a black box right now, I think. So I would love to get your feedback.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I did. It's a great question. I'm sure people -- it's a burning question people want to know what's going on with that. I did my quarterly reviews with our sales heads last week. And as of last week, we did not see an impact. However, I don't think you have to really be a genius to figure out that this is going to impact the industry in some way. I think it's reasonable to assume that it will, and we are prepared for it. But I think things -- we're still very, very optimistic. There's a lot of growth potential because not all of our markets have recovered. So we still have a very big potential in the international markets, in particular, in Asia, and to a lesser extent, in Europe and South America to see recovery. So I think that we've got plenty of, if you will, green shoots ahead of us. But there's no question that the Omicron will hold back the industry. We'll have to see really what happens over the coming days and weeks due to the severity and trendiness of the variant. But again, we think that with HEICO's structure of strong capital structure as well as really focusing on the customer, focusing on the details that we're going to be fine, and we're just going to get right through this. And this is really just going to be business as usual. I mean there's no reason to think that this virus is going to disappear anytime soon, and we just got to be ready. And HEICO is resilient, and we'll handle it. And our people are very resilient. So it's not going to hold us back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.\nPeter Arment: Larry, Victor Carlos and happy holidays everyone. Carlos, I guess maybe I wanted to start with you, really just if we could talk a little bit just about incremental margins. I know -- but if you look at FSG, I think we finished the year in the kind of the mid-40s percentage-wise, ETG in the low 20s. Do you expect -- how should we think about kind of what a good normalization rate is for both segments? Do they both trend back to the low 30s? Or any puts and takes we should be thinking about?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, I think that as far as '21 was, I was pleasantly surprised with how the segments performed. As we've talked about in the past, the FSG is on a glide path. We're not expecting huge incremental bumps in their OI percentage of revenues. We're expecting more of a glide path back up to pre-pandemic levels. Pre-pandemic levels, we expected the FSG's operating margin to approach 20%. And I think that that's our target. That's what we're heading back to. And then from that point forward, we ought to see what history has told us that the segment has growth leverage, if you would, on their cost base and you eke out little improvements in the margin as you go along and power more sales. So in my opinion, I think that's the direction we're heading with the FSG. ETG is a very mix sensitive segment, and the margin can bounce around. This year, we posted 30% margins, and I'm tickled to best with our fourth quarter performance. But we could easily have posted less or more. It is that mix sensitive, and it's very acquisition-sensitive. So on an annual basis, it's really hard to predict with great degree of certainty where that margin could be. I would tell you that if it's been 27% to 30% for a long time, I expect it to stay within that it could vacillate and it could be due to things such as acquisitions. For example, if we bought a company with a 22% operating margin. I assume as an investor, you'd be very happy with us, but that would be dilutive to the overall segment margin. As long as we're still on a ton of cash, we would be indifferent to that, but we get questions about the margin, right? So that's how we're approaching it. And by the way, the alternatives could happen. We could buy over 40% margin, and it can pull it up. So that is what I believe the future holds for the ETG. We principally look at it as a cash return segment. The EBITA margin of EBITDA margin in that segment is fantastic. It's in the low 30s, and I believe that will continue. Does that help?\nPeter Arment: That's helpful. Yes, very helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Eric. Maybe you could just talk about maybe any of your, what you're seeing out of your larger customers, I know that FSG, I think the top kind of handful of customers represent at least 1/4 or 1/3 of your sales. So, maybe what you're seeing there and the opportunities for you guys to continue to grow share?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, a great question, and so I met with our folks last week. And we're doing extraordinarily well with our top customers. Actually, as a matter of fact, I think we're doing extremely well with all of our customers. They've seen through the pandemic to be more committed than ever to HEICO. I think we've supported them extraordinarily well. We maintained our new product development. We maintained our workforce. We maintained our standard development rates. So, we're satisfying them with all sorts of new and product adjacency products. So they're extremely supportive of us. So I feel very good. And I think that we are growing market share with them and with everybody. I don't know if that's sort of the color that you were looking for. I don't know anything else you'd like to know, please let me know.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Solow: Just a couple of sort of follow-ups. Obviously, the macro still some cross wins there, but it does look like passenger traffic, as you mentioned, continues to recover on a fairly consistent basis. Just trying to gauge the pace of recovery within HEICO, obviously, it seems like you guys are certainly a little bit ahead of that. You're still behind 2019 levels, pre-pandemic, but your recovery seems to be a little bit ahead of the general market. So just trying to gauge what you're seeing from customers and your market share gains and your expectations going forward, particularly on the PMA side.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. A great question, Larry. We do continue to see market share gains. I can tell you are extremely bullish. In 32 years of doing this, I've never seen a group more pumped up about the future than the folks I met with last week. We went over things in great detail, and they are extraordinarily bullish. They're also bullish because there's plenty of opportunity out there. There are areas that haven't recovered yet. And we're optimistic that we're going to see recovery in some of those areas in 2022. And our customers are really encouraging us to produce more and to do more and develop more. So I would say, the future outlook is very, very good. I mean, when you go through a crisis like this, there is no logical reason why people shouldn't buy more from us. I mean we're -- we have the best customer service and we've got the most competitive prices. And it's from a company with an $18 billion market cap. So you're not dealing with a little startup. You're dealing with somebody who can go ahead and invest and put the right inventory on the shelf and pay people and develop products stand behind that product. So I think, frankly, the wind is too HEICO is back right now. And I would anticipate that that's going to continue. I'm very bullish about that, very bullish for the future. That's specifically with the aftermarket with the -- with our businesses that are more exposed to the OEM build cycle. We have not seen as much recovery in those areas. And frankly, that provides also a great optimism and potential for the future because those markets have not recovered. If you look narrow-body market is an expected on the new-build side to recover until pick year 2024, say, and on the wide-body until maybe 2028. And of course, the wide-body peak, the new-build production, I think, peaked back in 2015 areas. So, I think we've got plenty of upside in those markets as well. Our people have worked extraordinarily hard across all of our businesses. And the ones that are more OEM exposed have not seen the success that the ones that have been more aftermarket exposed have seen. So I know that they're working extremely hard. They're pumped up. They see it's coming down the road, but we got to hang in there. And of course, with HEICO at our strong levels and strong levels of sales and customer relationships and customer service and basically no debt, I think we're in a very good position to take advantage of all this.\nLawrence Solow: Right. How about just, Eric, while you got the mic there? Just on the sort of -- I know you're not giving guidance. But near term, I know usually sort of your Q1, you get the seasonal slowdown as it's the peak season, obviously, most points are getting out in the air and getting only the real need man. Do we see that slow down? Do you expect that this quarter? Or is it seasonality a little bit skewed because of the overall ramp in spending and whatnot?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, that's a good question. And it's -- I'm not trying to not answer it, but the truth is I really don't know. I mean my sense is it's going to be fine. But yes, you'll see that traditional seasonality. And of course, the Omicron isn't going to help things. So my guess is that you would see it. But that truly is a guess and not based on sales through 45 days into the quarter, but instead, just based on having done this for so many years, yes, I think you'll see the seasonality and it should be standard in that regard.\nLawrence Solow: Got you. And then just one quick, Victor, it sounds like just at least this quarter, maybe the last couple of quarters, defense and space sort of flattish and a lot of your growth has been coming from the medical and the other electronics and industrial piece, which I know has been really strong. Is that sort of where you think sort of we really given guidance, but from a high level '22 will kind of shape out with similar trends?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Larry, so you may recall in a couple of the last calls, I'd mentioned that our specialized electronic, high-end electronic and other markets were strong for us, and I expected that to continue. And I would expect that to continue into '22 based on the comments that we -- or the budgets round that we've received from our subsidiaries. In terms of defense, as I've also talked about in a number of the calls, we kind of expected that to flatten out, maybe turned down a little bit. And I would expect to see that trend continue at least in the near term. And I think commercial space probably it's a little early to say for sure. But I would say that, that trend is more flattening and after we've had a lot of strength there.\nOperator: The next one, we have the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKristine Liwag: I guess looking at the M&A pipeline, has Omicron affected the opportunities that you're seeing? Are you seeing more opportunities or less opportunities, as we kind of see this uncertain period for long?\nLaurans Mendelson: So the answer is, I don't think Omicron has affected this at all. We have a very strong pipeline. As a matter of fact, I would have to say it's almost too strong because we are wrapped up in doing due diligence constantly. We have a number of transactions that are in the pipeline. As you know, we can't predict if it's going to close. I mean historically, if we go by past experience, we know most of them probably will close, but we can't guarantee it. But I think the ones we are looking at are all well within HEICO's normal pricing and the fact that we would expect them to be accretive in the first year and so forth if they close. And there are plenty of opportunities out there. So I don't think we've seen any change because of this situation.\nKristine Liwag: Great. And maybe a question for Victor. Victor, on space, can you speak to any trends that you're seeing? And then also, we've seen more space companies successfully raised capital and many have leased back in the past few months. Does that increase the addressable market for you, especially now you've got this new pool of customers that could potentially pay their suppliers?\nVictor Mendelson: Kristine, it's a very good question. We think it does increase our potential market, and we are dealing with some of these companies. The key, of course, is to be able to do it profitably and to do it in a production rate that makes sense for our businesses. And that's, in space, that is always the challenge. And so at this point, I would say, in terms of your question on trends, then the trends overall, I would expect to see more of these smaller start-up businesses addressing newer parts of the market. And hopefully, that gives us some more opportunity on some of our higher end products, in particular. We're not interested really in going is down to the lower end of the market just to capture sales.\nOperator: The next one, we have the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Maybe you could go back to the share -- market share situation. And I was wondering, if there was any particular product areas or aircraft types, where you're seeing more success than others?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I would say that it really is pretty much across the board, Rob. It -- we're seeing it in all of our traditional and historic markets. I would just say that it's very broad-based. As you know, we're electing to go into specifics with regard to customers, geography, product types as we've got competitors on the call. And I'm sure you and our investors recognize and appreciate that. But it is very broad-based, I would say, it's across all of our product types and really in all geographies.\nRobert Stallard: Okay. And then on the M&A pipeline, it sounds like you're -- but I was wondering if there's any waiting on the Flight Support Group versus the Electronics? Or are they both seeing a lot of interest?\nEric Mendelson: I think they're both very strong. Both businesses are very strong. We're very busy in each area. And fortunately, HEICO has got the firepower where we can afford to deploy capital in both. So it's not mutually exclusive. It's really more opportunistic.\nOperator: The next one, we have Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes. Eric, I wanted to start with you first. I wanted to follow up on the comments and everything we're seeing regarding the faster recovery for domestic travel versus international travel. Is it fair to say that when you look at your airline customers here in the United States or North America and Europe, that their maintenance spending with you for their domestic fleet in 2022, your fiscal '22 can be back to sort of pre-COVID levels. I mean how do we think about the business recovery for you and the timing for predominantly the narrow-body versus wide-body or domestic versus international fleets?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, great question, Ken. I would say, I don't think it's likely that the domestic narrow body will be back to '19 levels in '22. If it is, I think it's more towards the end of '22. We're doing extremely well, but I want to be really careful to not get ahead of ourselves here. There are certain fleets that have been retired. So that's going to be a bit of a headwind. So maybe if it happens, it's by the end of the year. But it's certainly -- I'm at this point, not anticipating that the domestic narrow-body will be back to the levels that it was at in '19. I think 2023 is probably a more reasonable guess. And I think we've got to be conservative, I mean, with regard to Omicron and who knows what comes next. But we're assuming that this virus is going to be here for a while, and we're going to have to -- everybody's going to have to live with it. So I think that, that's probably a more prudent thing. In terms of the international, Asia is still very low. And Europe is likewise also struggling more so than the North American market. So, I do think that we've got a good upside potential in those markets.\nKen Herbert: Okay. Thanks for the detail there. As you look at -- I wanted to ask about your cargo exposure. I mean cargo has clearly been -- air cargo, very strong, obviously, through this downturn. The cargo fleet tends to be older, tends to represent roughly sort of 10% of the total fleet for the larger aircraft. How is your cargo exposure? And can you comment about if that's maybe a nice opportunity where you're seeing greater growth? Or how do we think about you relative to the cargo markets?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, another great question. We're doing very well in the cargo market. Very strong for all of the obvious reasons, we anticipate that, that is going to continue. The cargo market should continue to stay strong as a result of the questions going on out there. We've got very good relationships with those customers. We're we offer a very broad product line. So I have to say I feel really good about the cargo markets.\nVictor Mendelson: So if you have any friends that are running these cargo companies, make sure they know that they can save a lot of money with HEICO and that if you want to still get free delivery with your purchases, they should come book to HEICO for some solutions.\nKen Herbert: We'll definitely pass it on. If I could, just one final question for you, Eric, obviously, the trend line would imply that you sort of get back to 20% EBIT margins at some point in fiscal '22, just looking at the strong performance of the business. Is there any reason at some point this year, you don't hit that level? Or are there other maybe headwinds we should keep in mind as we think about sort of modeling out segment margins for you?\nCarlos Macau: Ken, it's Carlos. Let me take that one. As we're sitting here today, other than time, there's no real headwind that I see. I mean both of the -- all three of the product divisions, if you would, within Flight Support are doing quite nicely. As Eric said, the Specialty Products Group is lagging a bit for the OEM cycle. I do think that once we get back to the '19 levels, and then the key is back to the '19 levels. Once we get to that point, we ought to start approaching that 20% margin. As Eric just mentioned, we're not real sure if we're going to see that in '22. But once we do, I build very strongly that we ought to those levels. So it's a timing issue, Ken, not an impediment to getting there. It's just time.\nOperator: The next one, we have the line Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Nice results. Maybe Eric or Carlos, just to stay on Ken's line of question there on the domestic versus international, I think, Carlos, you may have mentioned or maybe it's come up that possibly, you could exit fiscal '22 here in FSG at somewhere close to that quarterly run rate. But if we think about international, where I think we're still down 30% on takeoffs and landing, Omicron is going to have an impact. Do you need that international and that wide-body activity and your customers to start spending on our wide-body fleet to get back to that quarterly run rate in '19 in FSG?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think that, that would be a reasonable expectation. I mean when we anticipate the wide-body in the international markets are going to come back and they're going to come back with a vengeance. So I think we're going to do very well. To sort of -- to be honest with you, we have not modeled bifurcated recovery and figuring out all the combinations and permutations of the recovery. We feel strongly we know that it is going to come back. It is an important market for us. And -- but I think we're going to do very well. We continue to develop product for it. So if that gives you any feeling of our confidence in it, we're still very confident in it.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, I would just add to that, that I'm feeling very good about our market share gains in the segment. I think that our sales folks have done a good job of going out and being accessible to our customers, finding new product, helping them find new products that will help them be more successful. So that's a bit of a wildcard because I can't quantify it for it, but it's something that we're seeing. And that could be additive, which could get us there, could get us there a little sooner.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. And Eric, are you hearing anything from your customers? I mean sure, as we sit here today and Omicron, but obviously, these airlines are thinking six, seven months ahead. I mean, do you think there's a scenario where they start to really prep the wide-body fleet for a heavier summer travel season in international markets? And could that be a significant tailwind maybe as soon as late 1Q and then into the second quarter where you really see a lot of that prep work being done?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think that's entirely possible. My feeling is people are going to travel next summer regardless of Omicron. And yes, I think that, that is reasonable to -- they definitely are going to prepare it in advance.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. And then I'll just try one on some of the new product development. And we're going to start seeing some of the LEAP engines, GTFs start to come in for shop visits. Do you guys have content on those platforms? Should we expect that, that could be sort of accretive business to you as those engines start coming in?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Normally, as you know, we don't develop product, we don't have significant sales of products this soon in the life cycle. So we don't like to comment on specific products, but normally to in the life cycle that would not be something material.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nGautam Khanna: Happy holidays in advanced. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have been asked. Any sense for -- so first of all, within the sub-segments at FSG, I don't know if you covered this, but kind of the relative sequential growth. So by aftermarket parts versus R&O, component repair versus specialized products, how do those differ, if at all? And what are you seeing kind of where do you have better visibility of how trends are moving into the next quarter or 2? Was R&O picking up or what can you say?\nCarlos Macau: So I guess if you're talking about the recent quarter sort of trends or where things are pointing, it's coming off a pretty weak Q4 '20, but the growth has been very strong in our parts of distribution and our repair. They have grown in tandem, one quarter one is a little more strong next quarter that flips. But the trends in those two businesses are very similar. It's very strong. They're coming back. Eric mentioned earlier that Specialty Products, which houses some defense and a lot of our OEM business within the Flight Support Group. That business is doing quite nicely. We had a nice organic growth in Q4. I'd say, for the year, it's lagged a little for the reasons that Eric gave, I think that, that business generally is tied to the new build activity and how those Tier 1s are purchasing to go into the big guys, the Boeings and Airbus and that has been softer. And to Eric's point earlier, that is the part of the FSG that I think we'll see some improvement in '22, on top of all of the continued growth and strength within the parts and repair business. Does that help, Gautam?\nGautam Khanna: Yes, it does. So just to be a finer point on it, sequentially, did component repair kind of tracked out of the aftermarket parts for the sequential?\nCarlos Macau: Yes.\nGautam Khanna: That's good to see. All right. Just switching to M&A. You mentioned the pipeline is pretty busy these days. Anything promising that might be more consequential from a size perspective? Or do you kind of anticipate that it's going to be kind of like last year or the last two years where it's been more smaller tuck-ins or are you seeing bigger opportunities?\nCarlos Macau: We look at opportunities of all sizes. And so, we are looking at a variety of sizes now and it really remains to be seen which ones. And of course, we have to be careful, frankly, at this point because who we're talking with, we don't want anything -- anybody on this call to start figuring out that kind of thing But we suffice it to say that we'll continue to look at transactions that are small ones and in the hundreds of millions, and frankly, even in the billions, although, again, our criteria remains the same for the acquisition. So we're not going to go buy something just for the sake of putting up revenue that's not accretive. As you know, to us, it's all about the cash generation, the net income.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then maybe one for Eric, just on -- over the next 12, 18 months, how many new PMA parts do you anticipate adding to the portfolio?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it would be consistent with what we've done in the past. We're typically in that 400 to 500 area per year. And so I think it's going to be consistent with that. The number -- just you know, the numbers can go up and down a little bit depending on complexity and the type of product and all that. Obviously, more complex products, could they do take longer. So there would be fewer of them, but it moves around in that area.\nOperator: The next one, we have the line of Noah Carpenter with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: It's Noah Poponak. Nice to hear from you. Where would you pin the likelihood that the cash spent on acquisitions line item on the cash flow statement in fiscal '22 is the highest number that the Company deployed in a given year in its history?\nCarlos Macau: I'm not sure I understand the question. I think what Noah was asking is, are we going to spend more on that equity?\nLaurans Mendelson: We never know we never know. So I mean, we're open to making acquisitions low, and we want to make very large acquisitions. So it all depends on the opportunities. We are an opportunistic acquirer and we'll spend in the $1 billion we'll spend in the $100 million. So -- but I -- we don't know. I really don't know the answer.\nEric Mendelson: But I can tell you, we are working very hard, and we would love nothing more than to be able to deploy more capital in 2022 than we've ever done in any single year. So -- but it's -- as Dave said, estimate on what's going to happen. We've got to do our homework. And we're very careful with HEICO's money because it belongs to the shareholders. Of course, we're -- some of large shareholders. And we want to make sure that we're spending people's money correctly. So -- but we're very much focused, and we would love for it to be the biggest year in our history.\nLaurans Mendelson: No, we are -- I think I mentioned before, we are looking at a number of transactions. And the problem is we never know until we get to the closing table, whether they're really going to close. We run into due diligence glitches, data glitches where we ask for material. And since we do a very, very thorough due diligence because again, in my mind, we're spending our money and the shareholders are our partners, and we're spending our money, which is their money, and we don't want to make mistakes. So on the surface, I would say that we've earmarked -- obviously, we have $1.5 billion revolver, unsecured revolver that we can draw on. And of course, the banks have said to us they will give us many multiples of that should we want it. So it's just very hard to tell, but we would like to do it if the deals that are presented to us fit in our wheelhouse, if they meet the standards. And you know the standards we look at are the cash payback in 7 to 10 years, and we don't want to pay 14x EBITDA with pie in the sky in the future and so forth. So that strategy has served us very well, and we're going to continue that strategy. So it's really impossible to give you the answer. I know you did want -- I'd love to know the answer myself, but we're trying to spend as much as we'll possibly be effective for the HEICO program.\nNoah Poponak: No. And I'm looking for that commentary along the spectrum of possible outcomes. So that -- everything you guys provided there is super helpful, and I appreciate it. Just one other one for me is back to this conversation around international and corporate travel since that's kind of the million-dollar question here for the industry in terms of when that kicks in. I mean it seems to be very much up to government restrictions and policies on cross-border. And I just wondered if you are hearing any light you can help shed here from your teams or your customers on how that plays out? Like what has to happen? Is it Asia going away from zero COVID? Or is it -- are there cross-border discussions that are taking place with the airlines right now? Or is it just cases? Or can you just never know? I mean just given how obviously close you guys are to the industry, I wondered if there was any incremental detail you can provide there on how that can actually play out logistically?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think the airlines are very much focused, obviously, on this matter. They want to do everything they possibly can in order to encourage travel, and encourage vaccinations and testing and all that stuff. So I think they're going to be very flexible. And as different governments come out with different requirements, they're going to -- they need to be resilient and figure out just how to handle it. So I think that the industry is maturing to a point where we're all prepared for COVID to hang around for a while, and we've just got to do the best we can to really get through this, but keep everybody traveling. So they're very resilient and creative when it comes to that.\nNoah Poponak: So, it sounds like we're still without a lot of specifics on how cross-border can evolve from here and you just have to manage the business across a range of possible outcomes.\nEric Mendelson: Exactly. You got it. Yes. Yes, all right.\nOperator: The next question, we have the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital Management.\nColin Ducharme: I got a couple for Carlos. Carlos, maybe I'll just start quickly on some of the cash flow deltas. And what I'm trying to do here is just link through the windshield demand environment to what you're hearing at the subsidiary level. And then kind of link that to kind of deltas on the cash flow statement, AR being one, inventory being two, and then your change in current liabilities being three. And can you maybe just anecdotally tell us what you're hearing from the subsidiary level on the increase in AR, I'm assuming that's just increased -- improved demand environment, specifically on the FSG side. And then, linking that to your change in current liabilities, is that deferred revenue build mapping to that same trend? And then I got a quick follow-up for you.\nCarlos Macau: All right. So well, there's a lot to unpack there. Let me start with receivables. So as you pointed out, during the fourth quarter, which receivables for us generally is a function of quarters. Sales in the FSG were up 34% over '20. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a little bit of build in receivables to deal or the growth in receivables to deal with that growth in sales, which, in my judgment is a good thing. When we look at the quality of those receivables, they're in real good shape. And nothing from the subsidiaries is bubbling up, saying there's any problems that I'm very pleased with the quality of the receivables. And I think the growth is attenuated compared to our revenue growth. Look, the inventory build with sales increasing, again, inventory to a great extent, is also a quarterly function, right? The ebbs and flows kind of in three-month increments. And with 20% growth in the overall business occurring in Q4 on the sales side, the building inventory of $10 million or whatever it was -- is not so bad year-over-year. I was actually quite pleased with that. And if you heard earlier on the call, we have encouraged our subsidiaries if they need to, to go long on inventory to deal with any potential lead time issues or shortages. So I'm actually -- the working capital management in that regard, I'm very pleased with. And I think the liabilities that you're pointing out, the current liability trend, remember, in fiscal '20, the Company did not have in the FSG, any discernible performance-based compensation. There may have been pockets of it. But for the most part, it was not much to zero. And so this here, what you have on top of what I consider the outstanding performance for the segment, you have bonuses, performance base pay plus you have commissions that may not have been around last year for sales growth. And you have a lot of that selling activity that gets jammed in accruals at year end and until you pay it out. And so a lot of the movement in that caption is performance-based comp related. Does that help you?\nColin Ducharme: Yes. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. So I guess, a little bit different than what I was kind of expecting and mapping out here. Maybe I'll just leave you with a quick follow-up, higher level here, cap structure and just conservative posture here. You guys are -- you have a lot of dry powder, arguably more than you've had in many, many years. You talk about a healthy M&A pipeline. Is that an either/or, meaning the healthy M&A pipeline and the ability to put the balance sheet to work there versus getting more aggressive with perhaps a share repurchase program, something along those lines? You're in an EBITDA growth scenario, you're going to naturally delever in the medium term. Why not put the balance sheet -- take a step towards a more aggressive posture, yet still overall, stepping back, be situated very, very conservatively. If you can just speak to cap structure and view on glide path over the medium term, you guys are just very, very underlevered at the moment today here.\nLaurans Mendelson: So the answer is, we do not work in the short term. HEICO is a long term -- medium, long-term investment. You are correct. We are underlevered and we understand that. Earlier in the call, I mentioned that there are many acquisitions that are in the pipeline. We're looking at many. We do not hope and we do not intend to stay underlevered this way. So we don't have any thoughts about share purchase, repurchase to shrink the Company. We always believe in growing the Company, and that's the strategy that we have followed for 31 years, which has resulted an extraordinary growth for the shareholders. So we're not going to change the basic policy, the discipline that we use. And we're not going to, again, shrink the Company, shrink the capitalization to please speculators and traders and everything else. We're going to grow this company for long-term shareholders and of which we're probably the largest one and all the shareholders are our partners. So we feel that it's in the best interest. The other thing is the response of the shareholder community to our shares at the multiple that it sells at apparently, I believe, and after we speak to many of these institutional shareholders, they are very pleased with that policy. So again, we're going to stick to it we're not going to shrink it. And hopefully, we're going to grow it aggressively. I hope that answers your question.\nColin Ducharme: Yes, that's very helpful. And I totally respect that posture in the history and all the value you guys have generated. But if I -- in all due respect, my press on you, Larry, we're long-term shareholders as well. And while we totally respect that history, in the view of not an either/or, but putting a balance sheet to work without kind of shrinking the Company, but thinking in the guys of per share ownership. And that's essentially what we're talking about in terms of shrinking the denominator, creating value on a per share basis over time. So that would just be quick press. And again, I say that with all due respect of all the strategy and value that you've created.\nEric Mendelson: Okay. We hear you. And look, we're always running all the scenarios, we look at everything. I can promise you, we're very, very thorough in our analysis but very optimistic on acquisitions at the moment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our next question from the line of Louis Raffetto with UBS. Your line is now open.\nLouis Raffetto: So I want to sort of come back to this M&A from two points. First, can I just confirm, it looks like for 2021, acquired sales is about $70 million. And as we looked at '22 based on what's already closed, is it going to be sort of about that, maybe a little bit less?\nCarlos Macau: You're asking what the acquired sales are for the year, Louis.\nLouis Raffetto: Yes. So I think '21 was about $70 million. And I think based on what you've already completed, now what you might or might not complete, just again, it looks like maybe it will be a little bit less than that already for '22?\nCarlos Macau: You're right on the number. And I think that if things go according to plan, we would hope to have more. Again, what we've been saying is we plan on deploying capital clinics hopefully hopefully we can do that and have larger acquired sales next year.\nLouis Raffetto: I mean, I'm just looking for what's done because our -- to Larry's point, you don't know when you'll be able to close things, but if we sort of do step to that side of the M&A side. For the deals that you haven't been able to sort of complete, what has been, at the end of the day, is it just that the due diligence comes back? Is it somebody else outbids you? Any color you can provide there?\nLaurans Mendelson: There are all kinds of reasons for this, Louis. We can't give you one single reason. Lots of different things happen things you discover and due diligence, terms, all kinds of reasons.\nVictor Mendelson: Business can change. They're going to be changed. All kinds of things have happened.\nCarlos Macau: We don't have -- I can say this. We don't have many that it's very few that we get to serious due diligence and contract negotiations that don't close. That's pretty rare for us, not unheard of. But once we usually get to a certain point, the deals tend to close.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. That's awesome Eric. And then Carlos, just one for you around cash flow. So obviously, cash flow in fiscal '21 was actually, I think, the highest it's ever been. Understanding you're not giving guidance for '22, but any reason that it wouldn't necessarily grow in '22? And then any idea around the CapEx? I know you've given -- you tend to give that in the past.\nCarlos Macau: We like to grow the Company every year, 15% to 20% in normal times. And so next to that would be growth in operating cash flow. We really don't want to have earnings and no cash flow, right? So that growth we like to see work in tandem, which is a function of good management on the working capital side, right? So, that all that net income earning falls to cash in the cash provided by operating activities. So I would expect that to continue. There's now in my judgment right now, there's no impediments to that occurring next year. What was your second question?\nLouis Raffetto: Just around CapEx next year. I know in the past, you have at least -- I mean, we -- this year was up a little bit, but.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. We just finished our CapEx budgets or longer. I think we could be somewhere around $45 million next year is kind of my guess right now. But that could even flow, but that's kind of the peg we have on the ground at the moment.\nOperator: The next one, we have the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So maybe two for Eric, if that's okay. Eric. I think we talked about ETG pricing a little bit in the beginning of the call. But I was wondering about FSG. You tend to keep a 40% to 50% discount. And just given, I'm guessing suppliers and OEMs are raising their prices. How are you thinking about price? How are you gauging that, especially I'm sure you're seeing cost headwinds and labor headwinds as well? So if you could just talk about the pricing environment.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, great question, Sheila. Yes, we are seeing cost pressures, and we are very focused to make sure we maintain our margins. So I think we're going to move along with the industry, and we're going to do what the industry does. And -- but clearly, it's our intention to pass along those increases as long as they exist. We don't want to take advantage of our customers, but we need to make sure that we get our, whatever cost increases we've had passed on. Sometimes there can be a little lag if there's a contract. However, it's fully our intention to move along with the industry.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then maybe just one on Omicron and like this last variant. You guys have been through two variants now. How do you guys think about like the peak of what our case is versus your revenues? Like do you guys see any changes in airline behavior? How does that work for you guys?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I mean we haven't thus far. There's natural variation. So in the day-to-day ordering patterns, so it's hard to see. I mean, look, our sales and bookings have been extraordinarily strong. But I think it is reasonable to assume that Omicron is going to impact us. And it really depends on the severity of the cases as well as the transmissiveness of the variant. So, we're watching it closely. We're not changing any of our business practices as a result of it. We're making sure that we've got the parts on the shelf. It's -- we assume that it will hit different regions at different times, and it will sort of spread around the world. It's nice to see that there have been a number therapeutics that have been developed to be able to assist and complement the vaccines. So I don't think anybody anticipates that this is going to be a showstopper or as dramatic as Delta, other variants were. But it's just something that we're going to have to live with. And we're just going to have to run the business accordingly. So, we're working through it. It's not really changing any of our behavior. And fortunately, since we have a very strong balance sheet. And even more importantly, a phenomenal group of people, we're going to get right through this. So it doesn't -- it's not causing us to lose any sleep whatsoever. And frankly, the more strain the airlines have, I think the better position HEICO is in to pick up share.\nOperator: Thank you. We don't have any further questions at this time. Presenters, please continue.\nLaurans Mendelson: This is Larry Mendelson again. I want to thank everybody on this call for your interest in HEICO, and we appreciate it. We are available to answer questions. You can call Victor, Eric Carlos, myself. And we look forward to the next call, which will be I guess, end of February for the first quarter of '22 -- fiscal '22. And I wish everybody a very happy and holiday -- happy and healthy holiday season, good health, stay healthy, stay away from COVID, and we will speak to you in late February. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Ken, it's Carlos. Let me take that one. As we're sitting here today, other than time, there's no real headwind that I see. I mean both of the -- all three of the product divisions, if you would, within Flight Support are doing quite nicely. As Eric said, the Specialty Products Group is lagging a bit for the OEM cycle. I do think that once we get back to the '19 levels, and then the key is back to the '19 levels. Once we get to that point, we ought to start approaching that 20% margin. As Eric just mentioned, we're not real sure if we're going to see that in '22. But once we do, I build very strongly that we ought to those levels. So it's a timing issue, Ken, not an impediment to getting there. It's just time. Yes, I would just add to that, that I'm feeling very good about our market share gains in the segment. I think that our sales folks have done a good job of going out and being accessible to our customers, finding new product, helping them find new products that will help them be more successful. So that's a bit of a wildcard because I can't quantify it for it, but it's something that we're seeing. And that could be additive, which could get us there, could get us there a little sooner. So I guess if you're talking about the recent quarter sort of trends or where things are pointing, it's coming off a pretty weak Q4 '20, but the growth has been very strong in our parts of distribution and our repair. They have grown in tandem, one quarter one is a little more strong next quarter that flips. But the trends in those two businesses are very similar. It's very strong. They're coming back. Eric mentioned earlier that Specialty Products, which houses some defense and a lot of our OEM business within the Flight Support Group. That business is doing quite nicely. We had a nice organic growth in Q4. I'd say, for the year, it's lagged a little for the reasons that Eric gave, I think that, that business generally is tied to the new build activity and how those Tier 1s are purchasing to go into the big guys, the Boeings and Airbus and that has been softer. And to Eric's point earlier, that is the part of the FSG that I think we'll see some improvement in '22, on top of all of the continued growth and strength within the parts and repair business. Does that help, Gautam? Yes. We look at opportunities of all sizes. And so, we are looking at a variety of sizes now and it really remains to be seen which ones. And of course, we have to be careful, frankly, at this point because who we're talking with, we don't want anything -- anybody on this call to start figuring out that kind of thing But we suffice it to say that we'll continue to look at transactions that are small ones and in the hundreds of millions, and frankly, even in the billions, although, again, our criteria remains the same for the acquisition. So we're not going to go buy something just for the sake of putting up revenue that's not accretive. As you know, to us, it's all about the cash generation, the net income. I'm not sure I understand the question. I think what Noah was asking is, are we going to spend more on that equity? All right. So well, there's a lot to unpack there. Let me start with receivables. So as you pointed out, during the fourth quarter, which receivables for us generally is a function of quarters. Sales in the FSG were up 34% over '20. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a little bit of build in receivables to deal or the growth in receivables to deal with that growth in sales, which, in my judgment is a good thing. When we look at the quality of those receivables, they're in real good shape. And nothing from the subsidiaries is bubbling up, saying there's any problems that I'm very pleased with the quality of the receivables. And I think the growth is attenuated compared to our revenue growth. Look, the inventory build with sales increasing, again, inventory to a great extent, is also a quarterly function, right? The ebbs and flows kind of in three-month increments. And with 20% growth in the overall business occurring in Q4 on the sales side, the building inventory of $10 million or whatever it was -- is not so bad year-over-year. I was actually quite pleased with that. And if you heard earlier on the call, we have encouraged our subsidiaries if they need to, to go long on inventory to deal with any potential lead time issues or shortages. So I'm actually -- the working capital management in that regard, I'm very pleased with. And I think the liabilities that you're pointing out, the current liability trend, remember, in fiscal '20, the Company did not have in the FSG, any discernible performance-based compensation. There may have been pockets of it. But for the most part, it was not much to zero. And so this here, what you have on top of what I consider the outstanding performance for the segment, you have bonuses, performance base pay plus you have commissions that may not have been around last year for sales growth. And you have a lot of that selling activity that gets jammed in accruals at year end and until you pay it out. And so a lot of the movement in that caption is performance-based comp related. Does that help you? You're asking what the acquired sales are for the year, Louis. You're right on the number. And I think that if things go according to plan, we would hope to have more. Again, what we've been saying is we plan on deploying capital clinics hopefully hopefully we can do that and have larger acquired sales next year. We don't have -- I can say this. We don't have many that it's very few that we get to serious due diligence and contract negotiations that don't close. That's pretty rare for us, not unheard of. But once we usually get to a certain point, the deals tend to close. We like to grow the Company every year, 15% to 20% in normal times. And so next to that would be growth in operating cash flow. We really don't want to have earnings and no cash flow, right? So that growth we like to see work in tandem, which is a function of good management on the working capital side, right? So, that all that net income earning falls to cash in the cash provided by operating activities. So I would expect that to continue. There's now in my judgment right now, there's no impediments to that occurring next year. What was your second question? Yes. We just finished our CapEx budgets or longer. I think we could be somewhere around $45 million next year is kind of my guess right now. But that could even flow, but that's kind of the peg we have on the ground at the moment."

The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 7% to a record $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $236.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally resulted from organic growth of 5% as well as the impact from our fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for our other specialized electronic, medical and commercial aerospace products, partially offset by lower defense products net sales in some subsidiaries. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 10% to a record $959.2 million in fiscal '21, up from $875 million in fiscal '20. The net sales increase in fiscal '21 principally reflects our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 3%. The organic growth was mostly driven by increased demand for our other specialized electronic and medical products, partially offset by decreased commercial aerospace products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 4% to a record $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $73.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from lower net sales of defense products, partially offset by an increase in net sales of other specialized electronic commercial aerospace and medical products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 7% to a record $277.3 million in fiscal year '21, up from $258.8 million in fiscal '20. The operating income increase in full fiscal year '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from a decrease in defense and space products net sales, partially offset by the increase in other specialized electronic products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was a very strong 30.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit as well as higher performance-based compensation expense. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.9% in fiscal year '21 as compared to 29.6% in fiscal '20. The operating margin decrease in fiscal '21 full year principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes. Overall, the situation, as you know, and we've talked about in prior calls, it's been manageable with very limited shipping delays for us out to our customers. And so, I'm very proud of how our customers were prepared for this and have responded to it. And some subsidiaries are seeing minimal to no impact while it's more pronounced than others. So it really varies across the business. Companies generally -- within HEICO, generally entered the shortage with sufficient stock, and we're ordering ahead, which is really, as Eric pointed out, a benefit of our decentralized model, where our subsidiaries decide what to do is as you've heard say on this call before on these calls, we're not a big believer in just-in-time inventory management, we let our companies decide what they need to have and to project, and that's worked out very well. I would expect maybe it becomes a little more pronounced as we get into '22. But we found that we have a lot of ways to deal with it. Some of our companies have been able to design around with replacement components as well. And the lead times vary by subsidiaries. But overall, we've been able to manage those pretty well. I'll just make a comment, too, because the natural follow-on to that is, well, are you seeing price increases on your components and on your material. And the answer to that, of course, is yes. We're like everybody else, you read in the newspapers, where I think we've managed those pretty well. Sometimes those price increases are fairly low. Sometimes they're much more, again, depending on the product and the subsidiary. But generally speaking, our customers understand that. They're seeing this across their supply chains, and they're doing it with it in their own pricing. So, they've accepted where we've adjusted prices, and I expect that we'll have to continue to do that. And that, of course, will continue over the year ahead. Of course, as an aside, it is very important for us to keep offering this great value proposition that we offer. And so what we're not doing is taking advantage of our customers for it. We're making sure that we continue to offer an excellent value, but we do expect to be compensated for our cost increases as well as to sustain our margins on those increases. Well, I think that as far as '21 was, I was pleasantly surprised with how the segments performed. As we've talked about in the past, the FSG is on a glide path. We're not expecting huge incremental bumps in their OI percentage of revenues. We're expecting more of a glide path back up to pre-pandemic levels. Pre-pandemic levels, we expected the FSG's operating margin to approach 20%. And I think that that's our target. That's what we're heading back to. And then from that point forward, we ought to see what history has told us that the segment has growth leverage, if you would, on their cost base and you eke out little improvements in the margin as you go along and power more sales. So in my opinion, I think that's the direction we're heading with the FSG. ETG is a very mix sensitive segment, and the margin can bounce around. This year, we posted 30% margins, and I'm tickled to best with our fourth quarter performance. But we could easily have posted less or more. It is that mix sensitive, and it's very acquisition-sensitive. So on an annual basis, it's really hard to predict with great degree of certainty where that margin could be. I would tell you that if it's been 27% to 30% for a long time, I expect it to stay within that it could vacillate and it could be due to things such as acquisitions. For example, if we bought a company with a 22% operating margin. I assume as an investor, you'd be very happy with us, but that would be dilutive to the overall segment margin. As long as we're still on a ton of cash, we would be indifferent to that, but we get questions about the margin, right? So that's how we're approaching it. And by the way, the alternatives could happen. We could buy over 40% margin, and it can pull it up. So that is what I believe the future holds for the ETG. We principally look at it as a cash return segment. The EBITA margin of EBITDA margin in that segment is fantastic. It's in the low 30s, and I believe that will continue. Does that help? Yes. Larry, so you may recall in a couple of the last calls, I'd mentioned that our specialized electronic, high-end electronic and other markets were strong for us, and I expected that to continue. And I would expect that to continue into '22 based on the comments that we -- or the budgets round that we've received from our subsidiaries. In terms of defense, as I've also talked about in a number of the calls, we kind of expected that to flatten out, maybe turned down a little bit. And I would expect to see that trend continue at least in the near term. And I think commercial space probably it's a little early to say for sure. But I would say that, that trend is more flattening and after we've had a lot of strength there. Kristine, it's a very good question. We think it does increase our potential market, and we are dealing with some of these companies. The key, of course, is to be able to do it profitably and to do it in a production rate that makes sense for our businesses. And that's, in space, that is always the challenge. And so at this point, I would say, in terms of your question on trends, then the trends overall, I would expect to see more of these smaller start-up businesses addressing newer parts of the market. And hopefully, that gives us some more opportunity on some of our higher end products, in particular. We're not interested really in going is down to the lower end of the market just to capture sales. So if you have any friends that are running these cargo companies, make sure they know that they can save a lot of money with HEICO and that if you want to still get free delivery with your purchases, they should come book to HEICO for some solutions. Business can change. They're going to be changed. All kinds of things have happened."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Renz, and good morning to everybody on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to HEICO's fourth quarter and full year fiscal '21 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another outstanding year. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into another year of outstanding results for shareholders. I am encouraged that our success will continue into the next fiscal year and that will be driven by the confidence and respect that I have for all of HEICO's exceptional team members. Now summarizing the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal results, we are pleased to report much improved quarterly operating results within both Flight Support and Electronic Technologies. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 improved 29% and 20%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth of 16%, and the favorable impact from our fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 126% and 34% in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. These substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from some recovery in global commercial air travel as compared with the prior year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. ETG reported quarterly increases of 7% and 4% in net sales and operating income, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. These record results principally reflect the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions as well as strong organic net sales growth for the majority of our products. Our total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 10.3% as of October 31, '21, and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents, of $128.2 million, as of October 31, '21, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to a very low 5.6% and as of October 31, '21, and that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.26x as of October 31, '21, and that was down from 0.71x as of October 31, '20. During fiscal '21, we successfully completed six acquisitions, and we have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24. We plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and to maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling about $110 million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9% and to $444.1 million in fiscal '21, and that was up from $409.1 million in fiscal '20. I'd like to now discuss recent acquisition activity. In October 21, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Passive Wave, which is a designer and manufacturer of radio frequency and microwave components and integrated assemblies, specializing particularly in pin diode switches, pin attenuators, pin limiters, switching assemblies, an integrated subsystem found in defense and other complex electronic applications. Passive Wave is part of the ETG Group, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. In September 21, we acquired 80.1% of the stock of RH Labs, which designs and manufactures state-of-the-art radio frequency and microwave integrated assemblies, subassemblies and components used in a broad range of demanding defense applications, operating in harsh environments, including space. The remaining 19.9% interest continues to be owned by certain members of RH Lab's management team. RH is part of the ETG group, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following and closing. As I discussed during the third quarter earnings teleconference, in August '21, we acquired 89% of the equity interest of Ridge Holding holdco which owns all of Ridge engineering and Becton company. They performed tight tolerance machining and raising of large-sized parts in mission-critical defense and aerospace applications. Becton provides machining, fabricating and welding services for aerospace, defense and other industrial applications. The remaining 11% interest continued to be owned by certain members of Ridge's and Becton's management teams. These companies are part of Flight Support Group and we expect the acquisitions of these companies to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. Later on, we will comment on the pipeline for acquisitions, which, at this moment, I can tell you, is very strong, and we're optimistic on that score and the outlook for additional acquisitions. We cannot predict with certainty when they will be closed because we are in substantial due diligence. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Moving on to earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 38% to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up nicely from $0.45 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects previously mentioned higher operating income at both operating segments. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $2.21 in fiscal '21, and that compared to $2.29 in fiscal '20. The decrease in fiscal '21 principally reflects higher income tax expense, partially offset by previously mentioned increase in the operating income of ETG and Flight Support, and lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $24.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. That was up slightly from $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, and totaled $93 million in fiscal '21, which was up slightly from $88.6 million in fiscal '20. The increase in fourth quarter and fiscal '21 principally reflects incremental impact from our fiscal '20 and fiscal '21 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased to $16.7 million or 3.3% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from $16.6 million or 3.9% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. R&D expense increased to $68.9 million or 3.7% of net sales in fiscal '21, and that was up from $65.6 million or again, 3.7% of net sales in fiscal '20. As traditionally has been the case, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and the Flight Support Group. SG&A Expense was $89.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $72.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation, higher other SG&A expenses, higher selling expenses as well as the impact from our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Our consolidated SG&A expenses were $334.5 million in fiscal '21, and that compared to $305.5 million in fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense as well as the impact from our fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, again, partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense. The Company recognized higher bad debt expense in fiscal '20 due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed bankruptcy protection during fiscal '20, and that was a result of the pandemic's financial impact on those airlines. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Again, consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 17.9% in fiscal '21 compared to 17.1% in fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal '21, principally reflects the previously mentioned higher performance-based compensation expense partially offset by lower bad debt expenses. Interest expense decreased to $1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. That was down from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to a lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Interest expense decreased to $7.3 million in the fiscal year '21, down from $13.2 million in fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to lower weighted average interest rate as well as a lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and fiscal year '21 was not significant. Moving on to comments about income taxes. Our effective rate in fiscal '21 was 14.8% as compared to 7.9% in fiscal '20. As previously discussed in prior quarterly teleconferences, HEICO recognized a larger discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in the first quarter of fiscal '20 compared to '21. And that accounted for a majority of the increase in the effective tax rate. Furthermore, our effective tax rate in fiscal '21 reflects the favorable impact of higher tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation leadership compensation plan. Our effective tax rate was 18.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, down from 22.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, and the decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax-exempt unrealized gain and capture under values of life insurance policies, again, related to the HEICO Corporation leadership compensation plan. Income attributable to non-controlling interest was $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, principally reflects an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group in which non-controlling interests are held. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $25.5 million in fiscal '21. That compared to $21.9 million in fiscal '20. That increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in fiscal '21, principally reflects higher allocations of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions as well as an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG, in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full fiscal year '22, we anticipate a combined tax and non-controlling interest rate as a percentage of net income to be approximately 25% to 27%. Moving on to our balance sheet and cash flow. As we previously mentioned, cash flow provided by operating activities remain strong, at $110 million in both the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 as well as '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9% to $444.1 million in fiscal '21, and that was up from $409.1 million in fiscal '20. Our working capital ratio, current assets divided by current liabilities, was 3.2% in October 31, '21 compared to 4.8% as of October 31, '20. DSOs of receivables improved to 44 days as of October 31, '21 compared to 45 days October 31, '20. We continue to closely monitor receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales, and our five customers represented approximately 22% and 24% of consolidated net sales in fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Inventory turnover rate was 153 days for the year ended October 31, '21 as well as October 31, '20. The outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal '22, we expect the commercial air travel recovery to continue, particularly in certain domestic travel markets. Well perhaps slightly less so in international markets, even though the pandemic will likely continue to adversely tech commercial aerospace industry as well as HEICO. International markets have not recovered to the extent of domestic markets. And while we are very confident of their future recovery and the potential sales increase, timing at this moment is uncertain. We said basically the same thing last year, and we were proven correct, and we're predicting the same thing this year. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, including boosters, will continue to positively influence commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. As we have all continued to see and learn, it's difficult to predict the pandemic's path in effect, including new factors such as new variants, vaccination rates, which can all impact our key markets. Also government activities, government shutdowns, travel restrictions and everything under the sun, therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. But our ongoing conservative policies, extremely strong balance sheet high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new research and development, and execute on our successful acquisition program and position HEICO for market share gains. I would like to end my remarks by again thanking our team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. Our executive team continues to be focused on your safety and your professional success. Collectively, we believe we've had great success in '21 and we look forward to all the opportunities ahead in fiscal '22. That's the extent of our prepared remarks, and I'd like to open the floor for questions. So the answer is, I don't think Omicron has affected this at all. We have a very strong pipeline. As a matter of fact, I would have to say it's almost too strong because we are wrapped up in doing due diligence constantly. We have a number of transactions that are in the pipeline. As you know, we can't predict if it's going to close. I mean historically, if we go by past experience, we know most of them probably will close, but we can't guarantee it. But I think the ones we are looking at are all well within HEICO's normal pricing and the fact that we would expect them to be accretive in the first year and so forth if they close. And there are plenty of opportunities out there. So I don't think we've seen any change because of this situation. We never know we never know. So I mean, we're open to making acquisitions low, and we want to make very large acquisitions. So it all depends on the opportunities. We are an opportunistic acquirer and we'll spend in the $1 billion we'll spend in the $100 million. So -- but I -- we don't know. I really don't know the answer. No, we are -- I think I mentioned before, we are looking at a number of transactions. And the problem is we never know until we get to the closing table, whether they're really going to close. We run into due diligence glitches, data glitches where we ask for material. And since we do a very, very thorough due diligence because again, in my mind, we're spending our money and the shareholders are our partners, and we're spending our money, which is their money, and we don't want to make mistakes. So on the surface, I would say that we've earmarked -- obviously, we have $1.5 billion revolver, unsecured revolver that we can draw on. And of course, the banks have said to us they will give us many multiples of that should we want it. So it's just very hard to tell, but we would like to do it if the deals that are presented to us fit in our wheelhouse, if they meet the standards. And you know the standards we look at are the cash payback in 7 to 10 years, and we don't want to pay 14x EBITDA with pie in the sky in the future and so forth. So that strategy has served us very well, and we're going to continue that strategy. So it's really impossible to give you the answer. I know you did want -- I'd love to know the answer myself, but we're trying to spend as much as we'll possibly be effective for the HEICO program. So the answer is, we do not work in the short term. HEICO is a long term -- medium, long-term investment. You are correct. We are underlevered and we understand that. Earlier in the call, I mentioned that there are many acquisitions that are in the pipeline. We're looking at many. We do not hope and we do not intend to stay underlevered this way. So we don't have any thoughts about share purchase, repurchase to shrink the Company. We always believe in growing the Company, and that's the strategy that we have followed for 31 years, which has resulted an extraordinary growth for the shareholders. So we're not going to change the basic policy, the discipline that we use. And we're not going to, again, shrink the Company, shrink the capitalization to please speculators and traders and everything else. We're going to grow this company for long-term shareholders and of which we're probably the largest one and all the shareholders are our partners. So we feel that it's in the best interest. The other thing is the response of the shareholder community to our shares at the multiple that it sells at apparently, I believe, and after we speak to many of these institutional shareholders, they are very pleased with that policy. So again, we're going to stick to it we're not going to shrink it. And hopefully, we're going to grow it aggressively. I hope that answers your question. There are all kinds of reasons for this, Louis. We can't give you one single reason. Lots of different things happen things you discover and due diligence, terms, all kinds of reasons. This is Larry Mendelson again. I want to thank everybody on this call for your interest in HEICO, and we appreciate it. We are available to answer questions. You can call Victor, Eric Carlos, myself. And we look forward to the next call, which will be I guess, end of February for the first quarter of '22 -- fiscal '22. And I wish everybody a very happy and holiday -- happy and healthy holiday season, good health, stay healthy, stay away from COVID, and we will speak to you in late February. Thanks very much."

The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 34% to $260.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from $193.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 is principally from organic growth of 28% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 acquisitions. The organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for our commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased to $927.1 million in fiscal year '21, up from $924.8 million in fiscal year '20. The net sales increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 and '20 acquisitions, partially offset by lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from a decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 126% to $48.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and up from $21.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects the higher net sales, a more favorable product mix across all of our product lines and a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group recognized higher inventory obsolescence expense in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2020, following the announced retirement of certain aircraft types and engine platforms by our commercial aerospace customers due to the pandemic's financial impact. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 6% to $151.9 million in fiscal year '21, up from $143.1 million in fiscal year '20. The operating income increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects lower bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in fiscal '20. As a result of the pandemic financial impact, the previously mentioned decrease in inventory obsolescence expense and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 18.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, up from 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales, improved gross profit margin and lower inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 16.4% in fiscal year '21 and up from 15.5% in fiscal year '20. The operating margin increase in fiscal year '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower bad debt expense in inventory obsolescence expense, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Pete, it's Eric speaking. Thanks for your question. With regard to that, we've been able to handle it. I think that HEICO's model of decentralized approach to business where we've got entrepreneurial people running these businesses, running all the functions within the businesses, it's their responsibility to figure out how to get it done. And you can see from the fourth quarter numbers, they've done that. Now, obviously, it's becoming a bigger challenge. We all read about that in the newspaper. And there definitely will be bumps in the road. We've seen prices go up. We've seen shortages in various areas, but we're just dealing with. And frankly, the numbers would have been the sales and the earnings would have been even better had we not had some of this. But I think overall, we are optimistic that we're going to be able to manage it. But -- and then Victor can update on the Electronic Technologies Group. And also, Pete, just to close, this is Eric again. We have a number of our team members on the call, and I want to call them out specifically for their outstanding effort and results and dedication in making this happen. HEICO, while we're not afraid to invest in inventory. We've got very acceptable inventory turns. And I think unlike our many other peers and competitors in the industry, HEICO did not take a big onetime inventory reserve in 2020, special inventory reserve like so many other companies did. And we are able to support our customers by having proper and, I would say, lean inventories because we buy the right stuff. And I think that is very, very rare in industry today. Our people work extraordinarily hard to make sure they buy the right stuff. And if you look across the industry, there are plenty of companies who take this big onetime charges and they blame it on all sorts of one February, 10-year event like a financial crisis or COVID or 911 or all sorts of things that happen. And if you look back at HEICO's history over the last 32 years, never have we taken such a charge. We have -- yes, we do have inventory obsolescence, and we handle that within our normal results. So again, really, I get very emotional and passionate about this because our people really do a phenomenal job by focusing on the details, making sure we've got the right parts on the shelf, and we don't take these big onetime charges, whereas it seems to be standard in the industry outside of FICO. Yes. I did. It's a great question. I'm sure people -- it's a burning question people want to know what's going on with that. I did my quarterly reviews with our sales heads last week. And as of last week, we did not see an impact. However, I don't think you have to really be a genius to figure out that this is going to impact the industry in some way. I think it's reasonable to assume that it will, and we are prepared for it. But I think things -- we're still very, very optimistic. There's a lot of growth potential because not all of our markets have recovered. So we still have a very big potential in the international markets, in particular, in Asia, and to a lesser extent, in Europe and South America to see recovery. So I think that we've got plenty of, if you will, green shoots ahead of us. But there's no question that the Omicron will hold back the industry. We'll have to see really what happens over the coming days and weeks due to the severity and trendiness of the variant. But again, we think that with HEICO's structure of strong capital structure as well as really focusing on the customer, focusing on the details that we're going to be fine, and we're just going to get right through this. And this is really just going to be business as usual. I mean there's no reason to think that this virus is going to disappear anytime soon, and we just got to be ready. And HEICO is resilient, and we'll handle it. And our people are very resilient. So it's not going to hold us back. Yes, a great question, and so I met with our folks last week. And we're doing extraordinarily well with our top customers. Actually, as a matter of fact, I think we're doing extremely well with all of our customers. They've seen through the pandemic to be more committed than ever to HEICO. I think we've supported them extraordinarily well. We maintained our new product development. We maintained our workforce. We maintained our standard development rates. So, we're satisfying them with all sorts of new and product adjacency products. So they're extremely supportive of us. So I feel very good. And I think that we are growing market share with them and with everybody. I don't know if that's sort of the color that you were looking for. I don't know anything else you'd like to know, please let me know. Yes. A great question, Larry. We do continue to see market share gains. I can tell you are extremely bullish. In 32 years of doing this, I've never seen a group more pumped up about the future than the folks I met with last week. We went over things in great detail, and they are extraordinarily bullish. They're also bullish because there's plenty of opportunity out there. There are areas that haven't recovered yet. And we're optimistic that we're going to see recovery in some of those areas in 2022. And our customers are really encouraging us to produce more and to do more and develop more. So I would say, the future outlook is very, very good. I mean, when you go through a crisis like this, there is no logical reason why people shouldn't buy more from us. I mean we're -- we have the best customer service and we've got the most competitive prices. And it's from a company with an $18 billion market cap. So you're not dealing with a little startup. You're dealing with somebody who can go ahead and invest and put the right inventory on the shelf and pay people and develop products stand behind that product. So I think, frankly, the wind is too HEICO is back right now. And I would anticipate that that's going to continue. I'm very bullish about that, very bullish for the future. That's specifically with the aftermarket with the -- with our businesses that are more exposed to the OEM build cycle. We have not seen as much recovery in those areas. And frankly, that provides also a great optimism and potential for the future because those markets have not recovered. If you look narrow-body market is an expected on the new-build side to recover until pick year 2024, say, and on the wide-body until maybe 2028. And of course, the wide-body peak, the new-build production, I think, peaked back in 2015 areas. So, I think we've got plenty of upside in those markets as well. Our people have worked extraordinarily hard across all of our businesses. And the ones that are more OEM exposed have not seen the success that the ones that have been more aftermarket exposed have seen. So I know that they're working extremely hard. They're pumped up. They see it's coming down the road, but we got to hang in there. And of course, with HEICO at our strong levels and strong levels of sales and customer relationships and customer service and basically no debt, I think we're in a very good position to take advantage of all this. Yes, that's a good question. And it's -- I'm not trying to not answer it, but the truth is I really don't know. I mean my sense is it's going to be fine. But yes, you'll see that traditional seasonality. And of course, the Omicron isn't going to help things. So my guess is that you would see it. But that truly is a guess and not based on sales through 45 days into the quarter, but instead, just based on having done this for so many years, yes, I think you'll see the seasonality and it should be standard in that regard. Yes, I would say that it really is pretty much across the board, Rob. It -- we're seeing it in all of our traditional and historic markets. I would just say that it's very broad-based. As you know, we're electing to go into specifics with regard to customers, geography, product types as we've got competitors on the call. And I'm sure you and our investors recognize and appreciate that. But it is very broad-based, I would say, it's across all of our product types and really in all geographies. I think they're both very strong. Both businesses are very strong. We're very busy in each area. And fortunately, HEICO has got the firepower where we can afford to deploy capital in both. So it's not mutually exclusive. It's really more opportunistic. Yes, great question, Ken. I would say, I don't think it's likely that the domestic narrow body will be back to '19 levels in '22. If it is, I think it's more towards the end of '22. We're doing extremely well, but I want to be really careful to not get ahead of ourselves here. There are certain fleets that have been retired. So that's going to be a bit of a headwind. So maybe if it happens, it's by the end of the year. But it's certainly -- I'm at this point, not anticipating that the domestic narrow-body will be back to the levels that it was at in '19. I think 2023 is probably a more reasonable guess. And I think we've got to be conservative, I mean, with regard to Omicron and who knows what comes next. But we're assuming that this virus is going to be here for a while, and we're going to have to -- everybody's going to have to live with it. So I think that, that's probably a more prudent thing. In terms of the international, Asia is still very low. And Europe is likewise also struggling more so than the North American market. So, I do think that we've got a good upside potential in those markets. Yes, another great question. We're doing very well in the cargo market. Very strong for all of the obvious reasons, we anticipate that, that is going to continue. The cargo market should continue to stay strong as a result of the questions going on out there. We've got very good relationships with those customers. We're we offer a very broad product line. So I have to say I feel really good about the cargo markets. Yes. I think that, that would be a reasonable expectation. I mean when we anticipate the wide-body in the international markets are going to come back and they're going to come back with a vengeance. So I think we're going to do very well. To sort of -- to be honest with you, we have not modeled bifurcated recovery and figuring out all the combinations and permutations of the recovery. We feel strongly we know that it is going to come back. It is an important market for us. And -- but I think we're going to do very well. We continue to develop product for it. So if that gives you any feeling of our confidence in it, we're still very confident in it. Yes. I think that's entirely possible. My feeling is people are going to travel next summer regardless of Omicron. And yes, I think that, that is reasonable to -- they definitely are going to prepare it in advance. Yes. Normally, as you know, we don't develop product, we don't have significant sales of products this soon in the life cycle. So we don't like to comment on specific products, but normally to in the life cycle that would not be something material. Yes, it would be consistent with what we've done in the past. We're typically in that 400 to 500 area per year. And so I think it's going to be consistent with that. The number -- just you know, the numbers can go up and down a little bit depending on complexity and the type of product and all that. Obviously, more complex products, could they do take longer. So there would be fewer of them, but it moves around in that area. But I can tell you, we are working very hard, and we would love nothing more than to be able to deploy more capital in 2022 than we've ever done in any single year. So -- but it's -- as Dave said, estimate on what's going to happen. We've got to do our homework. And we're very careful with HEICO's money because it belongs to the shareholders. Of course, we're -- some of large shareholders. And we want to make sure that we're spending people's money correctly. So -- but we're very much focused, and we would love for it to be the biggest year in our history. Yes. I think the airlines are very much focused, obviously, on this matter. They want to do everything they possibly can in order to encourage travel, and encourage vaccinations and testing and all that stuff. So I think they're going to be very flexible. And as different governments come out with different requirements, they're going to -- they need to be resilient and figure out just how to handle it. So I think that the industry is maturing to a point where we're all prepared for COVID to hang around for a while, and we've just got to do the best we can to really get through this, but keep everybody traveling. So they're very resilient and creative when it comes to that. Exactly. You got it. Yes. Yes, all right. Okay. We hear you. And look, we're always running all the scenarios, we look at everything. I can promise you, we're very, very thorough in our analysis but very optimistic on acquisitions at the moment. Yes, great question, Sheila. Yes, we are seeing cost pressures, and we are very focused to make sure we maintain our margins. So I think we're going to move along with the industry, and we're going to do what the industry does. And -- but clearly, it's our intention to pass along those increases as long as they exist. We don't want to take advantage of our customers, but we need to make sure that we get our, whatever cost increases we've had passed on. Sometimes there can be a little lag if there's a contract. However, it's fully our intention to move along with the industry. Yes. I mean we haven't thus far. There's natural variation. So in the day-to-day ordering patterns, so it's hard to see. I mean, look, our sales and bookings have been extraordinarily strong. But I think it is reasonable to assume that Omicron is going to impact us. And it really depends on the severity of the cases as well as the transmissiveness of the variant. So, we're watching it closely. We're not changing any of our business practices as a result of it. We're making sure that we've got the parts on the shelf. It's -- we assume that it will hit different regions at different times, and it will sort of spread around the world. It's nice to see that there have been a number therapeutics that have been developed to be able to assist and complement the vaccines. So I don't think anybody anticipates that this is going to be a showstopper or as dramatic as Delta, other variants were. But it's just something that we're going to have to live with. And we're just going to have to run the business accordingly. So, we're working through it. It's not really changing any of our behavior. And fortunately, since we have a very strong balance sheet. And even more importantly, a phenomenal group of people, we're going to get right through this. So it doesn't -- it's not causing us to lose any sleep whatsoever. And frankly, the more strain the airlines have, I think the better position HEICO is in to pick up share."

High-cost liquidity and the amount of and timing of cash generation, lower commercial air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demands for our goods and services, product specification costs and requirements, which should cause an increase to our cost to complete contracts. Governmental and regulatory demands, export policies, and restrictions. Reduction in defense, space, or homeland security spending by U.S. and or foreign customers, or a combination from existing and new competitors. Which could reduce sales which could reduce our sales or ability to introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce our sales or sales growth product development or manufacturing difficulties, which could increase our product development and manufacturing costs and  sales.

As we begin the call. Now, I turn the call over to Lawrence Mendelson, HEICO 's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLawrence Mendelson: Thank you very much. And good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to this HEICO Third Quarter Fiscal '21 Earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning, by Eric Mendelson, HEICO 's, Co-President and President of HEICO 's Flight Support Group. Victor Mendelson, HEICO 's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group. And Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before beginning my review of the operating result, I'd like to take a moment and recognize all of HEICO 's talented team members for their extraordinarily high performance during the challenging times brought on by COVID-19. The dedication to HEICO's customers and the safety of their fellow team members continues to be exceptional in our opinion. On behalf of our Board of Directors and management, I want to thank each and every member of HEICO 's worldwide team for these efforts and the outstanding results that we are reporting today. I will now summarize the highlights of our third quarter and first 9 months of Fiscal '21. We were very pleased to report consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 improved 47% and 22% respectively as compared to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 20, which was the Quarter in which our operating results were most negatively affected by the pandemic. Our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net Sales growth of 17%, as well as the favorable impact from our Fiscal '20 and ' 21 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 250% and 33%, in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal '20. These substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from some recovery in global, commercial air travel as compared to the prior year. In addition, this marks the 4th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. We are very pleased with this trend and we do expect to see it continue. The Electronic Technologies Group reported quarterly increases of 14% and 11% in net sales and operating incomes respectively, as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal '20. These increases principally reflect the impact from our profitable Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, as well as strong organic net sales for the majority of our products. Our total debt to shareholders equity improved to 17.4% as of July 31, '21, and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of a 117.1 million as of July 31, compared to shareholders equity ratio improved to a very low 5.3% as of 07/31/21. And that was down from 16.6% as of October 3120. Obviously, we are not a heavily leveraged Company and we have a lot of debt capacity and the ability for acquisition and growth. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.25% as of 07/31/2021. Down from 0.71 times as of 10/31/2020. During Fiscal '21, we successfully completed four acquisitions and have no significant debt maturities until Fiscal '24. We plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong, increasing 33% to a 124 billion in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 93.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, increasing 12% to 334.1 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 299 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. In July '21, we paid a regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.09 per share. And this represented our 86th consecutive semi-annual cash dividend. And it was 12.5% higher than the $0.08 per share cash dividend we paid in January '21. In 06/21, we acquired 81 -- 80.1% of the assets of Camtronics and FAA certified part 145 repair station with extensive proprietary FAA designated engineering representative repairs. The remaining 19.9% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Camtronics management team, as well as certain members of the management team, of an existing HEICO Flight Support subsidiary. Camtronics is part of HEICO Flight Support, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. Earlier this month, we acquired 89% of rin -- Ridge Engineering and the Bechdon Company. Ridge is a leading -- a leader in performing tight tolerance machining and brazing of large-sized parts in mission-critical defense and aerospace applications. Bechdon provides machining, fabrication, and welding services for aerospace defense and other industrial applications. The remaining 11% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Ridge's and Bechdon management team. These companies are now part of HEICO 's Flight Support Group, and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO 's Flight Support Group. And he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. I'd like to start out by first thanking all of HEICO's team members for their incredible dedication, and in particular, their sacrifice in 2020. I think our shareholders and the community at large expect phenomenal results from HEICO. And they just automatically think that we're able to pump out these incredible results quarter-after-quarter. But the truth is that all of the businesses that we're in are very competitive businesses. And our people have to work incredibly hard. And last year, they went through tremendous sacrifices, tremendous personal sacrifices. And in order to help HEICO and looking at the results that we see now today, I believe is the result of that hard work and dedication. So I just personally thank all of the HEICO team members for everything that they've done to make our Company what it is today. Moving on to the prepared remarks, the Flight Support Group 's net sales increased 33% to 237.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from 178.2 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, is principally from organic growth of 32%. The organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's net sales were 666.7 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 731.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The net sales decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from a decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 250% to 42.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $12 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, and an improved gross profit margin, mainly due to increased demand for our commercial aviation products. Additionally, we had a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of Fiscal '20 last year, as a result of the pandemic's financial impact. The Flight Support Group's operating income was 100 -- 103.4 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 121.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The Operating income decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower net sales, as well as higher performance-based compensation expense in the impact from loss, fixed cost deficiencies stemming from the pandemic, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 17.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from 6.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating margin increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned increase in net sales, improved gross profit margin, and lower bad debt expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 15.5% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, as compared to 16.6% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The operating margin decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned higher performance-based compensation expense in lost fixed cost efficiencies partly offset by the previously mentioned lower bad debt expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Eric, thank you. And first, let me thank all of HEICO 's remarkably talented and dedicated team members who delivered yet again, on behalf of each other, on behalf of our customers and on behalf of our fellow shareholders this quarter, as you did throughout 2020 and throughout this year, and frankly before. And as you do in both good times and in challenging times, we are truly grateful for what you do and how you do it. And thank you to all of our team members. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 14% to $239.5 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $210.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally resulted from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, as well as organic growth of 5%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand from our other electronic, defense, medical, and commercial aerospace products partially offset by decreased commercial space net sales. As we've historically noted, commercial space revenue recognitions tends to be uneven through the quarters due to factors like 606 accounting and periodic shifting of production resources between commercial and defense space work, which occurred this quarter and saw a total space activity overall in line with our expectations. Importantly, our space orders remain healthy. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 11% to a record $706.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, up from $638.3 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, principally reflects our Fiscal '20 and ' 21 acquisitions, as well as organic growth of 2%. The organic growth principally reflects decreased demand for our other electronic and defense products, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace and commercial space product sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 11% to $69 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $61.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a slightly lower gross profit margin mainly from the commercial space products net sales decrease. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 8% to a record $200.4 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, up from $184.9 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly from a less favorable product mix for defense products and the lower commercial space products net sales which in turn was partially offset by an increase in net sales of other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.8% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, as compared to 29.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.4% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 29% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The current year's third quarter and 9 month margins are within the anticipated range I frequently discussed on these calls, and remain excellent overall margins of which we and our team members are very proud. The operating margin change in the third quarter in 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin effects from the periodic commercial space sales shift. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLawrence Mendelson: Thank you Victor and Eric. Moving on to earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share increased 40% to $0.56 in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up from $0.40 in the third quarter of Fiscal 20. The increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects previously mentioned higher operating income at both operating segments. Consolidated net income per diluted share was a $1.58 in the first nine months of fiscal 21, and that compared to a $1.83 in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The decrease in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher income tax expense and lower operating income of Flight Support, partially offset by higher operating income of the Electronic Technologies Group. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 22.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from 21.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20 and totaled 68.8 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 65.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in the third quarter and first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflect the incremental impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased to $18 million or 3.8% of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 15.1 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. R&D expense increased to 52.2 million or 3.8% of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 49 million or 3.6% of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. As usual, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. Our consolidated SG&A expenses with 83.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 and that compared to 75 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense, higher other SG&A expense, and the impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expenses were 245.1 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 232.8 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expenses in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense and the impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, and partially offset by reductions in bad debt expense and other SG&A expense. The Company's lower bad debt expense in the first 9 months and third quarter of Fiscal '21 reflects higher bad debt expense in the first 9 months in third quarter of Fiscal '20, and that was due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of Fiscal '20 as a result of the pandemic's financial impact. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 17.8% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was down from 19.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. Principally reflects lower bad debt expense, as well as efficiency gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was a18.1% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that compared to 17.1% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Interest expense decreased to $1.7 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was down from $2.6 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The decrease was principally due to lower weighted average balance on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. An interest expense decreased to 6.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, down from 10.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first 9 months and third quarter was not significant. Our effective tax rate was 15.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up from 13.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The increase principally reflects a larger deduction related to foreign derived intangible income, principally resulting from final tax regulations that were issued in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 was 13.3%, and that compared to 3.5% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. As previously discussed in a prior quarterly teleconference, HEICO recognized a larger discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in the first quarter of Fiscal '20 compared to Fiscal '21. And that accounted for the majority of the increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender value of life insurance policy related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation plan. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $6.8 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 3.2 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 18.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 16.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in both the third quarter, Fiscal '21, and the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, principally reflects higher allocation of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain Fiscal '20 acquisitions and an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full Fiscal '21 year, we now estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate between 22% and 23% of pre -tax income. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 41 days as of July 20 -- 31, '21. And that was down from 43 days as of July 31, '20. Of course, we monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit exposure. No 1 customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. And our top 5 customers represented approximately 22% and 25% of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate improved to 150 days for the period ending 07/31/21. And that compared to 154 days for the period ending 07/31/20. Now, for the outlook. Looking ahead to the remainder of Fiscal '21 and to Fiscal '22, we remain cautiously optimistic that the on-going worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will positively influence commercial air travel and will benefit the markets we serve. But as we have all learned, it is difficult to predict the pandemic's path and effect, including factors like vaccination rates, new variants, which can impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide Fiscal '21 net sales and earnings guidance at this time, nor for '22. However, our ongoing conservative policies, very strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity, enable us to invest in new R&D, execute on our successful acquisition program, and position HEICO for market share gains as the industry recovers. Again, in closing, I would like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Without their unwavering passion to exceed customer expectation, our outstanding quarterly results would not be possible. Thank you for making HEICO such an excellent and unique Company. I also want to thank our loyal shareholder base that recognizes that the future -- or believes, as we do, that the future is very bright, and continue to hold our shares and support our efforts. Thank you. And now I'd like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to remind everyone  We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nLarry Solow: Great. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. First question, Larry, and perhaps for you, just on a more macro temperature check. It sounds like -- obviously, we realize the very fluid situation with COVID and all. But just, what are you guys seeing? Obviously, a nice large improvement in commercial travel in the first 6 months of the year, and now we're stabilizing down about 20%.  Has this driven any changes in customer behavior order trends? And more importantly, the path to full recovery seems like it's still a bit up in the air, but do you still think you can get back to '19 levels, sometime perhaps towards the end of calendar '22? It's --- particularly in FSG and on commercial aviation?\nLawrence Mendelson: So, Larry, that's a very difficult question to ask. It's like asking a fortune-teller what's in my future?\nLarry Solow: Right.\nLawrence Mendelson: So, it's so difficult because of things like the new Delta version of COVID pop-up. All of a sudden, we were on the street. Restaurants are pulling back. The people are saying, well -- hesitating and so forth. My personal opinion is that we will continue to grow through the remainder of '20 -- I'm talking about Flight Support.\nLarry Solow: Yeah, of course.\nLawrence Mendelson: We'll grow through the remainder of '21 and certainly into '22. Again, we're cautious because what is going to happen, will the other shoe drop? Assuming that we don't have another shoe dropping and another version of COVID or some other unusual event, or the Afghanis attacking Mr. Biden or something, but yes, assuming things are kind of normal, I see continued strength and growth in our markets.  But, to go out on a limb and predict it and tell shareholders we're definitely going to do it, that's just not been our style. We don't hype the stocks. We try our best, but I have a very positive outlook. I can't -- based upon what I see, I feel very positive. But could something else happen? Yes. I'd like Eric to add to that if you don't mind.\nLarry Solow: Absolutely.\nEric Mendelson: Hi, Larry. Good morning --\nLarry Solow: Hi\nEric Mendelson: It's Eric, Great question and something we spend a lot of time talking about. I spent a lot of the last 2 weeks with our aftermarket leadership and sales and marketing folks, understanding what they're seeing and what their plans are. And I can tell you that they are all very optimistic. And I believe that we -- not I believe. We are continuing to take market share. We're doing very well in all of our businesses in the aftermarket.  I feel that since we were able to hang on to a greater percentage of our people than our competitors, that we are very well positioned for the recovery. Specifically, to answer your question, across-the-board, no. We have not seen a drop in business as a result of the Delta variant thus far. The Americas, in general, have been strong. Europe never saw really the recovery. In Asia, ex-China hasn't seen the recovery.  I think that we've got a lot of wind to our backs. And I think of a lot of increased demand to help drive the -- continue to drive the sales higher. Having said that, if you look at what's going on with the Delta variant in the United States, I think it's inevitable that there will be a little bit of a pullback here. I think people are continuing to travel for personal travel as well as for business meetings. I think where travel is being clipped, is in larger conventions.\nLarry Solow: Right.\nEric Mendelson: Larger group meetings. So, I don't -- we haven't seen it, but it would be logical for it to temper back a little bit. Of course, there's normally a little bit of a Fall pullback anyway. But again, since we haven't seen the rebound in Europe nor Asia, ex-China, I think that we've got a lot of very good potential there. So, I remain very optimistic. As far as when do we get back to the ' 19 levels? I certainly hope that by the end of '22, we are back at the '19 levels.  However, that is not to say that '22 will equal '19, because it's going to take a while to get back to those levels. I think the consensus in the industry is that 2023 should overall, for full-year, be equal to '19. And remember, our 2023 starts November 1st of 2022. I'm pretty optimistic about how we're doing. We feel good notwithstanding the recent news flow.\nLarry Solow: Right. No, I really appreciate that color. And maybe just switching gears real fast. Quick question for Victor. I know you guys don't give specifics on particular acquisitions, but it does look like the Ridge Engineering and Bechdon group, I guess that's two separate purchases is combined. Looks like it's a little bit larger than some of your smaller ones to date.  I guess that's part A of the question and Part B, it looks like there -- you don't have manufacturing expertise, so perhaps there are some cross-selling opportunities using their technologies or their expertise or capabilities as you look at other businesses as well. Is that true?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, Larry, this is Victor. Of course, that, as you know, is part of the Flight Support Group being a mechanical manufacturing business and metals-based manufacturing business. And there is some opportunity for cross-selling with some of the things that the ETG does. I don't think it's going to be a tremendous needle mover. But there is some opportunity there, and we'll explore those as we get a little further down the road and a little more time passes.\nLarry Solow: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nVictor Mendelson: You're welcome.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nLawrence Mendelson: Morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: HEICO has always been a -- thought of as a leader in the P$A Market, but curious of your thoughts on the DER market. Is Camtronics a part of any larger opportunity in DER or just -- what are some of the dynamics you're seeing in that market?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. Josh, that's a great question. I think something that a lot of people often overlook. But yes, HEICO, I'd -- we believe is the largest independent repair and overhaul group focusing on the components market in the world. And we say independent, mean, non - OEM, non-airline, non-government affiliated. And a key part of that strategy is using the DER repairs.  And when we combine that with the opportunity to use certain PMA parts, it results in an unbeatable combination. I can tell you that -- we operate a very decentralized business where we've got businesses that focus on a specific product and Camtronics is particularly good in a number of the products that it does, and it does have DERs.  I think we've got the ability to develop more DERs. And I think we're going to do very well because we offer it as a full suite. It's not just walking in and offering a single DER. It's offering lots of different DERs. So yes, I think that's been an important part of the strategy, along with the PMA.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay. And then just thinking about the bad debt expense exposure at this point. Last year, obviously was a very tough time for the airlines. But as the government support tapers off going forward, what do you think about your airline partner's financial position, just broadly speaking? Do you think that the bad debt expenses are behind us, or do you think that we should just be cognizant going forward?\nEric Mendelson: I think the stress is behind us, frankly. I feel good about where they are. And I can tell you looking at some of the older patterns and some of the stuff that they're ordering from us that they never bought from us before leads me to believe that HEICO is going to continue to take market share as they've got to focus on cost. And that HEICO has treated them very well through these crises. But I really think the airline distress is behind us.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nPeter Arment: Good morning, Larry, Victor, Carlos.\nLawrence Mendelson: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Eric, maybe just to start with you on, can you maybe just give us a little more color on what you just mentioned on order rates at FSG regarding that you were early on calling the end of the destocking. And we saw surprisingly 16% sequential growth last quarter, but just 3% this quarter. Maybe you could talk maybe a little bit about the cadence of what you're seeing.\nEric Mendelson: Sure. I mentioned in the call -- in the second quarter call 3 months ago that the 16% really surprised us and we were frankly shocked to see it so strong. And I cautioned everybody at that time that I didn't see that continuing. And sure enough, that didn't continue at that 16% rate. But look, I'm very happy that we held the ground. When you go up 16%, often you can cut back, trim back. I was happy that we were able to post 3% above what was off the chart numbers. In hindsight, would it have looked good to have 10% growth and then 10% growth? Yes, but that's not how we manage it. I can tell the airlines with whom we deal are very optimistic and I've never spoken to our sales force before and seeing them so positive and optimistic. Now, part of that is due to us gaining market share in the PMA and the DER, as well as the distribution area. So, HEICO is doing very well because we were financially strong through the crisis.  We held on to a much larger percentage of our workforce than our competitors. So, I think we're starting to reap those benefits. It's very hard to figure out quarter-over-quarter increases. Again, the other -- the focus and -- the other point I want to make is that our businesses are focused on profitability. And if you see the profitability in the margin, it far outpaced the sales increase. We evaluate businesses on cash flow and profitability. Sales are sort of irrelevant.  As a matter of fact, if you have a lot of sales and not profitability, that's not a good thing at HEICO. We don't want to tie up capital in that. We'd rather invest capital in something that's going to produce income. I'm overjoyed, frankly, with the earnings that we've been able to put out while delivering very good savings to the customers. And I think that in North America, it's -- there's got to be some impact on flight schedules, but I think it's going to be at the margins.  And again, Europe and Asia, ex-China, haven't experienced the return. So, I think we've got far more upside in those areas than we do in some little potential risk in the United States. I got to say our -- the major operators in the United States are all without exception, very optimistic. And they want to make sure that they are going to get products and everybody is nervous about supply chain shortages.  There were articles in the Journal today about China not being able to -- not that we get our parts from China, but not being able to get enough labor for their factories, as well as COVID in Vietnam and all sorts of supply chain challenges. So, I think they're going to be pretty aggressive and leave those parts unordered, so I'm -- we're feeling good.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. So just to follow up on that. So, we're not really seeing a restocking yet on the shelves yet for -- it's -- in terms of the transition from out of the end of the destocking. You're just -- you're in a more normalized rate matching overall flight activity. We haven't seen a restocking of parts yet.\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I would say that is correct. But I think in hindsight, some of the second quarter may have been a little bit of restocking for certain customers. No, there's not wholesale restocking going on. But in the Americas, the -- in North America, I think the airlines want to make sure that they've got enough parts on the shelf. Maybe there has been a little bit -- there was a little bit of that in the second quarter, but not to the full extent that we would anticipate.\nPeter Arment: Okay. Understood. And just a follow-up, a quick one, Carlos. Just the cash generation continues to be really impressive. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about expectations around the working Capital dynamic from here. Is there a potential for a little bit of a headwind as demand starts to pick up, as we go into next year, building any inventory or anything?\nCarlos Macau: Peter, thanks for the question. I was feeling lonely over there in the corner. Working Capital management on our subsidiaries is fantastic and I expect that to continue. We went through what I'll call challenging times over the last year dealing with COVID and the focus by our subsidiaries on cost management without penalizing the labor force. Just looking for efficiencies and doing the leanest things they could, has been extraordinary.  And I think that will continue, so I don't expect big changes in the pattern you're seeing. Now, as sales pick up, we will have an investment in receivables. That will happen. I think our inventory is at the right levels right now. The only change I could see is an investment in receivables. But I do anticipate capitals to be strong for this year.\nPeter Arment: I appreciate all the colors. Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: Bye, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmolli from Trust Securities. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nMichael Ciarmolli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I don't know, Eric or Carlos, maybe just to put a finer point on this. This quarter is normally a little bit slower in general, coming off the heavy flying season, we've seen this pick up in Delta here, and I guess you're not going to get the guidance, but if I look at FSG sequential growth, streets got you guys at 13% into the fourth quarter.  Given what we're seeing, the softer, as you already telegraphed last quarter, Eric, that 16 wasn't sustainable, but is that too heavy, or do you guys have orders and confirmation that you'll see a step-up in sequential growth into this current quarter we're in now?\nCarlos Macau: Michael, this is Carlos. I'll answer the first part of that. Maybe Eric will have the follow-up. Because of the uncertainties we're seeing in the marketplace, and it's real; stops, starts, the trend is there. But we have -- we had challenges of the order patterns as the Delta virus variant kicked off. That's why we didn't give guidance.  I don't want to comment on 13%, 20%, 5%. I -- we really don't know. I can tell you that I think in general, the sales will continue to trend up. We've said consistently for quite some time that we think it's more of a linear pattern upward. That's why we were surprised in Q2 at the growth in FSG. But I think we'll continue this pace back up to ' 19 levels towards the end of '22 on a trailing to at the end of the year.  And I think that's what people should expect anything above that will be gravy and will make us all happy, but we're not expecting lumpiness in the patterns quarter by quarter, more of just a linear progression up.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think that's a great and very accurate response, Carlos. The only thing that I would add, and also on what you're bringing up here as well as some of the prior questions, is that it's very difficult to predict when the restocking is going to occur. We don't believe that we've seen much restocking to date because our AOG orders have been fairly strong.  If people are needing parts right away, they don't have them on the shelf. That leads me to believe that there is a lot of pent-up demand yet to come. And I keep mentioning from Europe and Asia ex-China. So, but Mike, it's really hard to predict when it's going to hit. As you know, we get roughly 70% of our orders in the monthly shipment.  So, I really don't have -- we don't have visibility to be able to see that. We know that we're winning market share. We know we're developing products. We know that our people are more pumped up than ever. And so, I think that we're going to do exceptionally well and people will continue to fly. I'm sure you've -- you've been flying. Everyone's itching to fly And -- but when that occurs is very hard to predict.\nMichael Ciarmolli: Got it.\nEric Mendelson: Yes.\nMichael Ciarmolli: Yes. Got it. That's fair. What about -- are you getting any indications, Eric, either from your people or from airlines? We've been talking about maybe when this restocking happened. But presumably, the bulk of your demand right now coming from narrow-bodies, should we expect, assuming vaccinations continue to happen here and knock-on wood, maybe international travel starts to really recover.  Is there an expectation from you guys that maybe we get a little bit of a bow-wave of activity to support some of the widebodies out there in the fleet that presumably are still very much underutilized in terms of daily utilization flight activity as those starts to pick up?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I think that will start. But frankly, the wide-body is really going to be more trans-oceanic traffic. And my guess is that recovery is shifted more to the right in probably in getting prepared for next summer, my sense is next summer is going to be very strong. It's interesting when I look at our Asia n facilities, the vaccination rate is somewhere between 90 and 100%. Our people are vaccinated, at least with one shot.  And we've been very careful in how we're operating, but we're doing quite well out there. This leads me to believe that there is going to be a big surge in travel. People are going to want to go to Europe, to Asia. They're going to want to come here. I think wide-body come -- the spring is wide-body demand for parts is going to start taking off and it will be delayed just like the narrow-body was, but it's going to be there. So, we feel good about it.\nMichael Ciarmolli: Got it. Okay. Maybe just one last one for Carlos. The FSG operating margins, you know, very strong sequential growth. I think 3% revenue growth, 18% operating growth, great leverage there. Really high sequential, incremental margins. Can that sort of margin expansion continues? Should we be thinking about costs starting to be layered back in, as that top line continues to ramp, or just how should we calibrate ourselves for margin and expansion and cadence going forward?\nCarlos Macau: I think the best way, Michael, for you to look at that is to trend the operating margin up with the revenue growth. We ultimately expect the Flight Support group get back to 20% GAAP operating margins. And I think if you trend that upwards with the model on revenue growth, you're going to be pretty much in line with at least our expectations at this point.  As we rebounded, and as I've mentioned in prior calls, the incremental margins can be a little higher than our decrements because you have things like product flying off the shelf as opposed to manufacturing, right? You can get a bigger bang for the incremental dollar than on the downside. And so, we saw that this quarter, but I wouldn't assume massive leaps in our OI margin. I would trend it with sales growth and get your model back to around 20%.  And then at that point, I think what will happen is we'll react similarly to how we have in the past. You have this incremental bump ups in the margin as time passes through efficiencies and growth in sales. Does that help?\nMichael Ciarmolli: Got it. Perfect, thanks. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you for the time. I'll start with maybe ETG. Victor, I don't want you to feel left out. So, what's going on in ETG organic growth looks pretty good up by branded on easy comp. But we've seen a lot of suppliers really decelerate in their defense business. So maybe if you could talk about what you're seeing in Defense and Space because I believe that accounts for 60% of ETG sales. What's going on, and should we expect any air pockets or softness?\nVictor Mendelson: Hi Sheila, this is Victor. I would say that overall, the business is, as we pointed out in the numbers, it was pretty much firing on just about all cylinders this quarter. That's -- the outlook, I think is pretty healthy. It's -- not every business is as strong as the other businesses. I think we've said over time, we expect the defense to flatten out at the very least, with the budgets. The budget is not resolved as you know, and so we would expect that to be the case going forward.  We would expect space to be strong. We think our other markets right now should continue overall to be strong. Of course, that's predicated on what happens in the overall economy and with the viruses. But right now, what we see is general strength and recovery as well in our commercial aviation markets. And when I refer to space, I refer generally to commercial space, but also our defense space. And I think we'll just have to see where defense plays out over time. We tend not to just look quarter-to-quarter, as you know.  And in defense, I think we've constructed the business pretty well to avoid the operations tempo, although we're certainly not free from that. And we've always tried to stay more focused on the higher technology realms that are not so much involved with the engagements that our country is involved in and that we're involved in a -- more involved with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, to a certain extent, standoff warfare and things like that. And that generally tends not to be as volatile. Of course, we'll have to see how that plays out, but that's been the strategy.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. No, that's helpful color. And then Larry, for you, your favorite topic. I think you guys raised your dividends, and you also did three acquisitions within FSG over the last few months. What are you seeing in the market, whether it's for M&A or using your balance sheet? And just given recent deals with Meggit and Parker and TransDigm, how do you guys approach -- what is a rational estimate for synergies as a percentage of sales? How do you guys see that, and just your overall thoughts on the market?\nLawrence Mendelson: Well, I think overall, we are looking at quite a large number of transactions. We're doing due diligence on them. Some of these big transactions, specifically you mentioned the TransDigm and Parker with regard to Meggit, I think that both of them are paying very high prices for that. We looked at -- we model dozens of public companies to see what they might look like combined with HEICO.  And they are -- we think they're paying a very high price, but they also feel that they can get great synergies. And I would say that they're both very good companies, and I assume that they know what they're doing. It's probably richer than our blood could stand, but I wish them good luck and success in those acquisitions. We are looking at a large number of companies. We certainly have the balance sheet and the capacity to do large transactions.  And our nature is to be more conservative, of course than TransDigm, which you know. And our model is a little bit different than TransDigm but I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities and we're working on it. So, the problem is a lot of private equity and other -- money is very cheap. And people are pushing up. I think there is basic inflation in the M&A world. People are paying very high prices, and we are a little bit conservative on that.  And also, because our model is a decentralized model, we don't go in and clean house with acquisition and throw people out of jobs and all that kind of stuff. So again, we have to be a little bit careful in how we do things. But there are enough transactions -- potential transactions out there that will enable us to close on our fair share of what's available.  So, I'm cautiously optimistic. I think with us, it will be sort of business as usual. It is harder because we are competing with a lot of people with a lot of cash in their pocket, and it's burning a hole in their pocket. We probably won't be as aggressive as those people. But that is just our style, and it's worked for 31 years. I think we'll continue pretty much the way we are.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Awesome. But thank you for the color.\nLawrence Mendelson: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nGautam Khanna: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nVictor Mendelson: Morning.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, I have a couple of questions. First, at FSG, I was curious about the sequential trend within the quarter. Was the exit rate in July -- sales in July, were they substantially different than that of the preceding 2 months? Were there any fits and starts you saw through the quarter? Anything you could talk about just within the quarter, what the trend flows?\nVictor Mendelson: No, not -- Gautam, it's Eric. No, I wouldn't say that we saw any real particular trends within the quarter. Just sort of gradual upward shift. But it's -- no, nothing that really stands out.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And then within the segment of FSG, we have the 3 major sub-segments. Any major differences between the 3? Specialized products, repairs, and aftermarket parts and services.\nCarlos Macau: Hey, Gautam. This is Carlos, how are you?\nGautam Khanna: Great, thank you.\nCarlos Macau: The repair group was quite strong in Q3, which by the way, we expected. But it performed quite nicely. It had -- it really, really done a good job. Parts and repair were way up and again, we expected that. The -- I don't want to harp on this too much, but the laggard, if you would, the slowest growing part of the segment, was specialty products.  And again, we anticipated that the OEM cycle is a little softer than the aftermarket. So, we anticipate that, but it's growing nicely and we're happy with its performance. And you'll see the breakout if you look at our -- will file our quarter on Thursday so you'll be able to see the trend in the sales by those 2 areas. Gautam --\nEric Mendelson: This is Eric. That's why Carlos just pointed out with the specialty products growing the least out of the group, although the smallest percentage, that's why we've got a lot of confidence that when that -- as that recovers, that we're going to have a nice rebound there because we haven't seen that yet. We have -- we've seen some, but not to the full extent.\nGautam Khanna: That makes sense. And then, Victor, I was just curious within the ETG Group, there's -- it's not all defense. It's -- there's Aero-defense, and then there's other industrial markets, medical, whatever. I was curious, anything you could speak about the non-defense, the non - Aero businesses within ETG and how they trended in the quarter, and what visibility looks like in the upcoming quarters? Thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. Hey, Gautam. This is Victor. Those businesses have been very strong and actually gaining momentum throughout the year. And we're seeing strong demand. And they're not without supply chain challenges, in fact. But we have never been one of them just in time inventory companies in our own policies.  So, we haven't really had to contend much with those challenges. I anticipate that as the year wears on, we might see some here and there, but we've been able to navigate those very successfully. And that's a sign, frankly, that we might encounter a little more of those in a nice level, that demand is just very, very strong there. And it doesn't seem to be subsiding. And that's across-the-board in the various markets that we serve. It's not just limited to one individual market, let's say.  So right now, we're very pleased with how those businesses are proceeding. And we've seen a nice recovery as well in some of the medical products and markets that we serve, that had been affected of course by the pandemic, and an improvement in demand there. And obviously, its procedures were put on hold in the middle or early part of 2020. Those recoveries have been good for us as well. So those feel pretty good for us too.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Thank you, Victor. And then, Larry, for you. Last one from me. Just wanted to ask about your comments on the Parker people paying high prices and all that. I am curious, are there any larger transactions you guys are looking at or is the pipeline today filled with more of the typical HEICO acquisition profile mid-sized, small-size tuck-ins? Or is there an opportunity here to, while the cycle is still early, go bigger? Is that something you guys are keen to do or? Anything you could say about that would be helpful.\nLawrence Mendelson: So, the answer is yes, we are looking, as I heard mentioned earlier in this call, we are looking at larger companies. Sometimes, we can't make the numbers work, at least in our decentralized operation, where we don't go in and cut and do those types of things. But we are looking at larger companies and standard companies, and all sized companies. And we run models consistently.  Our M&A people, in addition to investment banking people who call us every -- virtually every day to look at this possibility and this possibility. So, we certainly have the financial ability to do large transactions in the multi-billion-dollar size. And our balance sheet is pristine, you know that. And we are trying our very best to -- the idea that we have is not to grow because of size top-line, biggest sales Company but to be the most profitable Company that generates the most cash.  So, to us, an acquisition is really all about cash. Yes, earnings per share and so forth. But for example, on these calls, what we haven't focused on is, and I'm sure that many, many people on the call, analysts and investors, focus on cash. I know that because when we have one-on-one conferences and conversations, that's what they talk about. In my opinion, running HEICO, managing HEICO, it's all about what the EBITDA looks like and what is the cash flow looking like.  And that's the critical factor. When we make an acquisition, it's all about cash flow return on our investment. Not to become the biggest Company in aerospace or electronics, or anything else. That's what we really focus on it. And we find -- if you really do the arithmetic, we find that on medium-size acquisitions at the right price and the right Company, we've can generate as much or more cash than we can generate on very large companies.  So, this is a -- be assured that Carlos, Eric, Victor, me, our M&A guys, we're looking at this virtually 24/7. So again, it's all different sizes, but the bottom line to us is number 1, cash flow to earnings per share.\nLawrence Mendelson: Because if we have cash flow, we'll have earnings per share. But if we have earnings per share, we might be heavily leveraged and we won't have cash flow. That's a possibility, as you know. We put that all into the model, and we try to figure out what is the best total overall result for HEICO for an acquisition. But yes, we're looking at all sizes.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nNoah Poponak: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLawrence Mendelson: Good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: So, in the aerospace aftermarket, I'm hearing you say no major sequential change month-by-month through the quarter. I'm hearing you say that airlines are generally still concerned about not being ready for recovery, as opposed to being incrementally worried about COVID. And I'm hearing you say that you expect 4Q revenue up sequentially and that's with a month under your belt.  And then also a period that usually transitions a little bit to business from leisure. And so, I guess, maybe less of a question and more of making sure I have the summary correct because we've heard some other companies say that the exit rate of the June quarter was worse than the entry rate. And suggest that airlines have gone on a little bit of a pause in aftermarket purchasing activity because they are worried about the Delta variant.  Just want to confirm that I have it correct that you're not really seeing it that way. That you've seen domestic leisure strong, international business weak, and Delta just keeps it there for the time being. And you're not seeing really incremental weakness that you are concerned about within your aerospace aftermarket business.\nEric Mendelson: Hi, Noah. It's Eric. There's a lot of information in there. But basically, I would agree with what you said with -- just, one little caveat. On the international side, I don't think it's only business. I think it's a lot of leisure travel as well. That international hasn't picked up, so my comment was more overall that I think international has got good potential to go up against number 1. And number 2, Europe hasn't recovered, and Asia ex-China has not recovered.\nNoah Poponak: Correct.\nEric Mendelson: I would say, yes,\nNoah Poponak: But that was all true pre-Delta variant. I guess what I'm saying is, it sounds like your summary is that the Delta variant of COVID-19 has not really significantly changed the trend line in your aerospace aftermarket business for now?\nEric Mendelson: For now, that is correct. I was asked to comment on what I thought would come down the road. And since Europe hasn't recovered, Asia, ex-China hasn't recovered. Of course, the OEM cycle is building, and we've got significant market share gains, which I answered the way that I did. But yes, look and I think it's possible that HEICO does a bit better than other companies because of these various points that we just spoke about.  And -- but obviously, it's very difficult to anticipate, specifically what the fourth quarter is going to. Yes, we do have -- you're right. We've got 3.5 weeks under our belt, but I don't have full numbers for August yet. We never know what the subsidiaries are going to do until they post those numbers. So, I won't know until basically September 1st, what the month looks like. And it's very difficult to predict because we've seen -- our guys tend to be fairly conservative.  So, the trend tends to be right before the end of the month. They're always way low and they end up coming in higher. Until I see that, I don't know what it is. I would caution against being too aggressive for the fourth quarter because I mentioned the Delta variant. It's obviously not good news for the United States, nor for the rest of the world. But from what we've seen thus far, it's not crippling at all.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And I recognized I packed a lot into that question there. But the overall overarching summary, I think I understand. Does HEICO have more exposure to what's happening with the parked fleet and aircraft coming back into service? I know you have a, I think, significant-sized structures component repair group business.  And maybe there are other exposures there. But in addition to -- usually traffic and parked are linked, but to the extent that aircraft are coming back into the service at a faster clip than traffic or those are just different. Is that meaningful for HEICO?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. The -- look, I think overall the aftermarket, not only for HEICO but for the industry is obviously, you got to look at 20-something thousand aircraft out there. And by definition, most of those -- the ones that were parked-were basically in need of maintenance. They didn't park the ones that didn't need maintenance.  So yes, as demand gets added back, they've got to put money into the fleet. So, I think that is one of the situations that we've seen. However, we do ultimately anticipate a restocking and ultimately, of course, the rest of the world returning to normal. My sense is it's going to be pretty -- those attributes are going to be present over the next year, as well.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And then just last question. The share gain that you've referred to, any way to quantify that? I mean, how much revenue have you added to the PMA business over the last 18 months from share gain? Or I know it's not just in PMA, but any way to even directionally size what you've accomplished there?\nEric Mendelson: It's hard to -- for me to present what those numbers are because they're occurring in many different areas. And it's difficult to see in the numbers. I mean, yes, we know what we're doing in terms of new products. But also, you got to combine that with the recovery in other markets, you got to look at how additional share gain is going to impact this, going forward. So, it becomes very difficult to identify, to call out.\nCarlos Macau: Part of the problem -- this is Carlos. Part of the problem might be is because we track the share gains by customers. And we certainly don't want to talk about customers on this call, but we're very aware of our market share with each airline globally that we serve. And we are seeing that they're buying more. And they're buying things that, or they're putting in orders for things that they had not bought in before. We believe that that trend that we're seeing is a result of gaining market share from our customer base.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto from UBS. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nLouis Raffetto: Hey. Good morning, everybody.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nVictor Mendelson: Morning.\nLouis Raffetto: Eric, I wanted to circle back with you on the Ridge - Bechdon deal. As you talked about Flight Support getting back to '19 levels by the end of '22, can you -- how much impact does that deal have on that? And sticking with them, I know the deal didn't close till early 4Q. Sorry. I'm guessing we're not going to know what you spent on that until the 10-K or any guidance you can give us on those 2 things just as we think about cash balances and things like that going into the end of the year?\nCarlos Macau: Louis, this is Carlos. We didn't disclose the purchase price because the acquisition relative to our balance sheet was not material. We have a big balance sheet. I wouldn't look at them being a drain on cash or we pay with cash on hand in our -- the beginning of this month. So, if you look at our cash balance, whatever we had sitting around, we usually operate with probably half of what we got on the balance sheet. So, some of that went towards the acquisition.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Eric, any impact, I guess, on the top line? You can just help us -- because again, it does seem like it's a bigger deal within FSG than you've done in a while. So, if there's anything.\nEric Mendelson: It's a nice-sized Company. I mean, they've got about 200 people. They are in the manufacturing business and they're really a very outstanding Company. We're really honored to be the home that they've selected for this business. And we think that there were a lot of people who would have coveted buying the Company. And they saw the culture that HEICO has got. And really our long-term commitment and the fact that we don't sell companies and that we just build and grow them.  They're going to be embarking on additional growth in terms of more buildings, more equipment. We're very excited about that. We've spoken with major customers and they're extremely well valued. And really the furthest ahead in that space, according to our customers. And so, we're really very, very optimistic that it's going to provide another great avenue for growth. Just good business with really great people.  We're very optimistic and it's again a nice adjacent wide space for us. We never did machining or bracing like this, frankly, I'd never seen this elsewhere. What they've been able to pioneer and develop, it started out as a very small Company. And due to the grit and determination of the founders and leaders in the business and all the people, they've been able to do stuff that other people viewed as really impossible.  And frankly, I've barely -- I've seen quite a bit of machining in my 31 years at HEICO, and I've never seen anything like Ridge. The machining and the brazing that they do is really very, very close tolerance, very difficult to do. And I don't think anybody else in the world can really do these kinds of products.  So, I think it's just a very good opportunity for us, and it's one of the reasons I'm very optimistic about our specialty products business, that we're going to see continued demand as the cycle builds over on the commercial side. And then with these products and some of the other stuff we're doing on the military side while I'm -- why I'm very optimistic on it.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay, that's great. Thank you.\nLouis Raffetto: Carlos, just another one for you, I guess the corporate cost looks like another quarter of pretty high. Is this a new sustainable level? Anything else -- one time in nature in there, just to be mindful of as we think forward?\nCarlos Macau: I think we had -- the only thing really in the corporate cost center that's up is performance-based comp expense. And I think going into -- the first quarter was like Q2. We had a little bit more -- Q3 was more on the run rate. So, I think what you'll see Louis is if you look for anywhere from 1.8 to 2% of revenues, that's about what our corporate cost center will -- will amount to for any given year.  So that's what I'd focus on if you're modeling. But the only there's no unusual stuff that really is just related to hopefully having bonuses this year. Remember, we didn't have any last year, so the comparable to the prior year are low principally related to the performance-based comp being absent in 2020.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. That's right. And just a quick one. Larry, you talked a lot about the M&A, and obviously, you guys have been extremely successful in doing that over the last 30 years. I guess maybe the question is, has that landscape changed at all, given all this new competition that you're seeing? And what people are willing to pay and get and then combine that with your conservative nature?\nLawrence Mendelson: Well, as I indicated earlier, people are paying much higher prices because there is an inflation in our A, in our economy and you see that, just read the newspaper and they tell you that prices of goods and services are going up to number 1. And the M&A world is seeing the same thing, low-interest rates, just a plethora of money. And the definition of inflation is more money chasing the same amount of goods.  Obviously, we are getting inflation in acquisition. The question is, can we invest HEICO's money wisely to get the type of return that makes sense? That becomes more difficult when you're competing with somebody who is willing to pay 14 times EBITDA. And it takes you 20, 25 years to repay your investment. So, we look at things as a return, as you would as a wise investor, which you are, as a return on investment.  And we like to get our money back within, say, 10 years. And our model is that -- and we pay fair prices, will pay 8 times, 10 times EBITDA. And -- but we want to see the cash flow coming back so that if we mentally say we pay whatever we pay for it, by the time we're into the fourth or fifth year of owning a Company, we have received enough cashback to make that Company costing us in our portfolio, say 4x or 5x EBITDA.  It becomes a no-brainer. And that has been our strategy. But if we have to pay prices that take us 20 years to do that, all of a sudden, we wind up going to the banks and getting heavily indebted, which we don't -- again, our strategy is to be relatively low leverage. And we can't do that if it takes us 20 or 25 years to recoup our investment s. So, we do that study and that's our model.  In our model, we've been able to grow without being heavily indebted for the past 31 years. And we've grown at a compound rate of I don't know, 19% or the stock has grown at 24% of whatever it is. And that's the model we want to stick to. We had a board meeting the other day we discussed it. And basically, the board is in agreement with that. So not to say there aren't opportunities for us to acquire companies that are strong cash flow generators and will give us and our shareholders holders a return on their investment.  But there are a lot of companies going at 14 and 16 times EBITDA and you make all kinds of assumptions, you can justify any acquisition. You cannot justify a 20 times EBITDA price if you assume that the synergies are going to be God knows what. We're a little more conservative and we don't do that. I can't tell you. Is that the smartest thing? I don't know. except that we've done 80-some acquisitions and we've never had one blow upon us.  And our history is very clear. So that's our strategy and I think we're sticking to that. But I believe there will be enough. It's harder. We have to look at more companies to get one good acquisition than we've looked at in the past. But we will do that and we will continue to do it. And I'm convinced that we will be successful going forward.  I mean, we have a very, very experienced M&A group with Eric, Victor, Carlos, other people that worked on it, myself included. So, I am confident that we will continue to exceed expectations in M&A. But believe me, it is really tough. Tough because people are paying price.\nLouis Raffetto: That's great. I really appreciate all the color, Larry.\nOperator: There is no further question at this time you may continue.\nLawrence Mendelson: I do want to thank the people that have turned into this conference and shown interest in HEICO. We appreciate your interest and your support over the years. As you all know, Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself we're available. If you call us, email us, we'll discuss if you have questions that we can answer without running into problems and SEC problems, disclosure problems. We'll be very happy to discuss things. Anything that we can discuss openly, we'll be happy to. Our doors and telephones are open to you. And we welcome any call that you may want to make. We will talk to you. I guess the fourth quarter, we don't report until the middle towards the end of December, probably in the middle of December. So, we look forward to speaking with you at that time. And in the meantime, let us know if you have any questions, but again, thank you very much. And this ends our formal call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "Thank you very much. And good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to this HEICO Third Quarter Fiscal '21 Earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning, by Eric Mendelson, HEICO 's, Co-President and President of HEICO 's Flight Support Group. Victor Mendelson, HEICO 's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group. And Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before beginning my review of the operating result, I'd like to take a moment and recognize all of HEICO 's talented team members for their extraordinarily high performance during the challenging times brought on by COVID-19. The dedication to HEICO's customers and the safety of their fellow team members continues to be exceptional in our opinion. On behalf of our Board of Directors and management, I want to thank each and every member of HEICO 's worldwide team for these efforts and the outstanding results that we are reporting today. I will now summarize the highlights of our third quarter and first 9 months of Fiscal '21. We were very pleased to report consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 21 improved 47% and 22% respectively as compared to the Third Quarter of Fiscal 20, which was the Quarter in which our operating results were most negatively affected by the pandemic. Our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net Sales growth of 17%, as well as the favorable impact from our Fiscal '20 and ' 21 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 250% and 33%, in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal '20. These substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from some recovery in global, commercial air travel as compared to the prior year. In addition, this marks the 4th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. We are very pleased with this trend and we do expect to see it continue. The Electronic Technologies Group reported quarterly increases of 14% and 11% in net sales and operating incomes respectively, as compared to the third quarter of Fiscal '20. These increases principally reflect the impact from our profitable Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, as well as strong organic net sales for the majority of our products. Our total debt to shareholders equity improved to 17.4% as of July 31, '21, and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of a 117.1 million as of July 31, compared to shareholders equity ratio improved to a very low 5.3% as of 07/31/21. And that was down from 16.6% as of October 3120. Obviously, we are not a heavily leveraged Company and we have a lot of debt capacity and the ability for acquisition and growth. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.25% as of 07/31/2021. Down from 0.71 times as of 10/31/2020. During Fiscal '21, we successfully completed four acquisitions and have no significant debt maturities until Fiscal '24. We plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong, increasing 33% to a 124 billion in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 93.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, increasing 12% to 334.1 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 299 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. In July '21, we paid a regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.09 per share. And this represented our 86th consecutive semi-annual cash dividend. And it was 12.5% higher than the $0.08 per share cash dividend we paid in January '21. In 06/21, we acquired 81 -- 80.1% of the assets of Camtronics and FAA certified part 145 repair station with extensive proprietary FAA designated engineering representative repairs. The remaining 19.9% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Camtronics management team, as well as certain members of the management team, of an existing HEICO Flight Support subsidiary. Camtronics is part of HEICO Flight Support, and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. Earlier this month, we acquired 89% of rin -- Ridge Engineering and the Bechdon Company. Ridge is a leading -- a leader in performing tight tolerance machining and brazing of large-sized parts in mission-critical defense and aerospace applications. Bechdon provides machining, fabrication, and welding services for aerospace defense and other industrial applications. The remaining 11% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Ridge's and Bechdon management team. These companies are now part of HEICO 's Flight Support Group, and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO 's Flight Support Group. And he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you Victor and Eric. Moving on to earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share increased 40% to $0.56 in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up from $0.40 in the third quarter of Fiscal 20. The increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects previously mentioned higher operating income at both operating segments. Consolidated net income per diluted share was a $1.58 in the first nine months of fiscal 21, and that compared to a $1.83 in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The decrease in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher income tax expense and lower operating income of Flight Support, partially offset by higher operating income of the Electronic Technologies Group. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled 22.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up slightly from 21.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20 and totaled 68.8 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 65.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in the third quarter and first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflect the incremental impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions. Research and development expense increased to $18 million or 3.8% of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 15.1 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. R&D expense increased to 52.2 million or 3.8% of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that was up from 49 million or 3.6% of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. As usual, significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. Our consolidated SG&A expenses with 83.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 and that compared to 75 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense, higher other SG&A expense, and the impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Consolidated SG&A expenses were 245.1 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 232.8 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expenses in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense and the impact from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, and partially offset by reductions in bad debt expense and other SG&A expense. The Company's lower bad debt expense in the first 9 months and third quarter of Fiscal '21 reflects higher bad debt expense in the first 9 months in third quarter of Fiscal '20, and that was due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of Fiscal '20 as a result of the pandemic's financial impact. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 17.8% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. And that was down from 19.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21. Principally reflects lower bad debt expense, as well as efficiency gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was a18.1% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21. And that compared to 17.1% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Interest expense decreased to $1.7 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was down from $2.6 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The decrease was principally due to lower weighted average balance on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. An interest expense decreased to 6.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, down from 10.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. That decrease was principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first 9 months and third quarter was not significant. Our effective tax rate was 15.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that was up from 13.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The increase principally reflects a larger deduction related to foreign derived intangible income, principally resulting from final tax regulations that were issued in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 was 13.3%, and that compared to 3.5% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. As previously discussed in a prior quarterly teleconference, HEICO recognized a larger discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in the first quarter of Fiscal '20 compared to Fiscal '21. And that accounted for the majority of the increase in the year-to-date effective tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender value of life insurance policy related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation plan. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $6.8 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 3.2 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 18.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, and that compared to 16.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in both the third quarter, Fiscal '21, and the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, principally reflects higher allocation of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain Fiscal '20 acquisitions and an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of Flight Support and ETG in which non-controlling interests are held. For the full Fiscal '21 year, we now estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate between 22% and 23% of pre -tax income. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 41 days as of July 20 -- 31, '21. And that was down from 43 days as of July 31, '20. Of course, we monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit exposure. No 1 customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. And our top 5 customers represented approximately 22% and 25% of consolidated net sales in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate improved to 150 days for the period ending 07/31/21. And that compared to 154 days for the period ending 07/31/20. Now, for the outlook. Looking ahead to the remainder of Fiscal '21 and to Fiscal '22, we remain cautiously optimistic that the on-going worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will positively influence commercial air travel and will benefit the markets we serve. But as we have all learned, it is difficult to predict the pandemic's path and effect, including factors like vaccination rates, new variants, which can impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide Fiscal '21 net sales and earnings guidance at this time, nor for '22. However, our ongoing conservative policies, very strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity, enable us to invest in new R&D, execute on our successful acquisition program, and position HEICO for market share gains as the industry recovers. Again, in closing, I would like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Without their unwavering passion to exceed customer expectation, our outstanding quarterly results would not be possible. Thank you for making HEICO such an excellent and unique Company. I also want to thank our loyal shareholder base that recognizes that the future -- or believes, as we do, that the future is very bright, and continue to hold our shares and support our efforts. Thank you. And now I'd like to open the floor for questions. So, Larry, that's a very difficult question to ask. It's like asking a fortune-teller what's in my future? So, it's so difficult because of things like the new Delta version of COVID pop-up. All of a sudden, we were on the street. Restaurants are pulling back. The people are saying, well -- hesitating and so forth. My personal opinion is that we will continue to grow through the remainder of '20 -- I'm talking about Flight Support. We'll grow through the remainder of '21 and certainly into '22. Again, we're cautious because what is going to happen, will the other shoe drop? Assuming that we don't have another shoe dropping and another version of COVID or some other unusual event, or the Afghanis attacking Mr. Biden or something, but yes, assuming things are kind of normal, I see continued strength and growth in our markets.  But, to go out on a limb and predict it and tell shareholders we're definitely going to do it, that's just not been our style. We don't hype the stocks. We try our best, but I have a very positive outlook. I can't -- based upon what I see, I feel very positive. But could something else happen? Yes. I'd like Eric to add to that if you don't mind. Morning, Josh. Good morning. Well, I think overall, we are looking at quite a large number of transactions. We're doing due diligence on them. Some of these big transactions, specifically you mentioned the TransDigm and Parker with regard to Meggit, I think that both of them are paying very high prices for that. We looked at -- we model dozens of public companies to see what they might look like combined with HEICO.  And they are -- we think they're paying a very high price, but they also feel that they can get great synergies. And I would say that they're both very good companies, and I assume that they know what they're doing. It's probably richer than our blood could stand, but I wish them good luck and success in those acquisitions. We are looking at a large number of companies. We certainly have the balance sheet and the capacity to do large transactions.  And our nature is to be more conservative, of course than TransDigm, which you know. And our model is a little bit different than TransDigm but I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities and we're working on it. So, the problem is a lot of private equity and other -- money is very cheap. And people are pushing up. I think there is basic inflation in the M&A world. People are paying very high prices, and we are a little bit conservative on that.  And also, because our model is a decentralized model, we don't go in and clean house with acquisition and throw people out of jobs and all that kind of stuff. So again, we have to be a little bit careful in how we do things. But there are enough transactions -- potential transactions out there that will enable us to close on our fair share of what's available.  So, I'm cautiously optimistic. I think with us, it will be sort of business as usual. It is harder because we are competing with a lot of people with a lot of cash in their pocket, and it's burning a hole in their pocket. We probably won't be as aggressive as those people. But that is just our style, and it's worked for 31 years. I think we'll continue pretty much the way we are. Okay. So, the answer is yes, we are looking, as I heard mentioned earlier in this call, we are looking at larger companies. Sometimes, we can't make the numbers work, at least in our decentralized operation, where we don't go in and cut and do those types of things. But we are looking at larger companies and standard companies, and all sized companies. And we run models consistently.  Our M&A people, in addition to investment banking people who call us every -- virtually every day to look at this possibility and this possibility. So, we certainly have the financial ability to do large transactions in the multi-billion-dollar size. And our balance sheet is pristine, you know that. And we are trying our very best to -- the idea that we have is not to grow because of size top-line, biggest sales Company but to be the most profitable Company that generates the most cash.  So, to us, an acquisition is really all about cash. Yes, earnings per share and so forth. But for example, on these calls, what we haven't focused on is, and I'm sure that many, many people on the call, analysts and investors, focus on cash. I know that because when we have one-on-one conferences and conversations, that's what they talk about. In my opinion, running HEICO, managing HEICO, it's all about what the EBITDA looks like and what is the cash flow looking like.  And that's the critical factor. When we make an acquisition, it's all about cash flow return on our investment. Not to become the biggest Company in aerospace or electronics, or anything else. That's what we really focus on it. And we find -- if you really do the arithmetic, we find that on medium-size acquisitions at the right price and the right Company, we've can generate as much or more cash than we can generate on very large companies.  So, this is a -- be assured that Carlos, Eric, Victor, me, our M&A guys, we're looking at this virtually 24/7. So again, it's all different sizes, but the bottom line to us is number 1, cash flow to earnings per share. Because if we have cash flow, we'll have earnings per share. But if we have earnings per share, we might be heavily leveraged and we won't have cash flow. That's a possibility, as you know. We put that all into the model, and we try to figure out what is the best total overall result for HEICO for an acquisition. But yes, we're looking at all sizes. Good morning, Noah. Well, as I indicated earlier, people are paying much higher prices because there is an inflation in our A, in our economy and you see that, just read the newspaper and they tell you that prices of goods and services are going up to number 1. And the M&A world is seeing the same thing, low-interest rates, just a plethora of money. And the definition of inflation is more money chasing the same amount of goods.  Obviously, we are getting inflation in acquisition. The question is, can we invest HEICO's money wisely to get the type of return that makes sense? That becomes more difficult when you're competing with somebody who is willing to pay 14 times EBITDA. And it takes you 20, 25 years to repay your investment. So, we look at things as a return, as you would as a wise investor, which you are, as a return on investment.  And we like to get our money back within, say, 10 years. And our model is that -- and we pay fair prices, will pay 8 times, 10 times EBITDA. And -- but we want to see the cash flow coming back so that if we mentally say we pay whatever we pay for it, by the time we're into the fourth or fifth year of owning a Company, we have received enough cashback to make that Company costing us in our portfolio, say 4x or 5x EBITDA.  It becomes a no-brainer. And that has been our strategy. But if we have to pay prices that take us 20 years to do that, all of a sudden, we wind up going to the banks and getting heavily indebted, which we don't -- again, our strategy is to be relatively low leverage. And we can't do that if it takes us 20 or 25 years to recoup our investment s. So, we do that study and that's our model.  In our model, we've been able to grow without being heavily indebted for the past 31 years. And we've grown at a compound rate of I don't know, 19% or the stock has grown at 24% of whatever it is. And that's the model we want to stick to. We had a board meeting the other day we discussed it. And basically, the board is in agreement with that. So not to say there aren't opportunities for us to acquire companies that are strong cash flow generators and will give us and our shareholders holders a return on their investment.  But there are a lot of companies going at 14 and 16 times EBITDA and you make all kinds of assumptions, you can justify any acquisition. You cannot justify a 20 times EBITDA price if you assume that the synergies are going to be God knows what. We're a little more conservative and we don't do that. I can't tell you. Is that the smartest thing? I don't know. except that we've done 80-some acquisitions and we've never had one blow upon us.  And our history is very clear. So that's our strategy and I think we're sticking to that. But I believe there will be enough. It's harder. We have to look at more companies to get one good acquisition than we've looked at in the past. But we will do that and we will continue to do it. And I'm convinced that we will be successful going forward.  I mean, we have a very, very experienced M&A group with Eric, Victor, Carlos, other people that worked on it, myself included. So, I am confident that we will continue to exceed expectations in M&A. But believe me, it is really tough. Tough because people are paying price. I do want to thank the people that have turned into this conference and shown interest in HEICO. We appreciate your interest and your support over the years. As you all know, Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself we're available. If you call us, email us, we'll discuss if you have questions that we can answer without running into problems and SEC problems, disclosure problems. We'll be very happy to discuss things. Anything that we can discuss openly, we'll be happy to. Our doors and telephones are open to you. And we welcome any call that you may want to make. We will talk to you. I guess the fourth quarter, we don't report until the middle towards the end of December, probably in the middle of December. So, we look forward to speaking with you at that time. And in the meantime, let us know if you have any questions, but again, thank you very much. And this ends our formal call. Thank you."

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Peter, thanks for the question. I was feeling lonely over there in the corner. Working Capital management on our subsidiaries is fantastic and I expect that to continue. We went through what I'll call challenging times over the last year dealing with COVID and the focus by our subsidiaries on cost management without penalizing the labor force. Just looking for efficiencies and doing the leanest things they could, has been extraordinary.  And I think that will continue, so I don't expect big changes in the pattern you're seeing. Now, as sales pick up, we will have an investment in receivables. That will happen. I think our inventory is at the right levels right now. The only change I could see is an investment in receivables. But I do anticipate capitals to be strong for this year. Bye, Peter. Michael, this is Carlos. I'll answer the first part of that. Maybe Eric will have the follow-up. Because of the uncertainties we're seeing in the marketplace, and it's real; stops, starts, the trend is there. But we have -- we had challenges of the order patterns as the Delta virus variant kicked off. That's why we didn't give guidance.  I don't want to comment on 13%, 20%, 5%. I -- we really don't know. I can tell you that I think in general, the sales will continue to trend up. We've said consistently for quite some time that we think it's more of a linear pattern upward. That's why we were surprised in Q2 at the growth in FSG. But I think we'll continue this pace back up to ' 19 levels towards the end of '22 on a trailing to at the end of the year.  And I think that's what people should expect anything above that will be gravy and will make us all happy, but we're not expecting lumpiness in the patterns quarter by quarter, more of just a linear progression up. I think the best way, Michael, for you to look at that is to trend the operating margin up with the revenue growth. We ultimately expect the Flight Support group get back to 20% GAAP operating margins. And I think if you trend that upwards with the model on revenue growth, you're going to be pretty much in line with at least our expectations at this point.  As we rebounded, and as I've mentioned in prior calls, the incremental margins can be a little higher than our decrements because you have things like product flying off the shelf as opposed to manufacturing, right? You can get a bigger bang for the incremental dollar than on the downside. And so, we saw that this quarter, but I wouldn't assume massive leaps in our OI margin. I would trend it with sales growth and get your model back to around 20%.  And then at that point, I think what will happen is we'll react similarly to how we have in the past. You have this incremental bump ups in the margin as time passes through efficiencies and growth in sales. Does that help? Hey, Gautam. This is Carlos, how are you? The repair group was quite strong in Q3, which by the way, we expected. But it performed quite nicely. It had -- it really, really done a good job. Parts and repair were way up and again, we expected that. The -- I don't want to harp on this too much, but the laggard, if you would, the slowest growing part of the segment, was specialty products.  And again, we anticipated that the OEM cycle is a little softer than the aftermarket. So, we anticipate that, but it's growing nicely and we're happy with its performance. And you'll see the breakout if you look at our -- will file our quarter on Thursday so you'll be able to see the trend in the sales by those 2 areas. Gautam -- Part of the problem -- this is Carlos. Part of the problem might be is because we track the share gains by customers. And we certainly don't want to talk about customers on this call, but we're very aware of our market share with each airline globally that we serve. And we are seeing that they're buying more. And they're buying things that, or they're putting in orders for things that they had not bought in before. We believe that that trend that we're seeing is a result of gaining market share from our customer base. Louis, this is Carlos. We didn't disclose the purchase price because the acquisition relative to our balance sheet was not material. We have a big balance sheet. I wouldn't look at them being a drain on cash or we pay with cash on hand in our -- the beginning of this month. So, if you look at our cash balance, whatever we had sitting around, we usually operate with probably half of what we got on the balance sheet. So, some of that went towards the acquisition. I think we had -- the only thing really in the corporate cost center that's up is performance-based comp expense. And I think going into -- the first quarter was like Q2. We had a little bit more -- Q3 was more on the run rate. So, I think what you'll see Louis is if you look for anywhere from 1.8 to 2% of revenues, that's about what our corporate cost center will -- will amount to for any given year.  So that's what I'd focus on if you're modeling. But the only there's no unusual stuff that really is just related to hopefully having bonuses this year. Remember, we didn't have any last year, so the comparable to the prior year are low principally related to the performance-based comp being absent in 2020."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Eric, thank you. And first, let me thank all of HEICO 's remarkably talented and dedicated team members who delivered yet again, on behalf of each other, on behalf of our customers and on behalf of our fellow shareholders this quarter, as you did throughout 2020 and throughout this year, and frankly before. And as you do in both good times and in challenging times, we are truly grateful for what you do and how you do it. And thank you to all of our team members. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 14% to $239.5 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $210.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally resulted from our Fiscal '20 and '21 acquisitions, as well as organic growth of 5%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand from our other electronic, defense, medical, and commercial aerospace products partially offset by decreased commercial space net sales. As we've historically noted, commercial space revenue recognitions tends to be uneven through the quarters due to factors like 606 accounting and periodic shifting of production resources between commercial and defense space work, which occurred this quarter and saw a total space activity overall in line with our expectations. Importantly, our space orders remain healthy. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 11% to a record $706.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, up from $638.3 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, principally reflects our Fiscal '20 and ' 21 acquisitions, as well as organic growth of 2%. The organic growth principally reflects decreased demand for our other electronic and defense products, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace and commercial space product sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 11% to $69 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $61.9 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a slightly lower gross profit margin mainly from the commercial space products net sales decrease. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 8% to a record $200.4 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, up from $184.9 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly from a less favorable product mix for defense products and the lower commercial space products net sales which in turn was partially offset by an increase in net sales of other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.8% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, as compared to 29.4% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.4% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 29% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The current year's third quarter and 9 month margins are within the anticipated range I frequently discussed on these calls, and remain excellent overall margins of which we and our team members are very proud. The operating margin change in the third quarter in 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin effects from the periodic commercial space sales shift. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Well, Larry, this is Victor. Of course, that, as you know, is part of the Flight Support Group being a mechanical manufacturing business and metals-based manufacturing business. And there is some opportunity for cross-selling with some of the things that the ETG does. I don't think it's going to be a tremendous needle mover. But there is some opportunity there, and we'll explore those as we get a little further down the road and a little more time passes. You're welcome. Hi Sheila, this is Victor. I would say that overall, the business is, as we pointed out in the numbers, it was pretty much firing on just about all cylinders this quarter. That's -- the outlook, I think is pretty healthy. It's -- not every business is as strong as the other businesses. I think we've said over time, we expect the defense to flatten out at the very least, with the budgets. The budget is not resolved as you know, and so we would expect that to be the case going forward.  We would expect space to be strong. We think our other markets right now should continue overall to be strong. Of course, that's predicated on what happens in the overall economy and with the viruses. But right now, what we see is general strength and recovery as well in our commercial aviation markets. And when I refer to space, I refer generally to commercial space, but also our defense space. And I think we'll just have to see where defense plays out over time. We tend not to just look quarter-to-quarter, as you know.  And in defense, I think we've constructed the business pretty well to avoid the operations tempo, although we're certainly not free from that. And we've always tried to stay more focused on the higher technology realms that are not so much involved with the engagements that our country is involved in and that we're involved in a -- more involved with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, to a certain extent, standoff warfare and things like that. And that generally tends not to be as volatile. Of course, we'll have to see how that plays out, but that's been the strategy. Morning. No, not -- Gautam, it's Eric. No, I wouldn't say that we saw any real particular trends within the quarter. Just sort of gradual upward shift. But it's -- no, nothing that really stands out. Sure. Hey, Gautam. This is Victor. Those businesses have been very strong and actually gaining momentum throughout the year. And we're seeing strong demand. And they're not without supply chain challenges, in fact. But we have never been one of them just in time inventory companies in our own policies.  So, we haven't really had to contend much with those challenges. I anticipate that as the year wears on, we might see some here and there, but we've been able to navigate those very successfully. And that's a sign, frankly, that we might encounter a little more of those in a nice level, that demand is just very, very strong there. And it doesn't seem to be subsiding. And that's across-the-board in the various markets that we serve. It's not just limited to one individual market, let's say.  So right now, we're very pleased with how those businesses are proceeding. And we've seen a nice recovery as well in some of the medical products and markets that we serve, that had been affected of course by the pandemic, and an improvement in demand there. And obviously, its procedures were put on hold in the middle or early part of 2020. Those recoveries have been good for us as well. So those feel pretty good for us too. Morning."

            "content": "Thank you very much. I'd like to start out by first thanking all of HEICO's team members for their incredible dedication, and in particular, their sacrifice in 2020. I think our shareholders and the community at large expect phenomenal results from HEICO. And they just automatically think that we're able to pump out these incredible results quarter-after-quarter. But the truth is that all of the businesses that we're in are very competitive businesses. And our people have to work incredibly hard. And last year, they went through tremendous sacrifices, tremendous personal sacrifices. And in order to help HEICO and looking at the results that we see now today, I believe is the result of that hard work and dedication. So I just personally thank all of the HEICO team members for everything that they've done to make our Company what it is today. Moving on to the prepared remarks, the Flight Support Group 's net sales increased 33% to 237.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from 178.2 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The net sales increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, is principally from organic growth of 32%. The organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's net sales were 666.7 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 731.2 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The net sales decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from a decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 250% to 42.1 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from $12 million in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating income increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, and an improved gross profit margin, mainly due to increased demand for our commercial aviation products. Additionally, we had a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of Fiscal '20 last year, as a result of the pandemic's financial impact. The Flight Support Group's operating income was 100 -- 103.4 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 as compared to 121.6 million in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The Operating income decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower net sales, as well as higher performance-based compensation expense in the impact from loss, fixed cost deficiencies stemming from the pandemic, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 17.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '21, up from 6.7% in the third quarter of Fiscal '20. The operating margin increase in the third quarter of Fiscal '21 principally reflects the previously mentioned increase in net sales, improved gross profit margin, and lower bad debt expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 15.5% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21, as compared to 16.6% in the first 9 months of Fiscal '20. The operating margin decreased in the first 9 months of Fiscal '21 principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned higher performance-based compensation expense in lost fixed cost efficiencies partly offset by the previously mentioned lower bad debt expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Hi, Larry. Good morning -- It's Eric, Great question and something we spend a lot of time talking about. I spent a lot of the last 2 weeks with our aftermarket leadership and sales and marketing folks, understanding what they're seeing and what their plans are. And I can tell you that they are all very optimistic. And I believe that we -- not I believe. We are continuing to take market share. We're doing very well in all of our businesses in the aftermarket.  I feel that since we were able to hang on to a greater percentage of our people than our competitors, that we are very well positioned for the recovery. Specifically, to answer your question, across-the-board, no. We have not seen a drop in business as a result of the Delta variant thus far. The Americas, in general, have been strong. Europe never saw really the recovery. In Asia, ex-China hasn't seen the recovery.  I think that we've got a lot of wind to our backs. And I think of a lot of increased demand to help drive the -- continue to drive the sales higher. Having said that, if you look at what's going on with the Delta variant in the United States, I think it's inevitable that there will be a little bit of a pullback here. I think people are continuing to travel for personal travel as well as for business meetings. I think where travel is being clipped, is in larger conventions. Larger group meetings. So, I don't -- we haven't seen it, but it would be logical for it to temper back a little bit. Of course, there's normally a little bit of a Fall pullback anyway. But again, since we haven't seen the rebound in Europe nor Asia, ex-China, I think that we've got a lot of very good potential there. So, I remain very optimistic. As far as when do we get back to the ' 19 levels? I certainly hope that by the end of '22, we are back at the '19 levels.  However, that is not to say that '22 will equal '19, because it's going to take a while to get back to those levels. I think the consensus in the industry is that 2023 should overall, for full-year, be equal to '19. And remember, our 2023 starts November 1st of 2022. I'm pretty optimistic about how we're doing. We feel good notwithstanding the recent news flow. Thanks, Larry. Yeah. Josh, that's a great question. I think something that a lot of people often overlook. But yes, HEICO, I'd -- we believe is the largest independent repair and overhaul group focusing on the components market in the world. And we say independent, mean, non - OEM, non-airline, non-government affiliated. And a key part of that strategy is using the DER repairs.  And when we combine that with the opportunity to use certain PMA parts, it results in an unbeatable combination. I can tell you that -- we operate a very decentralized business where we've got businesses that focus on a specific product and Camtronics is particularly good in a number of the products that it does, and it does have DERs.  I think we've got the ability to develop more DERs. And I think we're going to do very well because we offer it as a full suite. It's not just walking in and offering a single DER. It's offering lots of different DERs. So yes, I think that's been an important part of the strategy, along with the PMA. I think the stress is behind us, frankly. I feel good about where they are. And I can tell you looking at some of the older patterns and some of the stuff that they're ordering from us that they never bought from us before leads me to believe that HEICO is going to continue to take market share as they've got to focus on cost. And that HEICO has treated them very well through these crises. But I really think the airline distress is behind us. Thank you. Sure. I mentioned in the call -- in the second quarter call 3 months ago that the 16% really surprised us and we were frankly shocked to see it so strong. And I cautioned everybody at that time that I didn't see that continuing. And sure enough, that didn't continue at that 16% rate. But look, I'm very happy that we held the ground. When you go up 16%, often you can cut back, trim back. I was happy that we were able to post 3% above what was off the chart numbers. In hindsight, would it have looked good to have 10% growth and then 10% growth? Yes, but that's not how we manage it. I can tell the airlines with whom we deal are very optimistic and I've never spoken to our sales force before and seeing them so positive and optimistic. Now, part of that is due to us gaining market share in the PMA and the DER, as well as the distribution area. So, HEICO is doing very well because we were financially strong through the crisis.  We held on to a much larger percentage of our workforce than our competitors. So, I think we're starting to reap those benefits. It's very hard to figure out quarter-over-quarter increases. Again, the other -- the focus and -- the other point I want to make is that our businesses are focused on profitability. And if you see the profitability in the margin, it far outpaced the sales increase. We evaluate businesses on cash flow and profitability. Sales are sort of irrelevant.  As a matter of fact, if you have a lot of sales and not profitability, that's not a good thing at HEICO. We don't want to tie up capital in that. We'd rather invest capital in something that's going to produce income. I'm overjoyed, frankly, with the earnings that we've been able to put out while delivering very good savings to the customers. And I think that in North America, it's -- there's got to be some impact on flight schedules, but I think it's going to be at the margins.  And again, Europe and Asia, ex-China, haven't experienced the return. So, I think we've got far more upside in those areas than we do in some little potential risk in the United States. I got to say our -- the major operators in the United States are all without exception, very optimistic. And they want to make sure that they are going to get products and everybody is nervous about supply chain shortages.  There were articles in the Journal today about China not being able to -- not that we get our parts from China, but not being able to get enough labor for their factories, as well as COVID in Vietnam and all sorts of supply chain challenges. So, I think they're going to be pretty aggressive and leave those parts unordered, so I'm -- we're feeling good. Yeah. I would say that is correct. But I think in hindsight, some of the second quarter may have been a little bit of restocking for certain customers. No, there's not wholesale restocking going on. But in the Americas, the -- in North America, I think the airlines want to make sure that they've got enough parts on the shelf. Maybe there has been a little bit -- there was a little bit of that in the second quarter, but not to the full extent that we would anticipate. Yes. I think that's a great and very accurate response, Carlos. The only thing that I would add, and also on what you're bringing up here as well as some of the prior questions, is that it's very difficult to predict when the restocking is going to occur. We don't believe that we've seen much restocking to date because our AOG orders have been fairly strong.  If people are needing parts right away, they don't have them on the shelf. That leads me to believe that there is a lot of pent-up demand yet to come. And I keep mentioning from Europe and Asia ex-China. So, but Mike, it's really hard to predict when it's going to hit. As you know, we get roughly 70% of our orders in the monthly shipment.  So, I really don't have -- we don't have visibility to be able to see that. We know that we're winning market share. We know we're developing products. We know that our people are more pumped up than ever. And so, I think that we're going to do exceptionally well and people will continue to fly. I'm sure you've -- you've been flying. Everyone's itching to fly And -- but when that occurs is very hard to predict. Yes. Yeah. I think that will start. But frankly, the wide-body is really going to be more trans-oceanic traffic. And my guess is that recovery is shifted more to the right in probably in getting prepared for next summer, my sense is next summer is going to be very strong. It's interesting when I look at our Asia n facilities, the vaccination rate is somewhere between 90 and 100%. Our people are vaccinated, at least with one shot.  And we've been very careful in how we're operating, but we're doing quite well out there. This leads me to believe that there is going to be a big surge in travel. People are going to want to go to Europe, to Asia. They're going to want to come here. I think wide-body come -- the spring is wide-body demand for parts is going to start taking off and it will be delayed just like the narrow-body was, but it's going to be there. So, we feel good about it. Good morning. This is Eric. That's why Carlos just pointed out with the specialty products growing the least out of the group, although the smallest percentage, that's why we've got a lot of confidence that when that -- as that recovers, that we're going to have a nice rebound there because we haven't seen that yet. We have -- we've seen some, but not to the full extent. Good morning. Hi, Noah. It's Eric. There's a lot of information in there. But basically, I would agree with what you said with -- just, one little caveat. On the international side, I don't think it's only business. I think it's a lot of leisure travel as well. That international hasn't picked up, so my comment was more overall that I think international has got good potential to go up against number 1. And number 2, Europe hasn't recovered, and Asia ex-China has not recovered. I would say, yes, For now, that is correct. I was asked to comment on what I thought would come down the road. And since Europe hasn't recovered, Asia, ex-China hasn't recovered. Of course, the OEM cycle is building, and we've got significant market share gains, which I answered the way that I did. But yes, look and I think it's possible that HEICO does a bit better than other companies because of these various points that we just spoke about.  And -- but obviously, it's very difficult to anticipate, specifically what the fourth quarter is going to. Yes, we do have -- you're right. We've got 3.5 weeks under our belt, but I don't have full numbers for August yet. We never know what the subsidiaries are going to do until they post those numbers. So, I won't know until basically September 1st, what the month looks like. And it's very difficult to predict because we've seen -- our guys tend to be fairly conservative.  So, the trend tends to be right before the end of the month. They're always way low and they end up coming in higher. Until I see that, I don't know what it is. I would caution against being too aggressive for the fourth quarter because I mentioned the Delta variant. It's obviously not good news for the United States, nor for the rest of the world. But from what we've seen thus far, it's not crippling at all. Yeah. The -- look, I think overall the aftermarket, not only for HEICO but for the industry is obviously, you got to look at 20-something thousand aircraft out there. And by definition, most of those -- the ones that were parked-were basically in need of maintenance. They didn't park the ones that didn't need maintenance.  So yes, as demand gets added back, they've got to put money into the fleet. So, I think that is one of the situations that we've seen. However, we do ultimately anticipate a restocking and ultimately, of course, the rest of the world returning to normal. My sense is it's going to be pretty -- those attributes are going to be present over the next year, as well. It's hard to -- for me to present what those numbers are because they're occurring in many different areas. And it's difficult to see in the numbers. I mean, yes, we know what we're doing in terms of new products. But also, you got to combine that with the recovery in other markets, you got to look at how additional share gain is going to impact this, going forward. So, it becomes very difficult to identify, to call out. Thank you. Good morning. It's a nice-sized Company. I mean, they've got about 200 people. They are in the manufacturing business and they're really a very outstanding Company. We're really honored to be the home that they've selected for this business. And we think that there were a lot of people who would have coveted buying the Company. And they saw the culture that HEICO has got. And really our long-term commitment and the fact that we don't sell companies and that we just build and grow them.  They're going to be embarking on additional growth in terms of more buildings, more equipment. We're very excited about that. We've spoken with major customers and they're extremely well valued. And really the furthest ahead in that space, according to our customers. And so, we're really very, very optimistic that it's going to provide another great avenue for growth. Just good business with really great people.  We're very optimistic and it's again a nice adjacent wide space for us. We never did machining or bracing like this, frankly, I'd never seen this elsewhere. What they've been able to pioneer and develop, it started out as a very small Company. And due to the grit and determination of the founders and leaders in the business and all the people, they've been able to do stuff that other people viewed as really impossible.  And frankly, I've barely -- I've seen quite a bit of machining in my 31 years at HEICO, and I've never seen anything like Ridge. The machining and the brazing that they do is really very, very close tolerance, very difficult to do. And I don't think anybody else in the world can really do these kinds of products.  So, I think it's just a very good opportunity for us, and it's one of the reasons I'm very optimistic about our specialty products business, that we're going to see continued demand as the cycle builds over on the commercial side. And then with these products and some of the other stuff we're doing on the military side while I'm -- why I'm very optimistic on it."

Well, thank you and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us. We welcome you to the HEICO second quarter fiscal \u201821 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before beginning my review of the operating results, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO\u2019s talented team members for their loyalty and high performance during the continuing challenges brought on by COVID-19. The dedication to HEICO\u2019s customers and to the safety of their fellow team members has been commendable. And I want to thank every member of HEICO\u2019s worldwide team to be proud of what we accomplished during these unusual circumstances and to recognize that our future is very bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period, a stronger and more competitive company. I would now like to take a few moments to address the impact of COVID-19 on HEICO\u2019s recent operating results. Results of operation in the first 6 months and the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 continued to reflect the adverse impact from COVID-19. Most notably, demand for our commercial aviation products and services, continues to be moderated by the ongoing depressed commercial aerospace market, which we know is beginning to rebound and return to normal. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201821, we are cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will have and in fact is having a positive influence on commercial air travel and will generate more favorable economic environments in the markets that we serve. Summarizing the highlights of the first 6 months in second quarter of fiscal \u201821, we are pleased to report record quarterly net sales within the ETG Group and our third consecutive sequential increase in quarterly net sales and operating income of the Flight Support Group. The ETG Group set a quarterly net sales and operating income record in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821, improving 11% and 9% respectively. These increases principally reflect the impact from our profitable fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as very strong organic growth of 19% for our other electronic products. The Flight Support Group reported sequential growth in operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821. And they improved 37% and 16% respectively as compared to the first quarter of fiscal \u201821. Our total debt to shareholders\u2019 equity reduced and improved to 27.1% as of April 30, \u201821 and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, \u201820. Our net debt, which is total debt, less cash and cash equivalents of $199 million as of April 30, \u201821 compared to shareholders\u2019 equity ratio improved to 9.2% as of April 30, \u201821 and that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, \u201820. And this provides HEICO with substantial acquisition capital in the balance of our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as well as other available capital. We are not a capital constrained company. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.47x as of April 30, \u201821, down from 0.71x as of October 31, \u201820. During fiscal \u201821, we successfully completed one acquisition and we completed \u2013 we have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal \u201824 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes, which will accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities remain strong, increasing 2% to $210.1 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $205.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. In March \u201821, we acquired all of the business assets and certain liabilities of Pyramid Semiconductor. Pyramid is a specialty semiconductor designer and manufacturer, which offers a well-developed line of processors, static random access memory; electronically erasable, programmable, read-only memory and logic products on a diverse array of military, space and medical platforms. We do expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following the closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales were $429.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $553 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales were $230.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $252 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The net sales decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income was $61.3 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $109.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating income decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower net sales as well as a lower gross profit margin, higher performance-based compensation expense, and the impact from lost fixed cost efficiencies stemming from the pandemic. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income was $35.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $47.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating income decrease in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense, directly resulting from the strong improvement in operations during the past three consecutive quarters. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin was 14.3% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 19.8% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned higher performance based compensation expense and lost fixed cost efficiencies and the lower gross profit margin. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin was 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 18.9% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher performance based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales increased 9% to a record $466.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $427.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The net sales increase in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 1%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for other electronic and space products, partially offset by demand for commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales increased 11% to a record $243.1 million in fiscal second quarter of \u201821, up from $219 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The net sales increase in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally resulted from our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 3%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for our other electronic and defense products partially offset by decreased demand for commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income increased 7% to a record $131.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $123 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating income increase in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from lower net sales of defense and commercial aerospace products that were partially offset by an increase in net sales of certain other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income increased 9% to $71.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $65.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating income increase in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from a less favorable product mix for our defense products as well as a decrease in net sales of commercial aerospace products that were partially offset by a net increase in sales of certain other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 28.2% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 28.8% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 29.3% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 29.9% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth. I would turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLarry Mendelson: Thank you, Victor and Eric. Moving on to details, the diluted earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share was $1.03 in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $1.44 in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support and higher income tax expense and that was partially offset by the previously mentioned higher operating income of the ETG group and lower interest expense. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $0.51 in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $0.55 in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in second quarter fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support partially offset by lower income tax expense as well as higher operating income of the ETG Group and lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 that was up from $21.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820 and totaled $45.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $43.3 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the second quarter and first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects incremental impact from the fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions. R&D expense increased to $34.2 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $33.9 million, or 3.5% of net sales in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. R&D expense increased to $18 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $16.8 million, or 3.6% of net sales second quarter of fiscal \u201820. We know that significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. Our consolidated SG&A expense were $161.2 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $157.8 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $83 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $70.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense and the impact from our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions partially offset by reductions in other G&A expenses and selling expenses. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% in the first 6 months of \u201821, up from 16.2% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to $17.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from 15.1% in the second quarter of \u201820. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense. Interest expense decreased to $4.5 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, down from $8 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Interest expense decreased to $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was down from $3.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 was principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first 6 months and second quarter was not significant. Talking about income taxes. Our effective rate in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 was 12% as compared to 0.3% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 and \u201820. And that accounted for the majority of the decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate. The tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods was the result of strong appreciation in HEICO\u2019s stock price during the option-ease holding period and the larger benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal \u201820 was the result of more stock options exercised in that period. Our effective tax rate decreased to 19.5% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was down from 22.6% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $11.5 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $13.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group, in which non-controlling interests are held and that was partially offset by higher allocations of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain fiscal \u201820 acquisitions as well as an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the ETG Group, in which non-controlling interests are held. Net income to non-controlling interest was $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. For the full fiscal \u201821 year, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate of between 24% and 26% of pre-tax income. Now, let\u2019s talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. One thing I want to mention that in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821, cash flow from operations was 146% of reported net income. So, the net income was $70.7 million and the cash flow was almost $103 million. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain very strong. As we discussed earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities increased 2% to $210.1 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up slightly from $205.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Our working capital ratio was 4.5 to 1 as of April 30 compared to 4.8 as of October 31, \u201821. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 41 days as of April 30, \u201821, that was down slightly from 44 days as of April 30, \u201820. We continue to closely monitor receivable collection in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top five customers represented approximately 23% and 24% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and \u201820 respectively. Inventory turnover rate was 153 days for the period ending April 30, \u201821 compared to 139 days for the period ended April 30, \u201820. The increased turnover rate principally reflects lower sales volume from the pandemic\u2019s impact on demand for certain of our commercial aerospace products and services. Despite the increased turnover rate, our subsidiaries have done an excellent job controlling inventory levels in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and we believe that\u2019s appropriate to support expected future net sales as well as our increased backlog as of April 30, \u201821 which increased by $51 million to $895 million. Looking ahead, as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201821, we are cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will have a positive influence, and in fact, is having a positive influence on commercial air travel. And it will generate favorable economic environments in the markets that we serve. The pace of recovery in the global travel remains difficult to predict and can be negatively influenced by new COVID variants and varying vaccine adoption rates. Given those uncertainties, we cannot provide fiscal \u201821 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. We continue to estimate capital expenditures of approximately $40 million for fiscal \u201821. We believe that our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity, low debt enables us \u2013 and a degree of liquidity enables us to invest in new R&D development, enables us to execute on a successful acquisition program and positions HEICO for market share gains as the industry recovers. Again, in closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. During these professionally and personally challenging times, that strength will manifest from the culture of ownership, mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding our customers\u2019 expectations. We thank you all for everything you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I want to remind the listeners that a very high percentage of HEICO team members are HEICO shareowners through their 401(k) plans. We have many millionaires, multimillionaires and wealthy team members who all support the operation of HEICO. That\u2019s the extent of my planned remarks. And I would like to open the floor for any questions. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning everybody.\nLarry Mendelson: Good morning, Robert.\nRobert Spingarn: I have a few different questions really across for all of you, but I am going to start with Victor and the organic growth in the quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the markets where you did see positive growth and if you could size for us or quantify perhaps the negative growth in commercial?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, Rob, thank you. This is good questions. On \u2013 in the quarter, our strongest growth came out of our, what I would call, other electronic markets. And I think we saw strong rebound there certainly year-over-year and continuing sequentially there and that\u2019s in line with what we expected. And that was number one for us followed by medical was our second strongest and probably for obvious reasons, right, a year ago things were shutting down really in both of those markets going the wrong way. Then third strongest was defense for us in terms of growth. And then in space, commercial space, we gave up a little bit of ground, but that\u2019s really a result of two things. One, I think tough comps, but also we had some things shifting out of more of the latter shifting out of the quarter into later part of the year and just delivery schedules that we\u2019re expecting in the later part of the year. So I would say space for us commercial space should be decent overall on the year. And then commercial aviation was really the weakest for us. And that\u2019s down in the neighborhood of kind of what you would expect the kind of comparable to what we\u2019re seeing in Flight Support Group. And so \u2013 and no surprise for us there.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just on your margins. You mentioned earlier, there is a little bit of gross margin pressure. I assume that\u2019s the volume shortfalls in the end markets you just cited. But at the same time, you\u2019re not far off your high margins. You\u2019re in the low \u2013 in that 31% neighborhood. How might we think about margins once volumes recover in commercial? Or is it spread some across the other business lines that doesn\u2019t rally \u2013 it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter how much commercial comes back?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, commercial is important to us, and that\u2019s a good margin business for us. So I think that will help us. But it is broadly spread across. And as you\u2019ve heard me say before, it is also mix sensitive. And so where some of our higher-margin defense products wind up selling will influence that in the future. So I \u2013 my guess is, as I\u2019ve said before it\u2019s very difficult for me to get too worked up on our guys on the margins if they are in what I call very high territory. And so if it\u2019s \u2013 if they are 50 basis points, 100 basis points, even a couple of hundred basis points, frankly, within what we have experienced historically, they are within that range that I\u2019m generally pretty happy. And so \u2013 but I think commercial aviation will be a benefit to us. And the question is, what gets offset in higher-margin defense.\nCarlos Macau: One thing to keep in mind, Rob, is that, for what it\u2019s worth, the way I think about ETG margins is on normal years, not focusing on quarters We should run anywhere from 20% to 30% on GAAP margin. That is what I would expect as a business. To Victor\u2019s point, it\u2019s going to flux up down all over the place on a quarterly basis. But it\u2019s a healthy segment. Good mix of companies. And when commercial comes back, we had a fall in that sweet spot relatively consistently. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay, alright. Thanks for that, Carlos. Eric, just switching over to FSG question that we all ask, I think, each quarter is how the quarter trended month by month? How things are shaping up in May? And then if you could speak to your expectations how airlines and customers will behave ahead of strong summer, at least domestic summer travel season? Will they want the parts beforehand? Will they want the parts after? How do we think about that?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Rob, those are really good questions. As you can imagine, the quarter trended up as we went along in the quarter. And with the U.S. carriers, adding back capacity, we would anticipate that it will continue to trend up. Of course, Europe is very slow. Asia is a little bit mixed right now. But we\u2019d anticipate as the airlines start operating more aircraft, they are going to need more parts. So I would say that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s expected right now. Of course, in the new build area, our specialty products area, that is still \u2013 that hasn\u2019t seen as much of a recovery. It is recovering. But of course, the new build is definitely more challenged and will take a little bit longer to respond than the aftermarket did.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just a final question Larry for you, you talked about M&A earlier in the transactions that you\u2019ve done. How do things look today in the pipeline and to what extent is the potential capital gains tax increase influencing sellers?\nLarry Mendelson: I mean I thought there would be a bigger impact. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t really see that. I think the number of opportunities is kind of normal. The ability to do the due diligence is getting a little bit better because we\u2019re able to access these places. But I would say things look about normal. I don\u2019t see any people running out. I think from what people tell me, a lot of people are discounting the 40% Biden threat for capital gain, and they are talking more about 25% or 28%. And at those rates, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a panic at this point. I think with Congress pretty close that Biden, my personal opinion is that I don\u2019t think he is going to get 40%, and I am not even sure if he is going to get 25% or 28%, he might. But there\u2019ll be a lot of pushback. So at this point, I would say, Rob, it\u2019s pretty normal. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you everyone.\nLarry Mendelson: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\nEric Ruden: Hi, good morning. You actually have Eric Ruden on the line for Peter today. Maybe if I could just following-up on the order environment at FSG, Eric. In terms of airline inventory levels, last quarter, we were talking about inventory destocking having ended, and you guys were pretty vocal in predicting that. And you mentioned schedules expand, you expect more parts with that. Maybe you could just comment, is that in terms of thinking about restocking, are you seeing any of that yet? Or is it still kind of just-in-time type order activity?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, Eric. Good morning and thanks for your question. Yes, I think we called that correctly, and we were the first ones to call the end destocking when we did in December. And then, of course, in our last quarterly call in February. Right now, what we see is obviously accelerated sales. I mean, you can see the 16% increase Q1 to Q2, a consecutive increase. So obviously, the airlines are buying more. Our sense is that most of that is being used. Yes, some is \u2013 some inevitably will end up on the shelf. But we haven\u2019t seen what I would call the serious restocking yet. My guess is that they have got to get all the aircraft back into service. And then maybe the restocking starts at that point. Once the aircraft, the more intense restocking would start once the more, once a greater percentage of the fleet gets put into service. Also, if you look at the European numbers, the airlines are really suffering over there. And the \u2013 obviously, I don\u2019t think that they are restocking at this point. And that will come later in the cycle. So my guess is we start to see some restocking more in HEICO\u2019s fiscal 2022 area. Maybe there is a little bit of it in our fourth quarter, but it\u2019s hard to say at the moment. But we did correctly predict the end of the destocking. And I think that due to our relationships with our customers, we\u2019re going to be right there and understand when the airlines start to restock. I mean I have had conversations with airline executives, and I can tell you that they are very much focused. The airline \u2013 and I\u2019m talking executives in major airlines, they are very much focused on making sure that they can complete the fights that they have got planned. And this is definitely a topic for the operations people and all the airlines. They are very much looking at this to make sure they have got the parts on the shelf.\nEric Ruden: Okay, thank you. And maybe that\u2019s a good segue into my next question on just trying to frame up kind of how you guys are seeing market share gains at FSG. If I look at FSG and kind of just the revenue share of total flight activity coming out of previous downturn, HEICO has been able to increase that metric pretty significantly after the \u201802 and \u201808 recessions. And if I look through COVID so far, there is been a pretty dramatic increase already, which appears to be a bit ahead of schedule as previous downturns, we would expect to see that as we get into the actual recovery, which still obviously has a long way to go so far. So I guess my question would be, are you seeing increased content with your customers already, given that the inventory destock has ended and are now placing orders? And maybe you could just provide general update on the conversations, I know you have with your sales team?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. The answer is yes. I think that HEICO is picking up market share. We see it as we look into the \u2013 we\u2019ve got very good visibility into the various products on which we are \u2013 which we supply parts for. And we would anticipate that, that will continue to pick up. The \u2013 when you look at the different areas of our business, whether it\u2019s parts or repair or distribution, I think we\u2019ve got very good content in those areas. And we will continue to go ahead and pick up there. With regard to how this time is different from the other times, this time was so precipitous that we would anticipate that they would bounce back quicker because they just \u2013 as we said on the December call, they just couldn\u2019t continue to operate at the levels at which they were operating in the December area. I do think that the market share gain is going to be more pronounced for HEICO as compared to other suppliers because of the value that we generate. We were very good to our customers through this whole pandemic. We are very good to our team members. I think we\u2019re in a unique position to be able to respond and to take market share. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a market share shift, frankly, specifically towards HEICO as compared to other suppliers in the industry.\nEric Ruden: Okay, thanks. I appreciate your comments. I will leave it there.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLarry Solow: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Perhaps just a couple of follow-ups just on FSG, Eric, so you gave us some good color there, some good qualitative color. And certainly, you guys are continuing to rebound and, I think, down about 25% now, if you look relative to pre-pandemic and fiscal \u201819. Do you still think that you can get back without giving specifics, but get back to fiscal \u201819 levels sometime and fiscal \u201822 and perhaps even before the market or passenger demand fully recovers? And then, I guess, part two of that question is sort of the magnitude or the cadence of that recovery because it looks like this quarter was a pretty good sequential improvement. Do you expect that to continue? Or as we look out in the next few quarters or maybe slow down a little bit?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think those are good questions, Larry. Of course, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, and I don\u2019t know what the next number of quarters are going to be like. I mean, with the 16% growth that we saw in the second quarter, my sense is that, that quarter-over-quarter, that\u2019s a pretty hard number to beat. So I would I\u2019m very \u2013 HEICO, we\u2019re very cautious. And we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the parts on the shelf. We\u2019re not over levered. We want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the parts on the shelf so we can meet our customer demand. However, we want to be careful about getting over our skis. So I think 16% quarter-on-quarter improvement is very high. Who knows what it will be in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I would be surprised to see that kind of improvement. I think our 16% number has surprised and frankly, it surprised us. I think it\u2019s probably surprising most people on the call today. And I do think part of that is a market share shift and HEICO winning in the marketplace because of how we behave during the pandemic. If you look at what IATA came out with this morning, they are predicting global passenger numbers will recover to 52% of pre-COVID levels in 2021 and rising to 88% in 2022 and 105% in 2023. So my guess is that it\u2019s going to be until 2023 in order to meet the 2019 numbers. Remember, HEICO year-end is in October. So therefore, for us to report 2022, equaling 2019, is much harder than foremost for others who would have 2 better months, if you will, in there. So I think it\u2019s really more of a 2023 story. But I mean, this is something that we\u2019re watching very, very carefully. If you look, it\u2019s really leisure travel that is saving the industry right now. And business travel is in the tank at a fraction of where it used to be. And international travel is in the tank also. And the airlines really have a skeleton network up to be able to support the international destinations. So I know the Biden administration is looking at changing rules and getting rid of 212 F and setting up these corridors between the United States and other countries. And I think this is going to be very important for the United States to lead because the United States has always done very well with the aerospace and defense industry and exports, and we really got to get out there and lead. They have got to get these travel corridors opened. So the airlines can start doing well on the longer haul as well as on the business travel. So I think those are the two things that I would really watch out for. Yes, Europe will be back this summer. It\u2019s starting to come back. But again, that\u2019s not a leisure . That\u2019s not on business, and it\u2019s not on long haul. So we really need the governments around the world to address this, and we certainly advocate for a safe via policy, whereby you have to show either a positive \u2013 either a vaccination or negative COVID test, one or the other. But the U.S. has really got to get out front in this and lead the world.\nLarry Solow: Right. Okay. Great. I appreciate that was really good color. And then just a second question. Perhaps for you, maybe perhaps, Carlos can chime in, too. Just on the \u2013 you guys mentioned several times in the increase in incentive comp. And is this \u2013 clearly, it seems like it\u2019s a signal that, I guess, you expect business to at least continue to improve. But the level of incentive comp, was there some catch-up in there, I guess, both at the FSG level and at the corporate level in this quarter relative to the last few quarters and maybe will trend back more to a normalized level as we look out?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I think \u2013 Larry, this is Carlos. Relative to 2020, we didn\u2019t have any \u2013 in the second quarter last year, we actually had reversals of Q1 bonus, right? So we sort of didn\u2019t have good comp to 20 to go against. If you\u2019re \u2013 it sounds like your question is, are they more normalized or we\u2019re getting to something more normal? I would say that we\u2019re still below \u201819 levels on performance-based comp stuff. And I would expect that to be the case throughout \u201821. We\u2019re not going to get up to those levels of volume that we had in \u201819, I don\u2019t think this fiscal year, right? So we\u2019re not out of line. We\u2019re just in a situation. It\u2019s very unique this quarter, whereby we had in \u201820 some reversals, which amplify, if you would, the impact of the performance-based comp. But your thesis or your commentary about expecting the rest of the year to play out very nicely, yes, we expect that, and that is why we do have for a safe comp in the numbers this year.\nLarry Solow: Fair enough. I appreciate that. Thanks, Carlos.\nCarlos Macau: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Josh Sullivan from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nLarry Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: Just curious on the overall trends of PMA adoption and interest, are you seeing more demand out of the existing traditional PMA customers, when you talk about market share gains or is COVID inducted kind of any new or previously maybe underrepresented categories of customers for PMA parts?\nEric Mendelson: I would say it comes \u2013 Josh, this is Eric. I would say it comes from both. The bigger area, since we were already pretty much working with everybody, I think it would be more of increased penetration to everybody else, but there are other underrepresented. And I think that\u2019s a good term you\u2019re using to describe the opportunity, and we are seeing progress there as well.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at, just maybe as we see maybe more leasing ownership of the global fleet. Has their acceptance increased or just what is the viewpoint of the leasing customer base at this point?\nEric Mendelson: I think we\u2019re making progress in that area. There are a number of lessors who do use our parts. And I think that the tide is rising for us there. I mean this is not going to be an immediate switch. There are commercial reasons why some folks want to stay with OEM parts. But it is a substantial penalty to their customers. So we are making good progress in the area, and I think a lot more upside exists for us, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m optimistic on it.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one last one, just switching gears, what is your overall to semiconductor, semi-cap market at this point with Apex and Pyramid, just curious how you guys see yourself fitting into the overall just conversation around global semiconductor supply chains?\nVictor Mendelson: Josh, this is Victor. Generally, we are keeping our participation in semiconductor market. For the most part, in the high rail areas, defense and so on. Again, consistent with our view \u2013 HEICO\u2019s view of being in niches, in low production run markets, kind of the higher value-added as opposed to mass markets. And we have an appetite to grow in those. There are lengthening supply chains in those markets. And I think we should grow on those. We are adding both in market penetration, we believe, as well as new product development we\u2019re trying to expand there and look for more acquisitions. We \u2013 I don\u2019t see us being a participant, for example, in automotive. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely. Although I wouldn\u2019t rule it out if there were some very unique high-end applications. I see us participating in places like defense, like aviation, high end clean energy, power, wind power generation, things like that, which we\u2019ve done at Connect Tech for example, and are doing at Connect Tech electrification and rail and things of that nature would also be markets that we\u2019d continue to serve.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay, thank you. Appreciate the time.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nLarry Mendelson: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: I\u2019ve just got a couple for you. First of all, there is been some talk that Rolls-Royce might be close to a deal with IATA on sorting out its MRO chain and the fact that it could be a little bit not holistic at the moment. Does this present an opportunity for you to gain share on the Rolls-Royce fleet or is this not really aligned with what you\u2019re focused on?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, Rob, it\u2019s Eric. I\u2019d be happy to take that question. We\u2019ve read the same in the trade press about Rolls-Royce and IATA being close to a deal. As you know, Rolls-Royce had a fairly closed and smaller network than the other manufacturers. So it was never a focus for HEICO. So I don\u2019t think that this is something that\u2019s a major opportunity for us. But if a customer wants us to go in that area, we\u2019d be happy to talk to them. But I think Rolls due to the quantities of engines, the fact that they are wide-body engines and that in order to have them serviced, they would go into these various JV shops. I wouldn\u2019t see this as an area of focus for us.\nRobert Stallard: Yes. And then secondly, a lot of talk around obviously about inflation, I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen any signs of input cost pressure over the last quarter? And what\u2019s your ability to pass on any inflated costs up a line?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think with regard to \u2013 certainly, with regard to our aftermarket business, I think we\u2019ve got the opportunity to pass along the cost increases. If you look at the fact that we offer great value to our customers, I think that if our input costs went up, that we would have the ability to do that. I would fully anticipate that the OEM list prices will reflect this latest inflation pressure. And we\u2019re going to work very closely with our customers to explain if we\u2019ve got to push along some cost increases, why we have to do that. We\u2019re all very familiar with the labor challenges in the United States these days and even to get standard materials. It\u2019s challenging on the consumer side. As far as on the manufacturing side, I think outside of things that are directly consumer facing, there is been less of that, but it is something that we\u2019re keeping a very, very close eye on to make sure that we were able to adjust our prices. We feel very confident I can tell you that as individual shareholders in HEICO, in the event there is greater inflation, as a shareholder of HEICO, I feel very confident that HEICO will be able to make up any potential valuation problems as a result of inflation. We\u2019re going to be able to increase our prices and eliminate that risk, in my opinion, as a shareholder.\nRobert Stallard: Yes, that makes sense. Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is Ken Herbert from Canaccord.\nKen Herbert: Yes. Hi, good morning everybody.\nLarry Mendelson: Hi, Ken.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Hey, Eric, I just wanted to ask one final question on FSG, if I could. For you\u2019re up 16% sequentially, can you break that down at all or provide any color on how the respective businesses, repair distribution and replacement parts fit into that in terms of where you saw maybe more growth versus less growth?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I can. I would be happy to do that. We saw, as you would anticipate, the area that we were, of course, down the most as compared to last year, would have been the commercial aerospace \u2013 commercial aviation because of the pandemic. And if you look at defense, that wasn\u2019t down to the extent that the commercial was. When you dig a little bit deeper, specialty products, which is the OEM supply, which is more predominantly OEM supply, that was down in the largest area with the parts and distribution and the component repair, not down nearly as much as the specialty products. But we do anticipate that with Airbus and Boeing increasing their build rates that specialty products will be coming behind \u2013 coming from behind very shortly here.\nKen Herbert: Okay. So it\u2019s fair to say then that your pure aerospace aftermarket businesses, distribution repair and the replacement parts within FSG were up greater than the 16% sequentially you saw for the segment in the quarter?\nEric Mendelson: I would think so. I don\u2019t have the numbers here in front of me to validate that. But I believe that would be the case here. Carlos can...\nCarlos Macau: That\u2019s correct. Ken, the \u2013 if you look at this three lines of business that Eric just laid out, the organic shrink, if you would, was in the mid-single digits on parts and repair and component repair. So they are coming back to Eric\u2019s point specialty products was not as robust and was a bigger drag on the segment. So I think with that information, you should be able to back into the numbers you\u2019re looking for.\nKen Herbert: Perfect. Thanks, Carlos. And if I could, maybe Victor or Larry, a number of your recent acquisitions have, of course, been on the defense side. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing now moving forward in terms of multiples? And are you maybe being a little bit more patient on the defense market because you think multiples could get a little bit more attractive as we move further into this budget cycle?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. So, this is Victor. We have been very careful really all along on the multiples that we would pay on defense thinking \u2013 and you have heard us say this, that the defense budgets don\u2019t grow to the sky. And that though it\u2019s an excellent place to live and that there is a strong need in defense, and we could do very well in defense that we needed to be careful for just that reason. So, we have been cautious. I can tell you that we have turned away a lot of potential acquisitions, particularly over the last year, 9 months, when there were no commercial aviation deals, of course, and all the A&D, right, aerospace and defense, was going to D, right, defense, because all the \u2013 there was a feeding frenzy. If you wanted to participate in the sector, there was only one place you could buy. So, all the money was funneled into that. And we set out a lot of potential acquisitions. So, I would think things will stabilize in some of the opportunities we decided that we would pass on other kinds of opportunities we passed on overvaluation might become opportunities, again, not the very same companies, but the types of companies. And we are extremely selective. I think there are great companies and great opportunities, but as always, we have to be careful. And for whatever its worth, we look at probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 acquisitions for every one that we make, probably north of that now. And that\u2019s always probably going to be the case. Selectivity is really key. We don\u2019t want to just rush out and buy anything.\nKen Herbert: Great. Thanks for the detail Victor.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning everybody.\nLarry Mendelson: Good morning Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Just trying to pull apart the FSG margins, the sequential incremental is about 30%. The decremental, if I look at a 2-year change, so going back to 2Q \u201819 is about 30%. I think the business has something in the 30% on the incremental-decremental pretty consistently. But the year-over-year is much higher it\u2019s a 55% decremental. And then also, I think if I strip out the abnormal expenses you had in the back half of last year, you were maybe already near the 15%ish that you had in the quarter. So, is all of that explained by the incentive comp that you have discussed here not taking place last year and now that\u2019s coming back or is there some other way to square the circle on those changes in the FSG margin?\nCarlos Macau: No, this is Carlos. It is completely explained by the performance-based comp.\nNoah Poponak: Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then, Eric, within the FSG revenue change, you have mentioned share gain a few times here, and you spoke to being positively surprised by the rate of sequential increase and attributing that to share gain. Could you maybe give us some specific examples of where you are already picking up share here in the early parts of recovery, just so we can better understand that?\nEric Mendelson: I would say, in particular, it would be over in the PMA area. And as I talk with our sales folks and customers and understand what they want us to focus on. It\u2019s in basically what we have always called the adjacent white spaces as we broadened our product line, picking up products, which customers hadn\u2019t typically worked with us on in the past, and that\u2019s really the area where I would say I am most optimistic on that front.\nNoah Poponak: Can you tell us what some of those are?\nEric Mendelson: I would rather not because we don\u2019t \u2013 we try not to speak about particular customers or product types due to competitive reasons. We do have a number of our competitors on the call this morning, and I welcome them, but I would rather not give them a road map on where we are going.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. Fair enough. Okay. And then just last one quickly, Carlos, just on the free cash. Your \u2013 in most normal years, your free cash is stronger in the back half than the first half. And even last year with a pandemic, it was about even. And this year, you are recovering through the year. So, should we expect your free cash flow to be higher in the second half than the first half of your fiscal \u201821?\nCarlos Macau: I expect that. However, I have to be careful that as volumes increase we are going to have to build working capital, we are going to have to replenish, things like receivables and inventories will grow up a little bit. But I do expect we will have stronger free cash flow in the latter half of \u201821.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thanks very much.\nCarlos Macau: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one would be from Sheila from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Eric, I want to talk more about share gains, if that\u2019s okay. Maybe can you tell us on share gains, where are you gaining share from? Is it other PMA manufacturers? Is it versus USM? Is it the OEM? And then what makes an airline choose a used serviceable part versus a PMA? And does it differ with lessors or just airlines as operators?\nEric Mendelson: So, good morning Sheila, with regard to the share gains, I think it\u2019s against other PMA companies as well as other OEMs. So, it\u2019s both. With regard to USM, less than 10% of our sales are parts in excess of $5,000 over on the PMA side. So, we don\u2019t believe that we are exposed to the USM market. So therefore, it\u2019s not a major item for us. If there is used serviceable out there, I think it makes financial sense. It ultimately will get sold and will get used. But it\u2019s not really a big area of focus for us. We do have a subsidiary that does very well in the USM market primary, and provides us a glimpse into what\u2019s going on in that space. So, we are very knowledgeable about it. But \u2013 and for those reasons, we don\u2019t believe that there is much of an impact on our other businesses.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. And then maybe can you talk about you gave color on the commercial aero business declining more specialty OE expected to pick up as production rates change. But can you talk a little bit about where \u2013 what you are seeing within the commercial aero market? And how you expect that to recover, whether it\u2019s engine parts? I know engine is much less of a focus than it was a decade ago. Aero frame interiors, wherever you guys play in terms of how you expect that sort of recovery to pick up?\nEric Mendelson: So, the engine market has been more delayed than the non-engine market. I would say that it fell more precipitously. And it\u2019s also coming back a little slower as airlines focus on preserving cash, but that will go ahead and come back. A majority of our PMA business is in the non-engine market. We still do have engine parts exposure. And it\u2019s still an important part of the business for us. But as we have said historically, most of our business is in the non-engine side.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then last one for either you or Victor or Carlos too, following up on Bob\u2019s question, we have been getting this a lot as, obviously, inflation is apparent. What you maybe what \u2013 can you define your split of labor versus commodities for \u2013 within your COGS? And how do we think about 1 or 2 of your major commodity costs?\nCarlos Macau: So Sheila, this is Carlos. The products that HEICO make, a lot of the input costs, frankly, is IP, it\u2019s a lot of engineering, a lot of R&D. The actual material costs, and this is pretty consistent within both segments. The actual material cost is lower. So, I am less concerned about inflation on raw materials. And to Eric\u2019s point earlier in the conversation, I do believe that the OEMs who we use, as you know, the pricing umbrella to set our pricing, they will capture that, and we will follow them up if there is something to be gained there. I think on the labor side, that\u2019s where we could feel a little bit more. And as we grow and as we expand and hire more skilled labor and things like that, I do think that, that could have a little bit of an impact. But I don\u2019t think we are going to be impacted any more adversely than any other corporation out there. I think that the type of workers that we are hiring and the types of labor inflation seen across the country and even really globally, there is nothing unique about HEICO that would cause us to be different than other folks.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. Thank you, guys very much for this conference.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Louis Raffetto from UBS. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Thank you. Good morning. Actually, just a follow-up on that. So Eric, I think you guys cut like 25% of your headcount last year in FSG. Are you hiring them back now as these volumes return or do you see yourself being I guess, leaner going forward?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I am not sure \u2013 I don\u2019t think we cut 25% of the headcount. What we did was we had limited layoffs and we also had furloughs, some of which were voluntary. And then for those who remained on the aftermarket space, we all took voluntary pay cuts. But HEICO retained a much larger percentage of our workforce than our peers in the commercial aviation space. So, we are in a very good position right now where we are able to generate our new product development. I mean there are a lot of other companies that gutted their new product development effort, HEICO did not do that. We have retained our skills. So, I think that we are in a very good and unique position to be able to gain market share and satisfy our customers going forward.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. I will circle up with Carlos on the numbers from the 10-K, I guess. So I guess, Victor, for you, I think the budget comes out later this week. Any specific areas that you are looking at in that or that we should be thinking about it? I know you mentioned earlier about some of the higher margin defense things. I know JDAM is something that has been particularly big for the ACT acquisition. So, just trying to get a sense as to what you are looking at that?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. I think at this point, Louis, we ought to wait and see. It\u2019s Friday when they are going to put the budget out, and we will see exactly what it looks like. I mean there is a rule of thumb, as you know, we have tried to bias the business very heavily toward intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, standoff warfare, the higher technology segments of the defense budget, and we tried to live less in the operations tempo, although we are not entirely outside of that. And generally speaking, we believe that\u2019s where the expenditures over time would be more heavily weighted. And so that should benefit us relative to others. But I think we have to wait and just see where it comes out. And of course, Friday will be the first shot and then there will be the negotiations and they will go through the committees and so on, and it will take some time to shake out from there. But we will at least have a sense of priorities. And of course, things like missile defense remain important, and that\u2019s a good part of what we do, both in ETG and the Flight Support Group within HEICO. So, I think we will continue to do that.\nEric Mendelson: By the way, Louis, this is Eric. In looking at some of our numbers, the larger layoffs did occur in our specialty products area, which are non-aftermarket facing businesses. So \u2013 and predominantly, most of the reduction was done in a particular facility in Asia due to just the lack of work. So, we feel very confident that we are going to be able to spool up that \u2013 those processes, those businesses have very well-defined processes and labor content, manufacturing processes. So, we feel that we are going to be in a very good position to be able to spool up. In the aftermarket space, our layoffs weren\u2019t anywhere near the number that you said. I think you may be referring to other companies that were in the aftermarket who cut their employment to those levels, but HEICO never did. And the Asia reduction, actually, some of that was government-mandated because there was ordered shutdown.\nVictor Mendelson: Exactly.\nEric Mendelson: And some of those\u2026\nVictor Mendelson: That\u2019s another good point, Louis.\nCarlos Macau: I mean one thing, Louis, you maybe remember, we did take a 20% pay cut. The executives did since last year. Maybe that\u2019s what you are remembering when you are thinking about those layoff numbers that you quoted earlier.\nLouis Raffetto: Yes, I am just looking at the reported headcounts from the 10-Ks. So, I mean just the employee numbers basically from 10-K to 10-K. But yes, we can follow-up offline to go over that again, maybe it\u2019s the furloughs or something like that is kind of reported in the employee headcount numbers. So I guess, just one more to follow-up here. I guess, guidance, still no guidance that give FSG, but I am not sure I get for ETG. Do you guys just not want to give sort of piecemeal guidance or you just don\u2019t give anything or is there something else within ETG that you don\u2019t feel like you have really good visibility on?\nCarlos Macau: Well, in the ETG, for example, commercial aerospace can make up anywhere from 10% to 15% of that segment\u2019s run rate. And so there is \u2013 it isn\u2019t as clear as we would like it to be right now. And the truth of the matter is, I would rather not give piecemeal guidance. We are typically only giving guidance on an annual basis. And I don\u2019t want to get into a game where we are giving segment guidance for one and not for the other. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful. It may cause confusion. So, we would rather ride this out. And hopefully, the company will continue to outperform folks\u2019 expectations. But nonetheless, the visibility right now for guidance is not such that I wanted to give at this time.\nEric Mendelson: And frankly, Louis, this is Eric. Our 16% increase in Flight Support was so far beyond what we or anybody else thought was possible or doable. And I really give tremendous credit to our team members for accomplishing that. Had we given guidance 3 months ago, we would have missed it, and everybody would have said that we sandbagged it when, in fact, things just got much better, much quicker. So, I just don\u2019t think we are in a position right now to give guidance. It wouldn\u2019t be the responsible thing to do.\nLarry Mendelson: Louis, this is Larry. I want to add my two sense to Eric and Carlos. I completely agree with that policy. Remember, please, that HEICO is one company. It\u2019s not 2 companies. It\u2019s not an ETG company and a Flight Support company. And when we talk about the results of HEICO, it\u2019s a combined operation. So, to give guidance in 1 division and not the other would be, in my opinion, totally improper, and it\u2019s not something that we are going to do.\nLouis Raffetto: Fair enough. Thank you.\nLarry Mendelson: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Scott on for Gautam.\nLarry Mendelson: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just one for me. Just given your comments on the active defense market last year, are you seeing any difference in any end markets this year for M&A? And are you seeing more opportunities in commercial versus defense or is that still pretty limited?\nVictor Mendelson: I think that \u2013 this is Victor. I think we are still seeing much heavier bias on defense. We are seeing some commercial start to awaken, which is really consistent with what we expected. I think people are feeling a little more comfortable about making some projections about where they might be and asking for pricing based upon a reasonable recovery in \u2013 at least privately. But for the most part, it remains heavily weighted towards defense or defense and space and other markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: You are welcome.\nOperator: We have our next question from Colin Ducharme from Sterling Capital. Please go ahead.\nColin Ducharme: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just maybe just 2 quick ones for Carlos \u2013 aim best at Carlos here. The revolver pay down, you guys opportunistically expanded that a couple of quarters ago. Anything to read there? Any significance, if you could just help characterize that for us? And then perhaps I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s got a connected frame to just kind of the M&A pipe. Larry characterized that as somewhat normal, but anything you can give us top of funnel there, perhaps LOI signed in terms of trends, just interested there? And then finally, on incremental kind of free cash flow margins going forward, Carlos, if you could just talk about the facility footprint perhaps, I know you had talked about some required CapEx to upgrade some equipment in prior quarters. Where does that stand as we continue to recover here? Do you anticipate anything out of the ordinary from a CapEx standpoint, just kind of characterizing where you are \u2013 where your footprint kind of stands today? Thank you.\nLarry Mendelson: This is Larry. Let me handle the M&A question. We never speculate on LOIs or anything like that because even if we were to sign an LOI, it would be slightly misleading because there is a lot of due diligence that goes into it. And we signed confidentiality agreements all the time. We do due diligence, and we discover that it\u2019s not for us. So, I would never want to mislead the public and make them think, oh, we had this thing. But I think our comment that the pipeline is what we would call normal. We are looking at a number of transactions, and we can never predict which ones are really going to close. I mean we had some to be honest with you right now that looked very good at the beginning and as we get into them they look a little varied. So, those may if I had this conversation with you 2 months ago, I would say all this looks very good, we think we are going to close very soon and that would have been this weekend. So, it\u2019s still very close or may not, but I don\u2019t want to lead anybody in the wrong direction. Carlos?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, Colin, I would just say that as we grow our appetite for acquisitions continues to expand. And that\u2019s really why we expanded the credit agreement last year to make sure that we have plenty of dry powder available to accommodate the growth expectations that we have as a management team. The pay down on the credit facility, we generated a ton of cash last quarter. And besides banking some of the balance sheet, we paid down the debt. We are not borrowing at a very high rate. I think my average rate is around 1.2% on our debt. So, it\u2019s a very low carry. And so we will keep paying it down, but it\u2019s a very efficient source of capital for us and very flexible. The question you had about the CapEx, we continue to expect around $40 million worth of CapEx this year. The first half of \u201821, we did have a fair amount of expansion capital. We spent about $22 million through the first 6 months of this year, and a good chunk of that was expansion capital to grow our footprint, if you would, in some of our key businesses. So, that\u2019s all a good thing. That\u2019s growth capital, right? And then the rest was maintenance, maybe 60-40 split or something like that on the spend. And I would expect, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I do think that our free cash flow generation in the second half of our fiscal year tends to be \u2013 it\u2019s historically been a little stronger, I would expect that pattern to continue. Absent any other resurgence or logistic issues associated with getting out of this pandemic. Does that answer your question, Colin?\nColin Ducharme: Yes. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful color. I appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. We don\u2019t have any further questions at this time. Presenters, please continue.\nLarry Mendelson: This is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank everybody on the call for your interest and your input. We look forward to improving conditions. We believe there will be improving conditions in the second half of our fiscal year and running into \u201822, barring any resumption of COVID issues or other kinds of problems. But we look forward to speaking to you at the third quarter call, which should be sometime towards the middle \u2013end of August. And in the meantime, if anybody has any question or comments, please call us. We are all available, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself, and we will be happy to speak with you and try to respond to your questions. So again, thank you all very much. And this is the end of our Q2 conference call.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "One thing to keep in mind, Rob, is that, for what it's worth, the way I think about ETG margins is on normal years, not focusing on quarters We should run anywhere from 20% to 30% on GAAP margin. That is what I would expect as a business. To Victor's point, it's going to flux up down all over the place on a quarterly basis. But it's a healthy segment. Good mix of companies. And when commercial comes back, we had a fall in that sweet spot relatively consistently. Well, I think \u2013 Larry, this is Carlos. Relative to 2020, we didn't have any \u2013 in the second quarter last year, we actually had reversals of Q1 bonus, right? So we sort of didn't have good comp to 20 to go against. If you're \u2013 it sounds like your question is, are they more normalized or we're getting to something more normal? I would say that we're still below \u201819 levels on performance-based comp stuff. And I would expect that to be the case throughout \u201821. We're not going to get up to those levels of volume that we had in \u201819, I don't think this fiscal year, right? So we're not out of line. We're just in a situation. It's very unique this quarter, whereby we had in \u201820 some reversals, which amplify, if you would, the impact of the performance-based comp. But your thesis or your commentary about expecting the rest of the year to play out very nicely, yes, we expect that, and that is why we do have for a safe comp in the numbers this year. Sure. That's correct. Ken, the \u2013 if you look at this three lines of business that Eric just laid out, the organic shrink, if you would, was in the mid-single digits on parts and repair and component repair. So they are coming back to Eric's point specialty products was not as robust and was a bigger drag on the segment. So I think with that information, you should be able to back into the numbers you're looking for. No, this is Carlos. It is completely explained by the performance-based comp. I expect that. However, I have to be careful that as volumes increase we are going to have to build working capital, we are going to have to replenish, things like receivables and inventories will grow up a little bit. But I do expect we will have stronger free cash flow in the latter half of \u201821. Sure. So Sheila, this is Carlos. The products that HEICO make, a lot of the input costs, frankly, is IP, it's a lot of engineering, a lot of R&D. The actual material costs, and this is pretty consistent within both segments. The actual material cost is lower. So, I am less concerned about inflation on raw materials. And to Eric's point earlier in the conversation, I do believe that the OEMs who we use, as you know, the pricing umbrella to set our pricing, they will capture that, and we will follow them up if there is something to be gained there.

I think that the type of workers that we are hiring and the types of labor inflation seen across the country and even really globally, there is nothing unique about HEICO that would cause us to be different than other folks. Sure. Thank you. I mean one thing, Louis, you maybe remember, we did take a 20% pay cut. The executives did since last year. Maybe that's what you are remembering when you are thinking about those layoff numbers that you quoted earlier. Well, in the ETG, for example, commercial aerospace can make up anywhere from 10% to 15% of that segment's run rate. And so there is \u2013 it isn't as clear as we would like it to be right now. And the truth of the matter is, I would rather not give piecemeal guidance. We are typically only giving guidance on an annual basis. And I don't want to get into a game where we are giving segment guidance for one and not for the other. I just don't think that's helpful. It may cause confusion. So, we would rather ride this out.

The pay down on the credit facility, we generated a ton of cash last quarter. And besides banking some of the balance sheet, we paid down the debt. We are not borrowing at a very high rate. I think my average rate is around 1.2% on our debt. So, it's a very low carry. And so we will keep paying it down, but it's a very efficient source of capital for us and very flexible. The question you had about the CapEx, we continue to expect around $40 million worth of CapEx this year. The first half of \u201821, we did have a fair amount of expansion capital. We spent about $22 million through the first 6 months of this year, and a good chunk of that was expansion capital to grow our footprint, if you would, in some of our key businesses. So, that's all a good thing. That's growth capital, right? And then the rest was maintenance, maybe 60-40 split or something like that on the spend. And I would expect, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I do think that our free cash flow generation in the second half of our fiscal year tends to be \u2013 it's historically been a little stronger, I would expect that pattern to continue. Absent any other resurgence or logistic issues associated with getting out of this pandemic. Does that answer your question, Colin? Okay."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 9% to a record $466.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $427.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The net sales increase in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 1%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for other electronic and space products, partially offset by demand for commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 11% to a record $243.1 million in fiscal second quarter of \u201821, up from $219 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The net sales increase in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally resulted from our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 3%. The organic growth principally reflects increased demand for our other electronic and defense products partially offset by decreased demand for commercial aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 7% to a record $131.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $123 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating income increase in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from lower net sales of defense and commercial aerospace products that were partially offset by an increase in net sales of certain other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 9% to $71.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $65.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating income increase in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by a lower gross profit margin, mainly from a less favorable product mix for our defense products as well as a decrease in net sales of commercial aerospace products that were partially offset by a net increase in sales of certain other electronic products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 28.2% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 28.8% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29.3% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 29.9% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth. I would turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes, Rob, thank you. This is good questions. On \u2013 in the quarter, our strongest growth came out of our, what I would call, other electronic markets. And I think we saw strong rebound there certainly year-over-year and continuing sequentially there and that's in line with what we expected. And that was number one for us followed by medical was our second strongest and probably for obvious reasons, right, a year ago things were shutting down really in both of those markets going the wrong way. Then third strongest was defense for us in terms of growth. And then in space, commercial space, we gave up a little bit of ground, but that's really a result of two things. One, I think tough comps, but also we had some things shifting out of more of the latter shifting out of the quarter into later part of the year and just delivery schedules that we're expecting in the later part of the year. So I would say space for us commercial space should be decent overall on the year. And then commercial aviation was really the weakest for us. And that's down in the neighborhood of kind of what you would expect the kind of comparable to what we're seeing in Flight Support Group. And so \u2013 and no surprise for us there. Well, commercial is important to us, and that's a good margin business for us. So I think that will help us. But it is broadly spread across. And as you've heard me say before, it is also mix sensitive. And so where some of our higher-margin defense products wind up selling will influence that in the future. So I \u2013 my guess is, as I've said before it's very difficult for me to get too worked up on our guys on the margins if they are in what I call very high territory. And so if it's \u2013 if they are 50 basis points, 100 basis points, even a couple of hundred basis points, frankly, within what we have experienced historically, they are within that range that I'm generally pretty happy. And so \u2013 but I think commercial aviation will be a benefit to us. And the question is, what gets offset in higher-margin defense. Josh, this is Victor. Generally, we are keeping our participation in semiconductor market. For the most part, in the high rail areas, defense and so on. Again, consistent with our view \u2013 HEICO's view of being in niches, in low production run markets, kind of the higher value-added as opposed to mass markets. And we have an appetite to grow in those. There are lengthening supply chains in those markets. And I think we should grow on those. We are adding both in market penetration, we believe, as well as new product development we're trying to expand there and look for more acquisitions. We \u2013 I don't see us being a participant, for example, in automotive. I don't think that's likely. Although I wouldn't rule it out if there were some very unique high-end applications. I see us participating in places like defense, like aviation, high end clean energy, power, wind power generation, things like that, which we've done at Connect Tech for example, and are doing at Connect Tech electrification and rail and things of that nature would also be markets that we'd continue to serve. Thank you. Yes. So, this is Victor. We have been very careful really all along on the multiples that we would pay on defense thinking \u2013 and you have heard us say this, that the defense budgets don't grow to the sky. And that though it's an excellent place to live and that there is a strong need in defense, and we could do very well in defense that we needed to be careful for just that reason. So, we have been cautious. I can tell you that we have turned away a lot of potential acquisitions, particularly over the last year, 9 months, when there were no commercial aviation deals, of course, and all the A&D, right, aerospace and defense, was going to D, right, defense, because all the \u2013 there was a feeding frenzy. If you wanted to participate in the sector, there was only one place you could buy. So, all the money was funneled into that. And we set out a lot of potential acquisitions. So, I would think things will stabilize in some of the opportunities we decided that we would pass on other kinds of opportunities we passed on overvaluation might become opportunities, again, not the very same companies, but the types of companies. And we are extremely selective. I think there are great companies and great opportunities, but as always, we have to be careful. And for whatever its worth, we look at probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 acquisitions for every one that we make, probably north of that now. And that's always probably going to be the case. Selectivity is really key. We don't want to just rush out and buy anything. Thank you. Yes. I think at this point, Louis, we ought to wait and see. It's Friday when they are going to put the budget out, and we will see exactly what it looks like. I mean there is a rule of thumb, as you know, we have tried to bias the business very heavily toward intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, standoff warfare, the higher technology segments of the defense budget, and we tried to live less in the operations tempo, although we are not entirely outside of that. And generally speaking, we believe that's where the expenditures over time would be more heavily weighted. And so that should benefit us relative to others. But I think we have to wait and just see where it comes out. And of course, Friday will be the first shot and then there will be the negotiations and they will go through the committees and so on, and it will take some time to shake out from there. But we will at least have a sense of priorities. And of course, things like missile defense remain important, and that's a good part of what we do, both in ETG and the Flight Support Group within HEICO. So, I think we will continue to do that. Exactly. That's another good point, Louis. I think that \u2013 this is Victor. I think we are still seeing much heavier bias on defense. We are seeing some commercial start to awaken, which is really consistent with what we expected. I think people are feeling a little more comfortable about making some projections about where they might be and asking for pricing based upon a reasonable recovery in \u2013 at least privately. But for the most part, it remains heavily weighted towards defense or defense and space and other markets. You are welcome."

            "name": "Larry Mendelson",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us. We welcome you to the HEICO second quarter fiscal \u201821 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before beginning my review of the operating results, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for their loyalty and high performance during the continuing challenges brought on by COVID-19. The dedication to HEICO's customers and to the safety of their fellow team members has been commendable. And I want to thank every member of HEICO's worldwide team to be proud of what we accomplished during these unusual circumstances and to recognize that our future is very bright and we will exit this COVID-19 period, a stronger and more competitive company. I would now like to take a few moments to address the impact of COVID-19 on HEICO's recent operating results. Results of operation in the first 6 months and the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 continued to reflect the adverse impact from COVID-19. Most notably, demand for our commercial aviation products and services, continues to be moderated by the ongoing depressed commercial aerospace market, which we know is beginning to rebound and return to normal. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201821, we are cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will have and in fact is having a positive influence on commercial air travel and will generate more favorable economic environments in the markets that we serve. Summarizing the highlights of the first 6 months in second quarter of fiscal \u201821, we are pleased to report record quarterly net sales within the ETG Group and our third consecutive sequential increase in quarterly net sales and operating income of the Flight Support Group. The ETG Group set a quarterly net sales and operating income record in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821, improving 11% and 9% respectively. These increases principally reflect the impact from our profitable fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions as well as very strong organic growth of 19% for our other electronic products. The Flight Support Group reported sequential growth in operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821. And they improved 37% and 16% respectively as compared to the first quarter of fiscal \u201821. Our total debt to shareholders' equity reduced and improved to 27.1% as of April 30, \u201821 and that compared to 36.8% as of October 31, \u201820. Our net debt, which is total debt, less cash and cash equivalents of $199 million as of April 30, \u201821 compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 9.2% as of April 30, \u201821 and that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, \u201820. And this provides HEICO with substantial acquisition capital in the balance of our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as well as other available capital. We are not a capital constrained company. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.47x as of April 30, \u201821, down from 0.71x as of October 31, \u201820. During fiscal \u201821, we successfully completed one acquisition and we completed \u2013 we have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal \u201824 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes, which will accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities remain strong, increasing 2% to $210.1 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $205.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. In March \u201821, we acquired all of the business assets and certain liabilities of Pyramid Semiconductor. Pyramid is a specialty semiconductor designer and manufacturer, which offers a well-developed line of processors, static random access memory; electronically erasable, programmable, read-only memory and logic products on a diverse array of military, space and medical platforms. We do expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following the closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor and Eric. Moving on to details, the diluted earnings per share, consolidated net income per diluted share was $1.03 in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $1.44 in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support and higher income tax expense and that was partially offset by the previously mentioned higher operating income of the ETG group and lower interest expense. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $0.51 in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $0.55 in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in second quarter fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support partially offset by lower income tax expense as well as higher operating income of the ETG Group and lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $22.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 that was up from $21.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820 and totaled $45.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, up from $43.3 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the second quarter and first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects incremental impact from the fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions. R&D expense increased to $34.2 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $33.9 million, or 3.5% of net sales in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. R&D expense increased to $18 million, or 3.9% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from $16.8 million, or 3.6% of net sales second quarter of fiscal \u201820. We know that significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support. Our consolidated SG&A expense were $161.2 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $157.8 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $83 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $70.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense and the impact from our fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 acquisitions partially offset by reductions in other G&A expenses and selling expenses. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% in the first 6 months of \u201821, up from 16.2% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased to $17.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was up from 15.1% in the second quarter of \u201820. The increase in consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense. Interest expense decreased to $4.5 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821, down from $8 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Interest expense decreased to $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was down from $3.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 was principally due to a lower weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first 6 months and second quarter was not significant. Talking about income taxes. Our effective rate in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 was 12% as compared to 0.3% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. As previously mentioned, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 and \u201820. And that accounted for the majority of the decrease in the year-to-date effective tax rate. The tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods was the result of strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the option-ease holding period and the larger benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal \u201820 was the result of more stock options exercised in that period. Our effective tax rate decreased to 19.5% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and that was down from 22.6% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $11.5 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that compared to $13.4 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the Flight Support Group, in which non-controlling interests are held and that was partially offset by higher allocations of net income to non-controlling interest as a result of certain fiscal \u201820 acquisitions as well as an increase in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of the ETG Group, in which non-controlling interests are held. Net income to non-controlling interest was $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. For the full fiscal \u201821 year, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and non-controlling interest rate of between 24% and 26% of pre-tax income. Now, let's talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. One thing I want to mention that in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821, cash flow from operations was 146% of reported net income. So, the net income was $70.7 million and the cash flow was almost $103 million. Our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain very strong. As we discussed earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities increased 2% to $210.1 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and that was up slightly from $205.9 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. Our working capital ratio was 4.5 to 1 as of April 30 compared to 4.8 as of October 31, \u201821. Our day sales outstanding of receivables improved to 41 days as of April 30, \u201821, that was down slightly from 44 days as of April 30, \u201820. We continue to closely monitor receivable collection in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top five customers represented approximately 23% and 24% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 and \u201820 respectively. Inventory turnover rate was 153 days for the period ending April 30, \u201821 compared to 139 days for the period ended April 30, \u201820. The increased turnover rate principally reflects lower sales volume from the pandemic's impact on demand for certain of our commercial aerospace products and services. Despite the increased turnover rate, our subsidiaries have done an excellent job controlling inventory levels in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 and we believe that's appropriate to support expected future net sales as well as our increased backlog as of April 30, \u201821 which increased by $51 million to $895 million. Looking ahead, as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201821, we are cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will have a positive influence, and in fact, is having a positive influence on commercial air travel. And it will generate favorable economic environments in the markets that we serve. The pace of recovery in the global travel remains difficult to predict and can be negatively influenced by new COVID variants and varying vaccine adoption rates. Given those uncertainties, we cannot provide fiscal \u201821 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. We continue to estimate capital expenditures of approximately $40 million for fiscal \u201821. We believe that our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity, low debt enables us \u2013 and a degree of liquidity enables us to invest in new R&D development, enables us to execute on a successful acquisition program and positions HEICO for market share gains as the industry recovers. Again, in closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. During these professionally and personally challenging times, that strength will manifest from the culture of ownership, mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding our customers' expectations. We thank you all for everything you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I want to remind the listeners that a very high percentage of HEICO team members are HEICO shareowners through their 401(k) plans. We have many millionaires, multimillionaires and wealthy team members who all support the operation of HEICO. That's the extent of my planned remarks. And I would like to open the floor for any questions. Thank you. Operator? Good morning, Robert. I mean I thought there would be a bigger impact. I don't \u2013 we don't really see that. I think the number of opportunities is kind of normal. The ability to do the due diligence is getting a little bit better because we're able to access these places. But I would say things look about normal. I don't see any people running out. I think from what people tell me, a lot of people are discounting the 40% Biden threat for capital gain, and they are talking more about 25% or 28%. And at those rates, there doesn't seem to be a panic at this point. I think with Congress pretty close that Biden, my personal opinion is that I don't think he is going to get 40%, and I am not even sure if he is going to get 25% or 28%, he might. But there'll be a lot of pushback. So at this point, I would say, Rob, it's pretty normal. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, Josh. Good morning, Rob. Hi, Ken. Good morning Noah. Louis, this is Larry. I want to add my two sense to Eric and Carlos. I completely agree with that policy. Remember, please, that HEICO is one company. It's not 2 companies. It's not an ETG company and a Flight Support company. And when we talk about the results of HEICO, it's a combined operation. So, to give guidance in 1 division and not the other would be, in my opinion, totally improper, and it's not something that we are going to do. Thanks. Good morning. This is Larry. Let me handle the M&A question. We never speculate on LOIs or anything like that because even if we were to sign an LOI, it would be slightly misleading because there is a lot of due diligence that goes into it. And we signed confidentiality agreements all the time. We do due diligence, and we discover that it's not for us. So, I would never want to mislead the public and make them think, oh, we had this thing. But I think our comment that the pipeline is what we would call normal. We are looking at a number of transactions, and we can never predict which ones are really going to close. I mean we had some to be honest with you right now that looked very good at the beginning and as we get into them they look a little varied. So, those may if I had this conversation with you 2 months ago, I would say all this looks very good, we think we are going to close very soon and that would have been this weekend. So, it's still very close or may not, but I don't want to lead anybody in the wrong direction. Carlos? This is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank everybody on the call for your interest and your input. We look forward to improving conditions. We believe there will be improving conditions in the second half of our fiscal year and running into \u201822, barring any resumption of COVID issues or other kinds of problems. But we look forward to speaking to you at the third quarter call, which should be sometime towards the middle \u2013end of August. And in the meantime, if anybody has any question or comments, please call us. We are all available, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself, and we will be happy to speak with you and try to respond to your questions. So again, thank you all very much. And this is the end of our Q2 conference call."

The Flight Support Group's net sales were $429.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $553 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $230.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $252 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The net sales decrease in the first 6 months and second quarter of fiscal \u201821 is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $61.3 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $109.6 million in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating income decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned lower net sales as well as a lower gross profit margin, higher performance-based compensation expense, and the impact from lost fixed cost efficiencies stemming from the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $35.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to $47.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating income decrease in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects higher performance-based compensation expense, directly resulting from the strong improvement in operations during the past three consecutive quarters. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 14.3% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 19.8% in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the first 6 months of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned higher performance based compensation expense and lost fixed cost efficiencies and the lower gross profit margin. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 as compared to 18.9% in the second quarter of fiscal \u201820. The operating margin decrease in the second quarter of fiscal \u201821 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher performance based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Good morning, Rob, those are really good questions. As you can imagine, the quarter trended up as we went along in the quarter. And with the U.S. carriers, adding back capacity, we would anticipate that it will continue to trend up. Of course, Europe is very slow. Asia is a little bit mixed right now. But we'd anticipate as the airlines start operating more aircraft, they are going to need more parts. So I would say that's sort of what's expected right now. Of course, in the new build area, our specialty products area, that is still \u2013 that hasn't seen as much of a recovery. It is recovering. But of course, the new build is definitely more challenged and will take a little bit longer to respond than the aftermarket did. Hi, Eric. Good morning and thanks for your question. Yes, I think we called that correctly, and we were the first ones to call the end destocking when we did in December. And then, of course, in our last quarterly call in February. Right now, what we see is obviously accelerated sales. I mean, you can see the 16% increase Q1 to Q2, a consecutive increase. So obviously, the airlines are buying more. Our sense is that most of that is being used. Yes, some is \u2013 some inevitably will end up on the shelf. But we haven't seen what I would call the serious restocking yet. My guess is that they have got to get all the aircraft back into service. And then maybe the restocking starts at that point. Once the aircraft, the more intense restocking would start once the more, once a greater percentage of the fleet gets put into service. Also, if you look at the European numbers, the airlines are really suffering over there. And the \u2013 obviously, I don't think that they are restocking at this point. And that will come later in the cycle. So my guess is we start to see some restocking more in HEICO's fiscal 2022 area. Maybe there is a little bit of it in our fourth quarter, but it's hard to say at the moment. But we did correctly predict the end of the destocking. And I think that due to our relationships with our customers, we're going to be right there and understand when the airlines start to restock. I mean I have had conversations with airline executives, and I can tell you that they are very much focused. The airline \u2013 and I'm talking executives in major airlines, they are very much focused on making sure that they can complete the fights that they have got planned. And this is definitely a topic for the operations people and all the airlines. They are very much looking at this to make sure they have got the parts on the shelf. Yes, I'd be happy to. The answer is yes. I think that HEICO is picking up market share. We see it as we look into the \u2013 we've got very good visibility into the various products on which we are \u2013 which we supply parts for. And we would anticipate that, that will continue to pick up. The \u2013 when you look at the different areas of our business, whether it's parts or repair or distribution, I think we've got very good content in those areas. And we will continue to go ahead and pick up there. With regard to how this time is different from the other times, this time was so precipitous that we would anticipate that they would bounce back quicker because they just \u2013 as we said on the December call, they just couldn't continue to operate at the levels at which they were operating in the December area. I do think that the market share gain is going to be more pronounced for HEICO as compared to other suppliers because of the value that we generate. We were very good to our customers through this whole pandemic. We are very good to our team members. I think we're in a unique position to be able to respond and to take market share. And I think you're going to continue to see a market share shift, frankly, specifically towards HEICO as compared to other suppliers in the industry. Thank you. Yes. I think those are good questions, Larry. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball, and I don't know what the next number of quarters are going to be like. I mean, with the 16% growth that we saw in the second quarter, my sense is that, that quarter-over-quarter, that's a pretty hard number to beat. So I would I'm very \u2013 HEICO, we're very cautious. And we want to make sure that we've got the parts on the shelf. We're not over levered. We want to make sure that we've got the parts on the shelf so we can meet our customer demand. However, we want to be careful about getting over our skis. So I think 16% quarter-on-quarter improvement is very high. Who knows what it will be in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. I would be surprised to see that kind of improvement. I think our 16% number has surprised and frankly, it surprised us. I think it's probably surprising most people on the call today. And I do think part of that is a market share shift and HEICO winning in the marketplace because of how we behave during the pandemic. If you look at what IATA came out with this morning, they are predicting global passenger numbers will recover to 52% of pre-COVID levels in 2021 and rising to 88% in 2022 and 105% in 2023. So my guess is that it's going to be until 2023 in order to meet the 2019 numbers. Remember, HEICO year-end is in October. So therefore, for us to report 2022, equaling 2019, is much harder than foremost for others who would have 2 better months, if you will, in there. So I think it's really more of a 2023 story. But I mean, this is something that we're watching very, very carefully. If you look, it's really leisure travel that is saving the industry right now. And business travel is in the tank at a fraction of where it used to be. And international travel is in the tank also. And the airlines really have a skeleton network up to be able to support the international destinations. So I know the Biden administration is looking at changing rules and getting rid of 212 F and setting up these corridors between the United States and other countries. And I think this is going to be very important for the United States to lead because the United States has always done very well with the aerospace and defense industry and exports, and we really got to get out there and lead. They have got to get these travel corridors opened. So the airlines can start doing well on the longer haul as well as on the business travel. So I think those are the two things that I would really watch out for. Yes, Europe will be back this summer. It's starting to come back. But again, that's not a leisure . That's not on business, and it's not on long haul. So we really need the governments around the world to address this, and we certainly advocate for a safe via policy, whereby you have to show either a positive \u2013 either a vaccination or negative COVID test, one or the other. But the U.S. has really got to get out front in this and lead the world. Good morning, Josh. I would say it comes \u2013 Josh, this is Eric. I would say it comes from both. The bigger area, since we were already pretty much working with everybody, I think it would be more of increased penetration to everybody else, but there are other underrepresented. And I think that's a good term you're using to describe the opportunity, and we are seeing progress there as well. I think we're making progress in that area. There are a number of lessors who do use our parts. And I think that the tide is rising for us there. I mean this is not going to be an immediate switch. There are commercial reasons why some folks want to stay with OEM parts. But it is a substantial penalty to their customers. So we are making good progress in the area, and I think a lot more upside exists for us, and that's why I'm optimistic on it. Hi, Rob, it's Eric. I'd be happy to take that question. We've read the same in the trade press about Rolls-Royce and IATA being close to a deal. As you know, Rolls-Royce had a fairly closed and smaller network than the other manufacturers. So it was never a focus for HEICO. So I don't think that this is something that's a major opportunity for us. But if a customer wants us to go in that area, we'd be happy to talk to them. But I think Rolls due to the quantities of engines, the fact that they are wide-body engines and that in order to have them serviced, they would go into these various JV shops. I wouldn't see this as an area of focus for us. Yes. I think with regard to \u2013 certainly, with regard to our aftermarket business, I think we've got the opportunity to pass along the cost increases. If you look at the fact that we offer great value to our customers, I think that if our input costs went up, that we would have the ability to do that. I would fully anticipate that the OEM list prices will reflect this latest inflation pressure. And we're going to work very closely with our customers to explain if we've got to push along some cost increases, why we have to do that. We're all very familiar with the labor challenges in the United States these days and even to get standard materials. It's challenging on the consumer side. As far as on the manufacturing side, I think outside of things that are directly consumer facing, there is been less of that, but it is something that we're keeping a very, very close eye on to make sure that we were able to adjust our prices. We feel very confident I can tell you that as individual shareholders in HEICO, in the event there is greater inflation, as a shareholder of HEICO, I feel very confident that HEICO will be able to make up any potential valuation problems as a result of inflation. We're going to be able to increase our prices and eliminate that risk, in my opinion, as a shareholder. Thanks. Good morning, Ken. Yes, I can. I would be happy to do that. We saw, as you would anticipate, the area that we were, of course, down the most as compared to last year, would have been the commercial aerospace \u2013 commercial aviation because of the pandemic. And if you look at defense, that wasn't down to the extent that the commercial was. When you dig a little bit deeper, specialty products, which is the OEM supply, which is more predominantly OEM supply, that was down in the largest area with the parts and distribution and the component repair, not down nearly as much as the specialty products. But we do anticipate that with Airbus and Boeing increasing their build rates that specialty products will be coming behind \u2013 coming from behind very shortly here. I would think so. I don't have the numbers here in front of me to validate that. But I believe that would be the case here. Carlos can... I would say, in particular, it would be over in the PMA area. And as I talk with our sales folks and customers and understand what they want us to focus on. It's in basically what we have always called the adjacent white spaces as we broadened our product line, picking up products, which customers hadn't typically worked with us on in the past, and that's really the area where I would say I am most optimistic on that front. I would rather not because we don't \u2013 we try not to speak about particular customers or product types due to competitive reasons. We do have a number of our competitors on the call this morning, and I welcome them, but I would rather not give them a road map on where we are going. So, good morning Sheila, with regard to the share gains, I think it's against other PMA companies as well as other OEMs. So, it's both. With regard to USM, less than 10% of our sales are parts in excess of $5,000 over on the PMA side. So, we don't believe that we are exposed to the USM market. So therefore, it's not a major item for us. If there is used serviceable out there, I think it makes financial sense. It ultimately will get sold and will get used. But it's not really a big area of focus for us. We do have a subsidiary that does very well in the USM market primary, and provides us a glimpse into what's going on in that space. So, we are very knowledgeable about it. But \u2013 and for those reasons, we don't believe that there is much of an impact on our other businesses. So, the engine market has been more delayed than the non-engine market. I would say that it fell more precipitously. And it's also coming back a little slower as airlines focus on preserving cash, but that will go ahead and come back. A majority of our PMA business is in the non-engine market. We still do have engine parts exposure. And it's still an important part of the business for us. But as we have said historically, most of our business is in the non-engine side. Yes. I am not sure \u2013 I don't think we cut 25% of the headcount. What we did was we had limited layoffs and we also had furloughs, some of which were voluntary. And then for those who remained on the aftermarket space, we all took voluntary pay cuts. But HEICO retained a much larger percentage of our workforce than our peers in the commercial aviation space. So, we are in a very good position right now where we are able to generate our new product development. I mean there are a lot of other companies that gutted their new product development effort, HEICO did not do that. We have retained our skills. So, I think that we are in a very good and unique position to be able to gain market share and satisfy our customers going forward. By the way, Louis, this is Eric. In looking at some of our numbers, the larger layoffs did occur in our specialty products area, which are non-aftermarket facing businesses. So \u2013 and predominantly, most of the reduction was done in a particular facility in Asia due to just the lack of work. So, we feel very confident that we are going to be able to spool up that \u2013 those processes, those businesses have very well-defined processes and labor content, manufacturing processes. So, we feel that we are going to be in a very good position to be able to spool up. In the aftermarket space, our layoffs weren't anywhere near the number that you said. I think you may be referring to other companies that were in the aftermarket who cut their employment to those levels, but HEICO never did. And the Asia reduction, actually, some of that was government-mandated because there was ordered shutdown. And some of those... And frankly, Louis, this is Eric. Our 16% increase in Flight Support was so far beyond what we or anybody else thought was possible or doable. And I really give tremendous credit to our team members for accomplishing that. Had we given guidance 3 months ago, we would have missed it, and everybody would have said that we sandbagged it when, in fact, things just got much better, much quicker. So, I just don't think we are in a position right now to give guidance. It wouldn't be the responsible thing to do."

Certain statements in today's call will constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and contingencies. HEICO's actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements as a result of factors, including: the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; HEICO's liquidity and timing of cash generation; lower commercial air travel caused by COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath; airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, which could cause lower demand for our goods and services; product specification costs and requirements, which could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts, governmental and regulatory demands; export policies and restrictions; reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers; or competition from existing and new competitors, which could reduce our sales; our ability to introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels, which could reduce our sales or sales growth; development or manufacturing difficulties, which could increase our product development and manufacturing costs and delay sales; our ability to make acquisitions and achieve operating synergies from acquired businesses; customer credit risk, interest, foreign currency exchange and income tax rates; economic conditions within and outside of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries, which could negatively impact our costs and revenues; and defense spending or budget cuts, which could reduce our defense-related revenue. Parties receiving -- listening to this call or reading a transcript of this call are encouraged to review all of HEICO's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. I now turn the call over to Mr. Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and CEO. Thank you, sir.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to HEICO's First Quarter Fiscal '21 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I get into some of the detail, I would like to thank all of HEICO's extraordinary team members who have really performed in the most admirable way during this pandemic, which is now into about a year. As management looks at the company, we really believe that our success and the ability to keep our head well above water, not to get into any financial binds, not to struggle to sell debt at 8% or 10% and so forth and to be fiscally sound is all attributed to the unbelievable talent and brilliance of the team members. And I can tell you, senior management hold -- and the Board holds these people in the highest regard. So I thank them, and our hats are off to the entire team. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the impact on HEICO's operating results from the COVID pandemic. Results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal '21 continue to reflect adverse impact from COVID-19. Most notably, demand for commercial aviation products and services continues to be moderated and impacted negatively by ongoing depressed commercial aerospace markets. We continue to focus on health and safety measures at our facilities in accordance with the CDC guidelines in order to protect the global team members and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while serving our customers' needs. Keep in mind that almost all of our facilities were open continually since the start of the COVID pandemic. And very, very few members of our teams came down with this miserable disease. That was because of the safety measures and health measures that we employ throughout the company. Consolidated net sales for businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry decreased by about 43% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20. As we move further into fiscal '21, we acknowledge that factors such as the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, the emergence of new corona strain variant and distribution and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine will largely determine the timing and pace at which commercial aerospace will recover. As we mentioned in prior calls, we anticipate that as the pandemic vaccine becomes more widely available, consumer interest in commercial air travel should begin to reemerge. As such, we cautiously anticipate improved demand for our commercial aerospace products to slowly recover towards the second half of fiscal '21. Summarizing the highlights of our first quarter of fiscal '21 results. I would tell you that despite continuing difficult operating environment created by the pandemic, HEICO continues to generate excellent cash flow. And the cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong, increasing 32% to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up from $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in net sales and operating income at our Flight Support Group. Operating income and net sales at flight support increased 20% and 3%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, clearly an improvement that's obvious. Net sales for ETG, space and electronics products grew organically by a very strong 19% and 14%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal '21, while the ongoing pandemic's impact resulted in softer demand for its commercial aerospace products. In January 21, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, and this represented our 85th consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. HEICO's strength in the face of ongoing challenging conditions, coupled with our optimism for HEICO's future, gave our Board the confidence to continue paying a cash dividend through the current health pandemic. Total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 32.2% as of January 31, '21, and that compares to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $270.3 million as of January 31, '21, to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 13% as of January 31, '21. And that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.62x as of January 31, '21. And that was down from 0.71x on October 31, '20. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24, and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate the growth and maximize shareholder return. Last week, we publicly have proudly extended our congratulations to both NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratories, or known as JPL, on their successful Mars Perseverance Rover Landing. Our Apex Microtechnology, Sierra Microwave, 3D PLUS and VPT subsidiaries supplied mission-critical hardware for the mission. Once again, NASA and JPL demonstrated remarkable talent and capabilities despite a year of great challenges for the world's population, and they remain a beacon of optimism for all people. And we are extremely proud of HEICO companies and team members who contributed to this effort. I think we want to focus on the extreme technical ability and unbelievable quality that these -- our subsidiaries built into the electronics that they supply for that Mars Perseverance Rover Landing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $199.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $301.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales decrease is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $25.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $62 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales as well as a lower gross profit margin and the impact from lost fixed cost efficiencies stemming from the pandemic. The lower gross profit margin principally reflects the impact from lower net sales of commercial aerospace products and services across all of its product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 13.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 20.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned lost fixed cost efficiencies and the effect of higher intangible asset amortization expense. I would like to point out that the full impact of the pandemic began to affect the FSG operating segment at the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal '20. Through practical and disciplined cost management, we have delivered sequential quarterly improvements in our FSG operating margin. The FSG operating margin was just 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and has since steadily increased to 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and to 13% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our team members and assembled workforce is our most valuable asset. Our team members engaged primarily in commercial aviation sacrificed greatly during the pandemic through limited layoffs, moderate furloughs and wage reductions for nearly all others not impacted by layoffs or furloughs. These team members sacrificed a tremendous amount, and we owe our loyalty to them as we held on to a much higher percentage of our workforce than most others. Thus, we decided to operate with higher overhead, which reduced our gross margins and increased our SG&A. A lot of companies speak about how their team members are important. But HEICO demonstrates it through actions, including by maintaining our 401(k) matching contributions and granting our team members their maximum potential 401(k) profit sharing contributions, even though we missed our budgets due to the pandemic. We could have sacrificed the future in order to have better current period results, but that is not what HEICO is about. That's the luxury of being part of the HEICO family as we don't feel pressured to make short-term decisions that hurt future performance. We also treated our customers, suppliers, principles, partners and acquisitions extremely well and truly believe this helps us grow faster than the industry as people prefer dealing with us due to our culture. We are confident that our motivated and assembled workforce will propel us to new heights as the pandemic passes. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Eric, thank you. And I would also like to echo my gratitude to all of HEICO's team members, including those at the Electronic Technologies Group, for their remarkable efforts during this difficult time. About 90% of our people cannot work from home and have to come in. And our businesses have been operating as essential businesses throughout this pandemic very carefully and very safely and taking care of each other. And I'm very proud of the job that our people have done throughout this entire difficult period as well as the many years before, and I know that they'll continue to do the excellent work that they've carried out. As for the Electronic Technologies Group's performance, our net sales increased 7% to $223.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $208.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase is principally attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal '20 acquisitions. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 5% to $60.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $57.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. This increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 26.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 27.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The lower operating income as a percent of net sales principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from certain efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth. The lower gross profit margin mainly reflects a decrease in net sales with commercial aerospace products and lower net sales and a less favorable product mix of certain defense products, partially offset by an increase in net sales of certain electronics products. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Moving on to earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and that compared to $0.89 in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group and higher income tax expense, partially offset by less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest as well as lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $23 million in the first quarter of '21. That was up from $21.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the first quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the incremental impact of higher intangible asset amortization expense from our fiscal '20 acquisitions. Significant new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and flight support. R&D expense was $16.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 or about 3.9% of sales, and that compared to $17.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20 or 3.4% of sales. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 10% to $78.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $87.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense reflects: a decrease in performance-based compensation expense; a reduction in other selling expenses, including outside sales commission, marketing and travel; and the reduction in other G&A expenses. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 18.7% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales principally reflects higher other G&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and the impact from higher intangible asset amortization expense. Interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that was down from $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease was principally due to lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by a higher weighted average balance of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Other income in the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '20 was really not significant. HEICO's income tax expense was $2.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to an income tax benefit of $22.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '20 of $13.5 million and $47.6 million, respectively. The tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods was the result of the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the option lease holding period, and the $34.1 million larger benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal '20 was the result of more stock options which were exercised. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $5.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of flight support, in which noncontrolling interests are held. For the full FY '21, we now estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of approximately 24% to 26% of pretax income. Moving over to balance sheet and cash flow. The financial position of HEICO and forecasted cash flow remains very strong. As we mentioned earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong and increased 32% to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our working capital ratio was strong and consistent at 4.9x as of January 31, '21, and that compared to 4.8 as of October 31, '20. Days sales outstanding of receivables, DSOs, improved to 45 days as of January 31, '21, and that compared to 46 days as of January 31, '20. Of course, we continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top 5 customers represented about 24% and 22% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate increased to 164 days for the period ending January 31, '21. That compared to a pre pandemic 132 days for the period ended January 31, '20. The increase in the turnover rate principally reflects lower net sales volume, mainly resulting from the pandemic impact on certain -- on demand for certain of our products and services. And despite the increased turnover rate, our subsidiaries really have done an excellent job controlling inventory levels in the first quarter of fiscal '21, which we believe are appropriate to support expected future net sales. And in consideration of HEICO's consolidated backlog, which has increased by $62 million since October 31, '20, the backlog was $906 million as of January 31, '21. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '21, the pandemic will likely continue to negatively impact commercial aerospace and HEICO. Given this uncertainty, we cannot provide fiscal '21 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, healthy balance sheet and increased liquidity will permit us to invest in new research and development and gain market share as the industry recovers. In addition, our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring and operating high cash-generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aviation, such as defense, space and other high-end markets, including electronics and medical, puts us in a good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. Furthermore, we are cautiously optimistic that the vaccine progress may generate increased commercial air travel and will result in gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services businesses. And we expect that to commence primarily in the second half of fiscal '21, although we do expect it to increase gradually until we get there. In closing, I again want to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. That strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, our mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding customers' expectations. And we thank you for all you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I also would like to point out that in spite of the pandemic and in spite of decreased sales, HEICO wanted to look and reward our team members. And again, this year, we continue to make the 5% match to team members' 401(k) investments. As you know, most team members invest 6%, HEICO matches it with 5% of their salary in HEICO shares. We would never cut that back because we respect and we want to reward our outstanding team. Thank you. And now I'd like to open the floor for any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have your first question from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: Good set of numbers today. Larry, could I start with you on M&A? I think you said earlier that the company will continue to pursue a strong M&A policy. What are you seeing trend-wise in the market as the pandemic has evolved? Are sellers more or less willing to sell at this point?\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, we see a lot of product coming out of -- some of it coming out of private equity. So sellers are willing to sell. In the Flight Support Group, it's a little tougher because their profits have gone down, and a lot of them are pulling their sales activity hoping for recovery, which I know will be coming. However, in looking at our backlog of potential M&A possibilities, it's probably business as usual. And probably the difficulty hereof is the logistics of getting out, kicking the tires, checking and doing all these things. And that really has slowed us down a little bit, particularly when you're dealing with private equity guys. They have the information and they're more up to speed. But when you're dealing with private sellers who have never sold a company before, it becomes much more difficult. But the bottom line is we are seeing many opportunities, some at very reasonable prices. And we're kicking the tires. Others are at the 14, 16x EBITDA multiples, which price us out of the gate. And we are also looking at small companies that we traditionally buy size-wise, and we're looking at larger companies. So -- and of course, as you know, we are not physically constrained. We've been asked many times, would you use your currency, which is selling at a high multiple, for acquisition? And the answer is yes. We -- as a matter of fact, there's one transaction, I don't know if it'll ever close but -- where the seller wants HEICO shares. So our currency, we have cash. I said this on the last call, we have cash. We have stock and we have won them. So we're ready to give you -- give the sellers whatever they would like. I guess we'd give them bitcoin, too.\nRobert Spingarn: That was my next question. But in terms of the end markets, historically, you've been a little more active, on Victor's side of the business, with the defense and the space types of acquisitions. Are we seeing any more opportunity or less opportunity in commercial aero M&A?\nEric Mendelson: Rob, this is Eric. What -- we are seeing opportunity in commercial. But as my dad pointed out, the current level of earnings are depressed. So it's a little difficult to narrow down prices there, but we are still seeing plenty of opportunity.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Okay. Just a couple of other ones. Victor, I wanted to just ask you a couple of things about ETG. You have this very strong 19% and 14% growth in space and other electronics. Could you talk a little bit about what's driving that, and then separately, how defense did? And clearly, I guess, commercial aero was a factor as it's been across the industry.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Thank you, Rob. Those are good questions. On space, I think you heard us talk about throughout last year that we felt it would strengthen and will continue to strengthen into this year for us that we saw our backlogs building and orders increasing. And so that was really the follow-through on that. And I would expect that to continue for some period of time and then flatten out at some point. And -- but that really has been fairly broad-based for us on the space side, which has been very nice. And in terms of the other electronics markets, we started to see those firm up really in the fourth quarter a bit, and that followed through in the first quarter. We did see weakness, as I've talked about before, as the pandemic wore on. And I think perhaps inventories, there was a, call it, a destocking effect or inventories weren't built at all. And that's reversed, and I think we're seeing much more order inquiry out of our customers as well. So at the moment, that feels like it's continuing to move in the right direction. Commercial aero, still down but looking better, kind of bit by bit. I think the same general tone as you see with our Flight Support Group, I would say, should follow that same trajectory. And defense. Defense, at this point, we had some things that wound up getting delayed and moving out into the second quarter, not as a result really so much of our actions but supply chain as well as actually on the customer side with inspection and delivery on their end, things that have been built and were waiting for delivery. So we saw a little bit of that. And I would say I would expect as a rule of thumb, as we've talked about, to see defense generally flatten out as we move forward. I don't think that's any surprise to anybody. And I would expect us to see medical markets firm up as we move out. I think we all know they were tended to be softer last year because of the cessation of elective procedures and doctor visits and things like that. And I think that's beginning to reverse as people feel more comfortable returning to doctors' offices and so on.\nRobert Spingarn: Right. And just quickly on your margins. Your margins are always up there in the, call it, mid- to high 20s, but they dipped a little bit here in the quarter. I assume that's mix. And does that reflect commercial being down? Is there anything different this quarter about the level or magnitude of commercial? Or maybe it's something else? I just wanted to ask you about that.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Our commercial business is a very strong kind of business. So therefore, it's a high-margin business. So when that trails off, it tends to hit our margins. It was also mix on the defense side, definitely mix on the defense side. And I'll point out that the margins, I mean, we've talked about this before, we don't really go too hard after people. If we're running, let's say, 32% what I call cash margin, right, the real margin, and we have amortization in there, which is the -- obviously, the number, the operating margin that we report. But there's about 4 to 5 points of amortization, and there's probably this period an additional beyond that 0.5 point or so beyond what we saw last year, which was a further headwind. So if you take that out, it was actually much more comparable to where we were last year. But even so, I mean, if I look at it and I say -- I look at how we're doing, you've heard us say this before on many calls and in conferences and so on. I don't really -- we don't rack people on the knuckles if they're 100 basis points or 200 basis points lower and they're giving us 32% as opposed to 33% or 34%. And people ask, \"Where do you think your margins are going to be?\" I generally say, look, I think we're comfortable within this range, up or down 10%, although I think the up part is always hard. So that's consistent with what, I think, to be honest, what we are expecting.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Okay. Eric, just quickly. On order flow and air customer behavior, are you starting to see any signals of restocking of airlines trying to get set up for potential recovery here in the summer?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I'll answer that by saying I think we correctly called the bottom of the market in May as this was happening. And we also, in our fourth quarter, correctly called that destocking was over. And then other companies have since come out and said the same thing, but I think we were the first to talk about it. With regard to restocking, I wouldn't say that we've seen restocking so much as we've seen really depletion of inventory. And when customers order items, they need it right away. So we -- now that doesn't mean they're out of all inventory, but they're out of all parts. But the parts that they need, they really don't have on the shelf and there's not a lot of safety stock. So no, I don't think that we've seen restocking yet. I think they're being very careful. If you look, in particular, what's going on in Europe right now, with the passenger miles just cratered and really at the bottom, somewhat similar to what we saw in the spring, those airlines are not in a position right now to restock. And also, we're seeing it in a whole bunch of other markets as well. So no, I think that benefit is yet to come. And I would -- it's very hard to predict, obviously, with these variants and what's going to happen with the virus. But I don't think you're going to see a restocking until the airlines really start seeing that surge in travel, which we all know is going to come. But I think that they're going to really hold off on spending the cash until the last possible moment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.\nPeter Arment: I just wanted to follow up on just what Rob just asked about, Eric. Just I guess, maybe just to ask it a different way, less about the restock, but more about just qualitatively maybe some of the conversations you're having about potential pickup in share. I know you've talked about that in the past that coming out of downturns, you've been able to increase share. Maybe any color you could give us there would be helpful.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We're very optimistic. Yes, I've spoken with all of our sales heads to understand where the opportunities are and the color of those discussions. And I can tell you that they are extremely optimistic as well as our business heads are very optimistic in terms of the recovery and in terms of our position with respect to those customers. HEICO is no longer a small company. We're diversified. We're in many different areas. I think our customers trust us. They're relying on us to deliver cost savings, and I think that we're going to be in a very unique position going forward. If you look at most of our colleagues or competitors in the industry, I think that their cuts were far more aggressive. I know that their cuts were far more aggressive than ours. I alluded to in my comments that we held on to a much higher percentage of our workforce and protected a much higher percentage of our workforce than both our smaller and larger competitors. So I think we are in position. We don't have to rebuild a workforce. We don't have to remotivate a workforce. And I think we're going to be very strong in mining those opportunities. I can tell you that at the moment, things are difficult. There are some airlines that are working partial days, where they've decided to also try to hang on to their workforce and they're rotating them where people work a couple of days every other week. So it's more complicated, getting in touch with people. But I think where we've got those relationships and our people are very excited about both the new product that is coming out as well as the comments that we're getting from our customers. I think after going through a pandemic like this, buying the type of products that HEICO offers is a no-brainer because we generate savings without technical risk. So I think people understand that, and that's what specifically gives me the optimism.\nPeter Arment: Would you characterize that as just that you expect that your -- maybe your existing customers, you would expand kind of the reach there? And then maybe also, you're seeing some new customers show interest in your products?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would say that is correct. I mean there's not a lot of new customer opportunity because we pretty much deal with everybody. However, you're correct in that the existing, I would say, more penetrated customers are wanting to do more with us as well as customers where we are less penetrated, they're very focused on a whole variety of products that we offer that we haven't sold them in the past. And I think that we will continue to do very well. And also, I want to point out that even though we will take market share, in no means should this be interpreted that OEM businesses will not do well because we take a minority of the market share, we believe the majority for the OEM. The OEMs have been pretty aggressive with price increases, and we're just trying to take our little piece, and I think their business models are very much intact.\nPeter Arment: Right. Right. And then just two quick ones, Carlos. Just CapEx was up quite a bit year-over-year. And just wondering what the kind of the trend is there. Anything to call out? And then also just a clarification on what you expect the tax rate to be for the balance of the year.\nCarlos Macau: Sure, sure, sure. So CapEx was up. We had plans in our budgets to have some capital expansion in two of our facilities. Actually, they're both in the ETG group, where we are expanding their footprint with some new equipment and some more floor space for them to support their growth. And so that was -- about half that spend, if you would, was that type of growth expansion for the quarter, which we didn't see last year in the numbers. So that's why it's accelerated a bit.\nPeter Arment: And then on the tax rate?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. So the tax rate, I think what we're going to wind up seeing this year for HEICO is, Larry mentioned earlier that we expect 24% to 26% rate. I think that breaks down somewhere, 18% to 19% on the tax rate for the year, the effective tax rate. And then NCI could be 6% to 7%. Both those percentages are of pretax income. So that's kind of where my head is on those rates.\nPeter Arment: Nice results, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: First, for Carlos, was there any bad debt expense at FSG or elsewhere this quarter?\nCarlos Macau: I mean we always have a little bit of pluses and minuses on our normal cadence for HEICO. I think that's what we experienced in Q1. There were no bankruptcies, there weren't any large buckets or receivable days or anything like that. So it was -- on the bad debt side, it's pretty much business as usual under normal times in that regard. So no one-timers there or any amplified charges.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Because it was interesting, if you were to strip out the $1.5 million of bad debt in Q4, the incremental margin sequentially was like 49% in FSG. I just want to -- is that right? I mean that's what it is, right? I mean it's fairly high incremental margin.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. The incremental margins are high on the rebound, absolutely. We've seen that two consecutive quarters in a row now. If you look at it sequentially, that's correct.\nGautam Khanna: And maybe, Eric, if you could talk about FSG, if you're seeing any differing trends by the submarkets there? So the PMA products versus the repair and obviously, specialized products. But just if you could disaggregate what you're seeing in the various submarkets.\nEric Mendelson: Sure, Gautam. The -- obviously, the commercial aviation market continues to be down the most. And that would be in our parts business, which includes PMA and distribution as well as component overhaul as well as the specialty products that go to commercial applications and primarily new builds. The specialty products area has been down significantly in the commercial area. Not in the defense, but in the commercial area because as you see, the build rates have gone down. So the -- you'll see our aftermarket replacement parts was down actually a little less than repair and overhaul and specialty products. However, a lot of our military business also goes through there. So that's one of the reasons why. But I would say, in general, commercial is what was hit. Defense and space, still relatively strong, in particular, on the products that we provide. So if that gives you an indication.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. That's helpful. And is there any discernible difference between what you're seeing demand-wise in the distribution channel that you guys control versus the direct sales?\nEric Mendelson: No. I would say it's all in the similar area.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And then one for Victor, if you wouldn't mind, your comment, defense eventually flattens out. I'm just curious, what do you think the time frame is when that happens? We see the primes guiding kind of low single-digit growth for sales in 2021, I mean, do you think that's sort of where we end up tracking on the defense side of ETG and it declines from there? Or how should we frame it?\nVictor Mendelson: It's difficult to know, of course, in these early days of the administration, but it sort of feels like that to me. And I think they probably have as good a handle on it as anybody. And of course, budgets for -- the budget or budgets for '21 are really pretty set, and the direction is fairly well known. Although there can be variations for sure in the current government fiscal year. So I think they've got, like I said, a reasonable handle on the situation, as reasonable as anyone has. And I think we're all just waiting to see where it shakes out. And we're all watching certainly like, for example, daily comments now coming out of DC and the struggles in between various democrats, for example, I'll call them the hawks and the doves. And so we'll just kind of wait and see where it pans out. But I think in the very least, one thing it does seem is that there does not appear to be this movement toward the Budget Control Act that we saw in the Obama administration. And so I think that's a positive.\nGautam Khanna: That's helpful. And one for you, Larry. I was intrigued by your remark about one of the targets you're looking at would actually prefer stock. Is that -- anything you can say about that type of target? Is it -- would that be reserved for a large acquisition? Or in other words, you're not inclined to use stock on some of these $100 million deals, but it would have to be kind of one that moves the needle where you'd actually contemplate stock as the currency for M&A?\nLaurans Mendelson: As you know, our preference has always been to pay cash. Occasionally, we will get -- and it's very rare. We'll get somebody who prefers stock for -- probably for tax reasons, number one. And number two, because these people, well, certain ones, are really long-term believers in HEICO. So it doesn't really matter to us. If we want that acquisition and the only way we can make it is by giving stock, we would do it. And if -- as you know, we would still want to have it accretive as to earnings and cash. And it will have the same impact. I mean the alternative is we could sell stock and give them cash, but they don't want cash in this case. So again, if we want the deal badly enough, we would give them stock. But this is really an unusual case.\nGautam Khanna: Got it. And I should not infer that it's a big deal because of...\nLaurans Mendelson: No. No, you can't make any inferences from that at all. No.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Larry Solow from CJS Securities.\nPeter Lukas: It's Pete Lukas for Larry. You guys have covered most everything. Just one question, kind of a random one. Any thoughts on the price disparity or lack thereof between the common and the A shares. Discounts waned from over 20% 6 months ago to close to 5% today, which we think makes sense, but would love to hear your thoughts.\nLaurans Mendelson: We agree with you. We think it makes a lot of sense. We have no idea -- over the years, we've been asked this question many times, and we never really have the answer. I think -- we think now, and I think I'm speaking for everybody in the corporate office, we think it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense that the difference has shrunk so much. So -- but as to what the reason is, I guess, a lot of investors realize that they're better off buying the A shares at a discount and -- than the HEI shares. But that's all I can venture. It's just a guess.\nCarlos Macau: And maybe I'll add to that, we believe they should be a pari. I mean there should not even be a 5% discount at all when there had been times originally when the shares were issued, in fact, that they traded at par with HEI.\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, actually, they traded originally at a premium to HEI. \nCarlos Macau: There was a time, yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from Canaccord.\nKenneth Herbert: First, Victor, over the last couple of years, you've seen a really nice sequential step-up in margins within the ETG segment from the first to the second quarter. Can you -- sorry if I missed it earlier, but should we expect a similar step-up here in '21? Or how are you thinking about the margin progression off the first quarter?\nVictor Mendelson: I think we've got to be careful. At this point, there's still a little too much uncertainty. So -- and I think I'll stick with what I said before, which is pretty much within 10% or so of where we are feels pretty safe to me and a one way, up or down, in our margins, and we'll see where it comes out. Not trying to be evasive, but I just don't really know yet. We're still too early into the quarter.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. Fair enough. What was the amortization headwind in the quarter?\nCarlos Macau: Can I take it?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure.\nCarlos Macau: Ken, this is Carlos. There was about -- related to the acquisitions we did in the prior year, there was about $1.1 million roughly and an additional amortization expense that we absorbed for those acquisitions that was done around in Q1 of '20. So that would be the incremental uptick in amortization expense that went through the ETG's OI margin.\nKenneth Herbert: Perfect. And if I could, Eric, just one for you. We're starting to hear about some delays on OEM material, and perhaps that risk is getting a little greater just because of all the restructuring and cost cutting we've seen in the industry. As you look at your portfolio, I think clearly, that benefits the PMA product line, and that's always been an opportunity for you. Could perhaps be a risk on the distribution side, if you're seeing delays in some -- from some suppliers? Are you seeing any opportunities emerge potentially yet from the risk of delays from OEM material? And how do you think about that as it emerges, potentially presenting opportunities or risks to your segment?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. That's a good question, Ken. We are seeing some opportunities as a result of OEMs cutting back inventory. We were pretty careful to maintain in all of our businesses sufficient inventory because we're not capital constrained. And we need happy customers because we have an expansionary view of the market and our position in the market. So we want people to be very happy. And we don't deal from a view of perspective of scarcity. And we are seeing opportunities that you alluded to. I think that there are going to be pockets of opportunities. Having said that, I think the -- our competitors are -- our OEM competitors are well run, and they will be able to flex up and build the inventory that is required in order to satisfy the demand. So yes, I think it could help us get if you will, specked out on some products. So that is a potential area of opportunity for us.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. And just finally, Eric, there's been, obviously, unfortunately, some tragedies around the PW4000. I know you typically don't talk about types of engines, but I can imagine that's been a significant market for you over time. Are you seeing any potential incremental risk to the PW4000, if there's any sort of accelerated retirement or discontinuance of some of those engines?\nEric Mendelson: I don't think that, that's going to be a major impact to us. I will come out because of the unique extenuating circumstances of this and mention, of course, we do have HEICO parts on the PW4000 engine. We, of course, did not have anything on that engine which could have contributed to this kind of fan blade release. We're very knowledgeable about the incident. And it's for that reason that HEICO does not produce parts that are susceptible to this kind of issue. I think the FAA AD that they've come out with to mandate the thermal imaging of the hollow composite fan blade is sufficient and is appropriate. I would feel entirely comfortable flying on a PW4000-powered 777. I think that they're going to get this under control quickly. If you look, none of the incidents caused a crash. And so I think it shows that Pratt & Whitney did a great job and really designed a very high-quality product to be able to withstand such an event. So I do think that there will be opportunity for us to sell our parts as those engines do come in for service. As you know, roughly half of them have been grounded due to the pandemic. But I think that those are perfectly good aircraft, and Pratt is more than capable of resolving this issue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Carlos, the -- back to that discussion of the FSG margin and some of the moving pieces in there. I mean last quarter, you had quantified the bad debt expense, even though it was only $1.5 million. So the lack of quantification this quarter, can I interpret that to assume that, that is now pretty close to 0?\nCarlos Macau: No. Well, I wouldn't say it's zero. It's just more in the normal run rate. It's certainly less than the $1.5 million we had in Q1. It's not something, Noah, that sticks out or there was a flux in any of the numbers this quarter. It wasn't zero, but it certainly wasn't $1 million. \nNoah Poponak: Okay. Got it. And then you had also, over the last few quarters, spoke to the inventory obsolescence reserves in addition to that bad debt expense. And it was a somewhat sizable number in the back half of last year. Did you have that again in the fiscal first quarter?\nCarlos Macau: No. We have -- I guess, the answer to that question is we have a little bit of that right now. The bigger hits were taken last year because if you recall, last year, we had some specific reserves that we took for fleet retirements and aircraft that were being put down. So we took 100% reserve and some of that stuff that we had in stock. And then with the lower sales volumes that we're experiencing in FSG, you do get into this situation when you project demand over the near term, you do wind up a little bit of a kick to your slow-moving reserve. And so we have a little bit of that, but nothing that, Noah, is noteworthy to call out as being any different than it maybe would have been, let's say, in Q1 of '20. It is about the same pace.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. So those items are now kind of getting pretty close to normal or at normal. But your 1Q is usually seasonally the lower margin of the year. And then presumably, there's some volume pickup in the back half of the year. I guess how much of a margin lift through the year at FSG should we be looking at with what we know today?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I would say this, we've demonstrated the ability or the market has allowed us to participate in having sequential growth in the margin. And I don't foresee, even though we're not giving guidance or we're real careful, I don't see a scenario right now where we wouldn't continue that cadence. I don't think it's going to be a cliff up, if you would. I think it's going to be a steady progression back towards normal at some point. We're not going to get there in '21 in my judgment. But I do think we'll see marginal improvements as we play out the year and as our volumes pick up and that it's logical. If you think about the cost structure of the FSG, it is highly variable. We have very little fixed cost components. So as the volumes kick up, we do get cliffed in our margins. So you'll see that throughout '21.\nNoah Poponak: Got it. And then on the ETG margin, Carlos or Victor, you guys have spoken in the past to the lumpiness quarter-to-quarter from mix or other items. But you have specified that, that segment's margin should be in the 28% to 30% range over time. Just want to make sure that still holds and nothing has changed there.\nCarlos Macau: I mean -- this is Carlos, Noah. I think on an annual basis, because as we've talked about in the past, and you're aware of -- the quarter-by-quarter margins are real tough because you have push and pulls and it's a lumpy business. But I think on a normal year, and I'm not so sure I would call '21 a normal year yet, you know what I mean? In a normal year, I do see that segment in the 28% to 30% range. Could it be a tick lower? Are we going to tick higher? Of course, it could. But I think expectation-wise, if you're thinking about a normal year, that's the range, and we'll see how '21 plays out. I wouldn't necessarily call '21 a normal year yet, you know what I mean?\nNoah Poponak: Sure. Hopefully getting there. Okay. And then on the ETG organic revenue growth rate, that's been chopping around a bit in recent quarters with some of the -- with the nondefense pieces in there going against you. Looking at the model, starting next quarter, in your fiscal second quarter, you will be annualizing the start of the decline. Can that give us reason to expect the organic growth rate of the segment to start to consistently get back to a definitively positive territory?\nCarlos Macau: The answer to that question is I think our second quarter is straddled to this pandemic, right? So we kind of have half the quarter is good, half the quarter is shell-shocked. That was the initial byways that came in from this whole pandemic. So we got still kind of a lumpy Q2 to deal with. But yes, to answer your question, as we get into the back half of the year, the comps get easier. And as the business and the vaccine kicks in and people start traveling, we expect that the ETG's commercial aerospace business will pick up, and that will be helpful to the margin because that was the one area that drug us down this quarter compared to Q1 of '20.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And then just lastly, I wanted to dig a little further into free cash flow. Carlos, your fiscal '20 free cash flow is only down 5% despite all of the challenges. Your 1Q free cash is up again year-over-year despite comparing to a normal period of time. I guess where does that go from here? Is there anything that was abnormally helping fiscal '20 that reverses on you? Or should we be thinking that, that just grows '21 versus '20? I know you have the higher CapEx, but you still have it up in 1Q versus last year. Just any further thoughts on where you go from here with free cash flow of the business.\nCarlos Macau: No. Look, I think our free cash flow, if I think in terms of operating cash flow, I do think that as the year plays out, we should run on a conversion rate of, let's say, around 130% of net income. So that's traditionally about where we're granted. I believe we'll convert at that rate, which will help our free cash flow numbers that you're talking about. The problem is with -- and I want to be very careful because it is an uncertain time for us, predicting our net income number right now is hard to do. And so until we get to a point where -- I know when the numbers flush out, we'll probably see it converted 130-plus percent. I just -- I don't want -- I want to be careful not to give you some kind of guidance here that we have certainty on net income because right now, it's still in flux. As we get more -- I was just going to say, as our subsidiaries get more confident in their end markets, we'll start talking a little bit more about guidance and things like that. But right now, that's not on the table.\nNoah Poponak: That's helpful. And the capital expenditure piece, I think last quarter, you had discussed approximately $40 million for the year, which that would put the expansion effort pretty loaded into the number you just had for 1Q. Is that the case?\nCarlos Macau: That's correct. Yes, that's exactly the case. We had -- this is no surprise. We planned on this, and it was part of the $40 million.\nNoah Poponak: So that was back kind of sub-$10 million a quarter. And then '22 -- or beyond '21, it was a sort of a onetime thing. Beyond '21, goes back up?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I mean look, every year, we have the potential for one of our facilities graduating and having needs for bigger facilities or expansion. We always have growth capital that's planned. This year, to your point, in Q1, it's a little bit more amplified. But I think that if you're thinking about modeling or you're thinking about '22 and things like that, I think if you think along terms of our CapEx being somewhere between -- somewhere around 1.5% of sales, that's generally where we've trended. And that's kind of a conservative way to think about it and put your model together.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Nice results, as always. Maybe -- I don't know who wants to field this one, if it's Victor, Eric Carlos. But maybe just if you could touch on the backlog. I think you called it out as $906 million. So a nice little sequential uptick. Can you give us any more color there in terms of the breakout by segment? Were you seeing disproportionately more strength in ETG or FSG? And maybe some color on product lines there?\nCarlos Macau: I'll take a stab, and I'm sure the guys may want to follow up. The -- as you know, Michael, the FSG, for the most part, not everything, because we do have defense and that has backlog. But for the most part, the FSG, you kind of eat what you kill in the month, you get the order. It's a business that doesn't have a ton of backlog by its nature.  So a lot of the expansion that we're seeing in backlog has come in through FSG defense and through the ETG. And to parse that out within the ETG, we're seeing -- as Victor mentioned, we're seeing strength in some of our space backlog in this first half of the year and general electronics and things like that. I think defense and -- is pretty stable. It's lumpy, but the backlog is there right now. And commercial aero in ETG is down. So we're not seeing expansion of that backlog at the moment. So that's kind of the breakout of it.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just maybe a little bit more on, Eric, on some of the, call it, bookings trends you're seeing from some of the airlines. I mean obviously, there's still pretty significant reduced utilization of older planes. Can you help us or quantify? Are you seeing a significant amount of pickup on the parts side in support of the newer, younger fleet? I know you've been pretty guarded in the past on what kind of content you've got on the 87 and the 350, but are you guys positioned, do you think, to support a younger fleet as this kind of -- we emerge through this pandemic and presumably the fleet age tilts lower given the older retirements?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. That's a great question, Mike. Yes, I think the short answer is we are well positioned on the newer equipment. I think that we're going to do very well on that. A lot of customer interest and customer approvals in those areas. In addition, also to point that, we took the position early in the pandemic that a lot of these aircraft would not be retired as some have -- as some thought for the simple reason that they already exist and the lessors and the banks that would end up having to replace them, finds a new home for them, would have two options: one is to set it up for parts; or two is to go and lease it out. And we think leasing it out makes a lot more sense when you've got life on the aircraft. So we thought that the price of -- the rental rates, it was going to fall to the point where the new build was not going to make as much sense and where that was going to have a greater impact. Now of course, the wild card is the environmental impact of new equipment. And to the extent that governments, both in the United States and Europe, help subsidize, if you will, some of the newer equipment, that could have an impact. We haven't really seen much of that. And if you look, a lot of the build rates sort of have -- they underestimated the amount of the decline, and they're taking that down. So I would say that we're a little sanguine on the new build rates. Coming back to the 2019 levels. I think that a lot of the older, still economic equipment will continue to operate. And so I think we're going to be well positioned in both the new equipment as well as the older equipment.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And I mean, you're close enough to the customers. Presumably, I think everybody in this industry is watching oil prices, which keep climbing. That could kind of throw a wrench into keeping some of that older equipment, for sure, with these cash-strapped airlines. So I'm sure you guys are watching that indicator as well.\nEric Mendelson: We are. And I think a lot of the recent climb was due to the cold snap that we've had here in the United States. And that should pass, so I still think that the older equipment with its lower acquisition cost makes a lot of sense for the airlines. So I don't see them -- at this point, who wants to commit to newer equipment where you increase your cost base in the face of what we've just gone through? So I think the older equipment is going to hang in there and do well. And actually, the number of aircraft retired was even below what we thought it was going to be. And we were on the low side of the spectrum and the estimates on the retirement. I mean a lot of people spoke of big retirements, and we didn't share that view. But we're positioned well, I think, in both sides.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Last one I had, just Carlos, I think you guys called out this quarter all of commercial aerospace across the entity was down 43%. Did you have that number in the fourth quarter? Just trying to get a sense of the rate of decline there. I think you called it out for 2020 or fiscal '20 in total, but did you have what all of aero did in fiscal fourth quarter?\nCarlos Macau: I don't recall what it was in the fourth quarter off of that. You're right. We did disclose it for the year. It was like in the mid-30s or something like that for the year. I don't recall that -- what the fourth quarter was.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme from Sterling Capital.\nColin Ducharme: Most of my questions were answered, but just a quick one for Carlos. Perhaps just trying to take a look at the incremental margin progression from a different angle. You guys have kept human resources and capacity, given the culture, through the pandemic, totally understandable. But clearly, it seems to me like the business is built and can sustain, and with the current expense structure, a higher revenue level. And that's my question for Carlos. I mean if you had to back into how much incremental revenue, perhaps on a percentage basis, your current expense base from a human resourcing capacity could sustain, what your best guess might be?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I think that our businesses right now are positioned to handle quite a bit of sales growth in the FSG, which I think is what you're focusing on. Naturally, as that business picks up, we will have some hires to get back up to levels we saw in '19, but that's going to be a slow tick upward. And I think what we'll -- what you'll see happen is that as the sales grow, you will see us catching some more leverage in our fixed costs as that expands. But we will have some expenditures. I don't have a percentage for you because the problem, Colin is that we don't have total clarity on what those sales are going to be. We have a sense that they're going to rise, but we don't know the magnitude or the steepness of that rise. So we're very nimble, and we will flex as necessary. But as we're sitting here today, the current business can handle a pretty sizable jump in sales before we got to go out and make meaningful hires.\nColin Ducharme: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe 1 for Carlos and 1 for Eric. Carlos, you talked a little bit about OEMs continuing to push price, somewhat surprising given the health of the customer base through the pandemic. HEICO's franchise poised to take share. Can you talk about the price disparity, i.e., the umbrella? Is that widening over time, and therefore, better positioning you not just with the recovery, which would normally be a time for you to take share, but is that price umbrella making that opportunity even more positioning HEICO to be an even more attractive option as the economy recovers here? And then just quickly for Victor, congrats again on the Perseverance landing, very exciting for the company and for the country. You guys are putting a variety of parts, sensors, memory, et cetera, on electronic vehicles on Mars. Wondering if there's any crossover opportunity to participate in what is still an early but large and growing market for electronic vehicles here on Earth, where share positions are still fluid, if that's even on your radar?\nEric Mendelson: So this is Eric. I'll go ahead and start first. With respect to the pricing umbrella, we treat our committed customers extremely well. And so we moderate price increases for them if they commit to us for a long period of time. So yes, you're absolutely right that pricing umbrella does widen over time. And we can get to a point where, if somebody has been buying a part from us for 15 to 20 years, our price could end up being 70%, 80% below the OEM price and we're still able to earn a fair margin on it and we're able to give a very good value, and then we add more products as a result of that. There's no question that we've got the opportunity if we wanted to push pricing that we could. But we've decided that the future is much greater to us and we would rather continue on our growth path and sort of limit -- voluntarily limit those opportunities in order to capture more market share. The OEMs, I would say, this year, in general, their price increase -- I mean, they've been across the board. Some have decided to raise price substantially in order to make up all of the lost margin that they've surrendered due to the pandemic. Others have been slightly more moderate in their price increases. But I would say it's pretty much across the board of business as usual. So the HEICO value has even been enhanced during the pandemic. And then for Victor?\nVictor Mendelson: It's a very good question, and I appreciate you're asking it actually. It's insightful. And thank you, by the way, for the complement to our people and to our company on Perseverance. The answer is yes, some of our businesses are working on autonomous vehicles, cars, automobiles. And it's not -- I wouldn't call it a big part of our business. I think it has some potential for us. We'll see how it develops. Part of the question is we tend to be a high-end, higher-margin producer, as you know, and we tend not to be in the extreme high-volume, low-margin end, which is often where automotive lies. And so we'll have to see how it develops for us. Is it something that turns into an opportunity longer term? Or are we really more on the development end? So right now, what we're doing there tends to be more in the development end. Unfortunately, I can't tell specifically or disclose specifically the companies we're working with, the programs were on because we're subject to some confidentiality agreements on those, and they want it kept secret. But if -- by the way, I can say it's not just the automotive companies, but it's the tech companies as well who are involved with automotive applications. And Carlos, do you have...\nCarlos Macau: I couldn't have said it better, Victor. I couldn't have said it better.\nVictor Mendelson: Was there one that you were going to answer?\nCarlos Macau: I think Eric took care of it actually.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Greg Konrad from Jefferies.\nGregory Konrad: Just quick -- two quick follow-ups. One on ETG. I think last year, defense and space was about 2/3 of the segment. Any granularity around the breakout? And then you mentioned space was broad-based in terms of opportunities. Any color around drivers? I mean you mentioned Mars Rover, but how much is government versus maybe some of these new commercial space opportunities we hear about?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. So just in terms of giving you a sense of the breakdown sales, it's comparable to where it's been. I mean it's a little better than half is defense. And commercial space is around the 10% range. And then other markets, other electronics and government markets, kind of about 1/4; and our medical bounces around 5% to 10%; and commercial aviation is sub-10% now, between 5% and 10%, running between 5% and 10%. And I would expect commercial aviation to get back up more toward 10% as the year wears on or as we get into next year, certainly, based on what we know today and how things are doing. And on the space side, you're right, of course, Perseverance, there was no revenue in the quarter from that as that launched, of course, in July of last year. But it's broad-based. It tends to be more satellites. It's most heavily satellites and most heavily communication satellites. The space exploration part of the business is nice. And it is a profitable business for us, but it is not the bread-and-butter part, if you will. It tends to be the branding rights, if you will, for us, and it tends to be the more noteworthy. But obviously, there are not a lot of Rovers built each year and launched each year. But when you get into Earth observation, there are a number of growth observation satellites that we're on, that we're getting on, that our companies are supplying components on and as well as some launch vehicles. So that's broadly where we mine.\nGregory Konrad: And then just a quick question on FSG. I mean you mentioned you're up earlier in the call. When we think about the eventual improvement of the aftermarket, should that kind of follow the capacity trends that we're seeing in the regions with [indiscernible] recovering ahead of others? And is that kind of what we should be looking at in terms of regional trends?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Absolutely. I think you nailed it. There may be a little bit of a recovery slightly before that as airlines get prepared, if they start to see bookings, I think that could drive it, drive an early recovery. They got to make sure that they've got the aircraft ready for, I believe, what's going to be a surge down the road.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have another question from Louis Raffetto from UBS.\nLouis Raffetto: Just take one from me. Carlos, the SG&A trended up a bit in the quarter. Is that some of the performance comp coming back in? Is that also maybe what weighed a little bit on the FSG margins? Because I think if you add back the bad debt expense and the inventory reserves, sort of the clean margins did tick down, but is that just maybe some of that SG&A coming back?\nCarlos Macau: The performance-based comp in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021 were fairly comparable. So -- because remember, last year, we had very low bonuses. So this year, we're wanting to take care of our folks as we do see some green shoots in the process going forward. So I think what we're seeing, to be candid with you, Lou, is that as the sales have started to tick up a little bit, we're still not catching the leverage in our SG&A that we experienced in Q1 of '20. We had a great quarter in '20. And comparatively speaking, it's some of the fixed cost inefficiencies, is the only way I could think to put it, that we're experiencing when compared to Q1 '20. I don't think it has anything to do with performance-based comp.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And then, Eric, the talk of the share taking, I guess, is that -- do you see that more on the parts side or the MRO side? I just -- obviously, the parts, to your point, you have 70% to 80% lower prices in some cases. That's extremely competitive. Are you as competitive on the MRO side? Just trying to get a sense of where you think that share taking could take place?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think it's really across the board in all of our businesses. Yes, you're right that the -- first of all, the 70% to 80% price benefit would be for, as I mentioned, for a customer who's committed to us and who's been buying something for, say, 15 to 20 years. So -- and that would be the maximum. I mean that's not where we come out of the box. So if you look at repair, typically, parts as a percentage of repairs, just say, roughly 40% of the cost. So you're right that the extreme cost benefit would be more on the -- in particular, on the PMA side. But I think we're very competitive across the board in everything that we do.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. And Victor, just for you, to your earlier point, aviation is now 5% to 10% of ETG. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's primarily OEM. So where is the uncertainty in ETG? I mean defense, all defense primes have guidance, just what else is it that you guys are particularly so uncertain about in that business?\nVictor Mendelson: So Lou, this is Victor. The business is roughly split between OEM and aftermarket in ETG for commercial aviation. So that pretty much explains what we're looking at, right? I mean if you've got the uncertainty in aftermarket, which is improving and the uncertainty in new production, which I think is also probably moving in the right direction. I mean there was a lot of disruption in new aircraft production rates and shifting, which seems to be moving again in the right direction. And we've got the MAX, which is now resuming production that had stopped. And so that's why generally optimistic about the direction that we're moving in commercial aviation. I just don't know the exact timing.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And I think that earlier number someone asked about, I think it was minus 49.5% for the fourth quarter. So just so it's there.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Mendelson, please continue.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody on the call for your interest in HEICO. As you know, we remain available, if you have questions, give us a call. Eric, Victor, Carlos or I will be happy to speak with you. And if not, we look forward to speaking to you at the Q2 conference, which will be in about 3 months. So stay well, stay healthy. Hopefully, get vaccines. And we'll speak to you real soon. Thank you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Sure, sure, sure. So CapEx was up. We had plans in our budgets to have some capital expansion in two of our facilities. Actually, they're both in the ETG group, where we are expanding their footprint with some new equipment and some more floor space for them to support their growth. And so that was -- about half that spend, if you would, was that type of growth expansion for the quarter, which we didn't see last year in the numbers. So that's why it's accelerated a bit. Yes. So the tax rate, I think what we're going to wind up seeing this year for HEICO is, Larry mentioned earlier that we expect 24% to 26% rate. I think that breaks down somewhere, 18% to 19% on the tax rate for the year, the effective tax rate. And then NCI could be 6% to 7%. Both those percentages are of pretax income. So that's kind of where my head is on those rates. I mean we always have a little bit of pluses and minuses on our normal cadence for HEICO. I think that's what we experienced in Q1. There were no bankruptcies, there weren't any large buckets or receivable days or anything like that. So it was -- on the bad debt side, it's pretty much business as usual under normal times in that regard. So no one-timers there or any amplified charges. Yes. The incremental margins are high on the rebound, absolutely. We've seen that two consecutive quarters in a row now. If you look at it sequentially, that's correct. And maybe I'll add to that, we believe they should be a pari. I mean there should not even be a 5% discount at all when there had been times originally when the shares were issued, in fact, that they traded at par with HEI. There was a time, yes. Can I take it? Ken, this is Carlos. There was about -- related to the acquisitions we did in the prior year, there was about $1.1 million roughly and an additional amortization expense that we absorbed for those acquisitions that was done around in Q1 of '20. So that would be the incremental uptick in amortization expense that went through the ETG's OI margin. No. Well, I wouldn't say it's zero. It's just more in the normal run rate. It's certainly less than the $1.5 million we had in Q1. It's not something, Noah, that sticks out or there was a flux in any of the numbers this quarter. It wasn't zero, but it certainly wasn't $1 million. No. We have -- I guess, the answer to that question is we have a little bit of that right now. The bigger hits were taken last year because if you recall, last year, we had some specific reserves that we took for fleet retirements and aircraft that were being put down. So we took 100% reserve and some of that stuff that we had in stock. And then with the lower sales volumes that we're experiencing in FSG, you do get into this situation when you project demand over the near term, you do wind up a little bit of a kick to your slow-moving reserve. And so we have a little bit of that, but nothing that, Noah, is noteworthy to call out as being any different than it maybe would have been, let's say, in Q1 of '20. It is about the same pace. Well, I would say this, we've demonstrated the ability or the market has allowed us to participate in having sequential growth in the margin. And I don't foresee, even though we're not giving guidance or we're real careful, I don't see a scenario right now where we wouldn't continue that cadence. I don't think it's going to be a cliff up, if you would. I think it's going to be a steady progression back towards normal at some point. We're not going to get there in '21 in my judgment. But I do think we'll see marginal improvements as we play out the year and as our volumes pick up and that it's logical. If you think about the cost structure of the FSG, it is highly variable. We have very little fixed cost components. So as the volumes kick up, we do get cliffed in our margins. So you'll see that throughout '21. I mean -- this is Carlos, Noah. I think on an annual basis, because as we've talked about in the past, and you're aware of -- the quarter-by-quarter margins are real tough because you have push and pulls and it's a lumpy business. But I think on a normal year, and I'm not so sure I would call '21 a normal year yet, you know what I mean? In a normal year, I do see that segment in the 28% to 30% range. Could it be a tick lower? Are we going to tick higher? Of course, it could. But I think expectation-wise, if you're thinking about a normal year, that's the range, and we'll see how '21 plays out. I wouldn't necessarily call '21 a normal year yet, you know what I mean? The answer to that question is I think our second quarter is straddled to this pandemic, right? So we kind of have half the quarter is good, half the quarter is shell-shocked. That was the initial byways that came in from this whole pandemic. So we got still kind of a lumpy Q2 to deal with. But yes, to answer your question, as we get into the back half of the year, the comps get easier. And as the business and the vaccine kicks in and people start traveling, we expect that the ETG's commercial aerospace business will pick up, and that will be helpful to the margin because that was the one area that drug us down this quarter compared to Q1 of '20. No. Look, I think our free cash flow, if I think in terms of operating cash flow, I do think that as the year plays out, we should run on a conversion rate of, let's say, around 130% of net income. So that's traditionally about where we're granted. I believe we'll convert at that rate, which will help our free cash flow numbers that you're talking about. The problem is with -- and I want to be very careful because it is an uncertain time for us, predicting our net income number right now is hard to do. And so until we get to a point where -- I know when the numbers flush out, we'll probably see it converted 130-plus percent. I just -- I don't want -- I want to be careful not to give you some kind of guidance here that we have certainty on net income because right now, it's still in flux. As we get more -- I was just going to say, as our subsidiaries get more confident in their end markets, we'll start talking a little bit more about guidance and things like that. But right now, that's not on the table. That's correct. Yes, that's exactly the case. We had -- this is no surprise. We planned on this, and it was part of the $40 million. Yes. I mean look, every year, we have the potential for one of our facilities graduating and having needs for bigger facilities or expansion. We always have growth capital that's planned. This year, to your point, in Q1, it's a little bit more amplified. But I think that if you're thinking about modeling or you're thinking about '22 and things like that, I think if you think along terms of our CapEx being somewhere between -- somewhere around 1.5% of sales, that's generally where we've trended. And that's kind of a conservative way to think about it and put your model together. I'll take a stab, and I'm sure the guys may want to follow up. The -- as you know, Michael, the FSG, for the most part, not everything, because we do have defense and that has backlog. But for the most part, the FSG, you kind of eat what you kill in the month, you get the order. It's a business that doesn't have a ton of backlog by its nature.  So a lot of the expansion that we're seeing in backlog has come in through FSG defense and through the ETG. And to parse that out within the ETG, we're seeing -- as Victor mentioned, we're seeing strength in some of our space backlog in this first half of the year and general electronics and things like that. I think defense and -- is pretty stable. It's lumpy, but the backlog is there right now. And commercial aero in ETG is down. So we're not seeing expansion of that backlog at the moment. So that's kind of the breakout of it. I don't recall what it was in the fourth quarter off of that. You're right. We did disclose it for the year. It was like in the mid-30s or something like that for the year. I don't recall that -- what the fourth quarter was. Well, I think that our businesses right now are positioned to handle quite a bit of sales growth in the FSG, which I think is what you're focusing on. Naturally, as that business picks up, we will have some hires to get back up to levels we saw in '19, but that's going to be a slow tick upward. And I think what we'll -- what you'll see happen is that as the sales grow, you will see us catching some more leverage in our fixed costs as that expands. But we will have some expenditures. I don't have a percentage for you because the problem, Colin is that we don't have total clarity on what those sales are going to be. We have a sense that they're going to rise, but we don't know the magnitude or the steepness of that rise. So we're very nimble, and we will flex as necessary. But as we're sitting here today, the current business can handle a pretty sizable jump in sales before we got to go out and make meaningful hires. I couldn't have said it better, Victor. I couldn't have said it better. I think Eric took care of it actually. The performance-based comp in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021 were fairly comparable. So -- because remember, last year, we had very low bonuses. So this year, we're wanting to take care of our folks as we do see some green shoots in the process going forward.

We had a great quarter in '20. And comparatively speaking, it's some of the fixed cost inefficiencies, is the only way I could think to put it, that we're experiencing when compared to Q1 '20. I don't think it has anything to do with performance-based comp."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Eric, thank you. And I would also like to echo my gratitude to all of HEICO's team members, including those at the Electronic Technologies Group, for their remarkable efforts during this difficult time. About 90% of our people cannot work from home and have to come in. And our businesses have been operating as essential businesses throughout this pandemic very carefully and very safely and taking care of each other. And I'm very proud of the job that our people have done throughout this entire difficult period as well as the many years before, and I know that they'll continue to do the excellent work that they've carried out. As for the Electronic Technologies Group's performance, our net sales increased 7% to $223.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $208.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase is principally attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal '20 acquisitions. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 5% to $60.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $57.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. This increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 26.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 27.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The lower operating income as a percent of net sales principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from certain efficiencies gained from the previously mentioned net sales growth. The lower gross profit margin mainly reflects a decrease in net sales with commercial aerospace products and lower net sales and a less favorable product mix of certain defense products, partially offset by an increase in net sales of certain electronics products. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes. Thank you, Rob. Those are good questions. On space, I think you heard us talk about throughout last year that we felt it would strengthen and will continue to strengthen into this year for us that we saw our backlogs building and orders increasing. And so that was really the follow-through on that. And I would expect that to continue for some period of time and then flatten out at some point. And -- but that really has been fairly broad-based for us on the space side, which has been very nice. And in terms of the other electronics markets, we started to see those firm up really in the fourth quarter a bit, and that followed through in the first quarter. We did see weakness, as I've talked about before, as the pandemic wore on. And I think perhaps inventories, there was a, call it, a destocking effect or inventories weren't built at all. And that's reversed, and I think we're seeing much more order inquiry out of our customers as well. So at the moment, that feels like it's continuing to move in the right direction. Commercial aero, still down but looking better, kind of bit by bit. I think the same general tone as you see with our Flight Support Group, I would say, should follow that same trajectory. And defense. Defense, at this point, we had some things that wound up getting delayed and moving out into the second quarter, not as a result really so much of our actions but supply chain as well as actually on the customer side with inspection and delivery on their end, things that have been built and were waiting for delivery. So we saw a little bit of that. And I would say I would expect as a rule of thumb, as we've talked about, to see defense generally flatten out as we move forward. I don't think that's any surprise to anybody. And I would expect us to see medical markets firm up as we move out. I think we all know they were tended to be softer last year because of the cessation of elective procedures and doctor visits and things like that. And I think that's beginning to reverse as people feel more comfortable returning to doctors' offices and so on. Yes. Our commercial business is a very strong kind of business. So therefore, it's a high-margin business. So when that trails off, it tends to hit our margins. It was also mix on the defense side, definitely mix on the defense side. And I'll point out that the margins, I mean, we've talked about this before, we don't really go too hard after people. If we're running, let's say, 32% what I call cash margin, right, the real margin, and we have amortization in there, which is the -- obviously, the number, the operating margin that we report. But there's about 4 to 5 points of amortization, and there's probably this period an additional beyond that 0.5 point or so beyond what we saw last year, which was a further headwind. So if you take that out, it was actually much more comparable to where we were last year. But even so, I mean, if I look at it and I say -- I look at how we're doing, you've heard us say this before on many calls and in conferences and so on. I don't really -- we don't rack people on the knuckles if they're 100 basis points or 200 basis points lower and they're giving us 32% as opposed to 33% or 34%. And people ask, \"Where do you think your margins are going to be?\" I generally say, look, I think we're comfortable within this range, up or down 10%, although I think the up part is always hard. So that's consistent with what, I think, to be honest, what we are expecting. It's difficult to know, of course, in these early days of the administration, but it sort of feels like that to me. And I think they probably have as good a handle on it as anybody. And of course, budgets for -- the budget or budgets for '21 are really pretty set, and the direction is fairly well known. Although there can be variations for sure in the current government fiscal year. So I think they've got, like I said, a reasonable handle on the situation, as reasonable as anyone has. And I think we're all just waiting to see where it shakes out. And we're all watching certainly like, for example, daily comments now coming out of DC and the struggles in between various democrats, for example, I'll call them the hawks and the doves. And so we'll just kind of wait and see where it pans out. But I think in the very least, one thing it does seem is that there does not appear to be this movement toward the Budget Control Act that we saw in the Obama administration. And so I think that's a positive. I think we've got to be careful. At this point, there's still a little too much uncertainty. So -- and I think I'll stick with what I said before, which is pretty much within 10% or so of where we are feels pretty safe to me and a one way, up or down, in our margins, and we'll see where it comes out. Not trying to be evasive, but I just don't really know yet. We're still too early into the quarter. Sure. It's a very good question, and I appreciate you're asking it actually. It's insightful. And thank you, by the way, for the complement to our people and to our company on Perseverance. The answer is yes, some of our businesses are working on autonomous vehicles, cars, automobiles. And it's not -- I wouldn't call it a big part of our business. I think it has some potential for us. We'll see how it develops. Part of the question is we tend to be a high-end, higher-margin producer, as you know, and we tend not to be in the extreme high-volume, low-margin end, which is often where automotive lies. And so we'll have to see how it develops for us. Is it something that turns into an opportunity longer term? Or are we really more on the development end? So right now, what we're doing there tends to be more in the development end. Unfortunately, I can't tell specifically or disclose specifically the companies we're working with, the programs were on because we're subject to some confidentiality agreements on those, and they want it kept secret. But if -- by the way, I can say it's not just the automotive companies, but it's the tech companies as well who are involved with automotive applications. And Carlos, do you have... Was there one that you were going to answer? Yes. So just in terms of giving you a sense of the breakdown sales, it's comparable to where it's been. I mean it's a little better than half is defense. And commercial space is around the 10% range. And then other markets, other electronics and government markets, kind of about 1/4; and our medical bounces around 5% to 10%; and commercial aviation is sub-10% now, between 5% and 10%, running between 5% and 10%. And I would expect commercial aviation to get back up more toward 10% as the year wears on or as we get into next year, certainly, based on what we know today and how things are doing. And on the space side, you're right, of course, Perseverance, there was no revenue in the quarter from that as that launched, of course, in July of last year. But it's broad-based. It tends to be more satellites. It's most heavily satellites and most heavily communication satellites. The space exploration part of the business is nice. And it is a profitable business for us, but it is not the bread-and-butter part, if you will. It tends to be the branding rights, if you will, for us, and it tends to be the more noteworthy. But obviously, there are not a lot of Rovers built each year and launched each year. But when you get into Earth observation, there are a number of growth observation satellites that we're on, that we're getting on, that our companies are supplying components on and as well as some launch vehicles. So that's broadly where we mine. So Lou, this is Victor. The business is roughly split between OEM and aftermarket in ETG for commercial aviation. So that pretty much explains what we're looking at, right? I mean if you've got the uncertainty in aftermarket, which is improving and the uncertainty in new production, which I think is also probably moving in the right direction. I mean there was a lot of disruption in new aircraft production rates and shifting, which seems to be moving again in the right direction. And we've got the MAX, which is now resuming production that had stopped. And so that's why generally optimistic about the direction that we're moving in commercial aviation. I just don't know the exact timing."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to HEICO's First Quarter Fiscal '21 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I get into some of the detail, I would like to thank all of HEICO's extraordinary team members who have really performed in the most admirable way during this pandemic, which is now into about a year. As management looks at the company, we really believe that our success and the ability to keep our head well above water, not to get into any financial binds, not to struggle to sell debt at 8% or 10% and so forth and to be fiscally sound is all attributed to the unbelievable talent and brilliance of the team members. And I can tell you, senior management hold -- and the Board holds these people in the highest regard. So I thank them, and our hats are off to the entire team. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the impact on HEICO's operating results from the COVID pandemic. Results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal '21 continue to reflect adverse impact from COVID-19. Most notably, demand for commercial aviation products and services continues to be moderated and impacted negatively by ongoing depressed commercial aerospace markets. We continue to focus on health and safety measures at our facilities in accordance with the CDC guidelines in order to protect the global team members and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while serving our customers' needs. Keep in mind that almost all of our facilities were open continually since the start of the COVID pandemic. And very, very few members of our teams came down with this miserable disease. That was because of the safety measures and health measures that we employ throughout the company. Consolidated net sales for businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry decreased by about 43% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20. As we move further into fiscal '21, we acknowledge that factors such as the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, the emergence of new corona strain variant and distribution and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine will largely determine the timing and pace at which commercial aerospace will recover. As we mentioned in prior calls, we anticipate that as the pandemic vaccine becomes more widely available, consumer interest in commercial air travel should begin to reemerge. As such, we cautiously anticipate improved demand for our commercial aerospace products to slowly recover towards the second half of fiscal '21. Summarizing the highlights of our first quarter of fiscal '21 results. I would tell you that despite continuing difficult operating environment created by the pandemic, HEICO continues to generate excellent cash flow. And the cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong, increasing 32% to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that was up from $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in net sales and operating income at our Flight Support Group. Operating income and net sales at flight support increased 20% and 3%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20, clearly an improvement that's obvious. Net sales for ETG, space and electronics products grew organically by a very strong 19% and 14%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal '21, while the ongoing pandemic's impact resulted in softer demand for its commercial aerospace products. In January 21, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.08 per share, and this represented our 85th consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. HEICO's strength in the face of ongoing challenging conditions, coupled with our optimism for HEICO's future, gave our Board the confidence to continue paying a cash dividend through the current health pandemic. Total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 32.2% as of January 31, '21, and that compares to 36.8% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $270.3 million as of January 31, '21, to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 13% as of January 31, '21. And that was down from 16.6% as of October 31, '20. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.62x as of January 31, '21. And that was down from 0.71x on October 31, '20. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24, and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate the growth and maximize shareholder return. Last week, we publicly have proudly extended our congratulations to both NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratories, or known as JPL, on their successful Mars Perseverance Rover Landing. Our Apex Microtechnology, Sierra Microwave, 3D PLUS and VPT subsidiaries supplied mission-critical hardware for the mission. Once again, NASA and JPL demonstrated remarkable talent and capabilities despite a year of great challenges for the world's population, and they remain a beacon of optimism for all people. And we are extremely proud of HEICO companies and team members who contributed to this effort. I think we want to focus on the extreme technical ability and unbelievable quality that these -- our subsidiaries built into the electronics that they supply for that Mars Perseverance Rover Landing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Moving on to earnings per share. Consolidated net income per diluted share was $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and that compared to $0.89 in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower operating income of the Flight Support Group and higher income tax expense, partially offset by less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest as well as lower interest expense. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $23 million in the first quarter of '21. That was up from $21.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the first quarter of fiscal '21 principally reflects the incremental impact of higher intangible asset amortization expense from our fiscal '20 acquisitions. Significant new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and flight support. R&D expense was $16.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 or about 3.9% of sales, and that compared to $17.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20 or 3.4% of sales. Consolidated SG&A expense decreased by 10% to $78.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $87.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease in consolidated SG&A expense reflects: a decrease in performance-based compensation expense; a reduction in other selling expenses, including outside sales commission, marketing and travel; and the reduction in other G&A expenses. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 18.7% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The increase in the consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales principally reflects higher other G&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and the impact from higher intangible asset amortization expense. Interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that was down from $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease was principally due to lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by a higher weighted average balance of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Other income in the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '20 was really not significant. HEICO's income tax expense was $2.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to an income tax benefit of $22.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '20 of $13.5 million and $47.6 million, respectively. The tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods was the result of the strong appreciation in HEICO's stock price during the option lease holding period, and the $34.1 million larger benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal '20 was the result of more stock options which were exercised. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $5.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, and that compared to $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The decrease principally reflects a decrease in the operating results of certain subsidiaries of flight support, in which noncontrolling interests are held. For the full FY '21, we now estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of approximately 24% to 26% of pretax income. Moving over to balance sheet and cash flow. The financial position of HEICO and forecasted cash flow remains very strong. As we mentioned earlier, cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong and increased 32% to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, up from $81.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our working capital ratio was strong and consistent at 4.9x as of January 31, '21, and that compared to 4.8 as of October 31, '20. Days sales outstanding of receivables, DSOs, improved to 45 days as of January 31, '21, and that compared to 46 days as of January 31, '20. Of course, we continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. Our top 5 customers represented about 24% and 22% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '20, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate increased to 164 days for the period ending January 31, '21. That compared to a pre pandemic 132 days for the period ended January 31, '20. The increase in the turnover rate principally reflects lower net sales volume, mainly resulting from the pandemic impact on certain -- on demand for certain of our products and services. And despite the increased turnover rate, our subsidiaries really have done an excellent job controlling inventory levels in the first quarter of fiscal '21, which we believe are appropriate to support expected future net sales. And in consideration of HEICO's consolidated backlog, which has increased by $62 million since October 31, '20, the backlog was $906 million as of January 31, '21. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '21, the pandemic will likely continue to negatively impact commercial aerospace and HEICO. Given this uncertainty, we cannot provide fiscal '21 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing fiscal conservative policies, healthy balance sheet and increased liquidity will permit us to invest in new research and development and gain market share as the industry recovers. In addition, our time-tested strategy of maintaining low debt and acquiring and operating high cash-generating businesses across a diverse base of industries beyond commercial aviation, such as defense, space and other high-end markets, including electronics and medical, puts us in a good financial position to weather this uncertain economic period. Furthermore, we are cautiously optimistic that the vaccine progress may generate increased commercial air travel and will result in gradual recovery in demand for our commercial aerospace parts and services businesses. And we expect that to commence primarily in the second half of fiscal '21, although we do expect it to increase gradually until we get there. In closing, I again want to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO during these professionally and personally challenging times. That strength will manifest from our culture of ownership, our mutual respect for each other and the unwavering pursuit of exceeding customers' expectations. And we thank you for all you do to make HEICO an exceptional company. I also would like to point out that in spite of the pandemic and in spite of decreased sales, HEICO wanted to look and reward our team members. And again, this year, we continue to make the 5% match to team members' 401(k) investments. As you know, most team members invest 6%, HEICO matches it with 5% of their salary in HEICO shares. We would never cut that back because we respect and we want to reward our outstanding team. Thank you. And now I'd like to open the floor for any questions. Thank you. Well, we see a lot of product coming out of -- some of it coming out of private equity. So sellers are willing to sell. In the Flight Support Group, it's a little tougher because their profits have gone down, and a lot of them are pulling their sales activity hoping for recovery, which I know will be coming. However, in looking at our backlog of potential M&A possibilities, it's probably business as usual. And probably the difficulty hereof is the logistics of getting out, kicking the tires, checking and doing all these things. And that really has slowed us down a little bit, particularly when you're dealing with private equity guys. They have the information and they're more up to speed. But when you're dealing with private sellers who have never sold a company before, it becomes much more difficult. But the bottom line is we are seeing many opportunities, some at very reasonable prices. And we're kicking the tires. Others are at the 14, 16x EBITDA multiples, which price us out of the gate. And we are also looking at small companies that we traditionally buy size-wise, and we're looking at larger companies. So -- and of course, as you know, we are not physically constrained. We've been asked many times, would you use your currency, which is selling at a high multiple, for acquisition? And the answer is yes. We -- as a matter of fact, there's one transaction, I don't know if it'll ever close but -- where the seller wants HEICO shares. So our currency, we have cash. I said this on the last call, we have cash. We have stock and we have won them. So we're ready to give you -- give the sellers whatever they would like. I guess we'd give them bitcoin, too. As you know, our preference has always been to pay cash. Occasionally, we will get -- and it's very rare. We'll get somebody who prefers stock for -- probably for tax reasons, number one. And number two, because these people, well, certain ones, are really long-term believers in HEICO. So it doesn't really matter to us. If we want that acquisition and the only way we can make it is by giving stock, we would do it. And if -- as you know, we would still want to have it accretive as to earnings and cash. And it will have the same impact. I mean the alternative is we could sell stock and give them cash, but they don't want cash in this case. So again, if we want the deal badly enough, we would give them stock. But this is really an unusual case. No. No, you can't make any inferences from that at all. No. We agree with you. We think it makes a lot of sense. We have no idea -- over the years, we've been asked this question many times, and we never really have the answer. I think -- we think now, and I think I'm speaking for everybody in the corporate office, we think it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense that the difference has shrunk so much. So -- but as to what the reason is, I guess, a lot of investors realize that they're better off buying the A shares at a discount and -- than the HEI shares. But that's all I can venture. It's just a guess. Well, actually, they traded originally at a premium to HEI. Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody on the call for your interest in HEICO. As you know, we remain available, if you have questions, give us a call. Eric, Victor, Carlos or I will be happy to speak with you. And if not, we look forward to speaking to you at the Q2 conference, which will be in about 3 months. So stay well, stay healthy. Hopefully, get vaccines. And we'll speak to you real soon. Thank you all."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales were $199.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $301.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The net sales decrease is principally organic and reflects lower demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from the significant decline in global commercial air travel attributable to the pandemic. The Flight Support Group's operating income was $25.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to $62 million in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The operating income decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned decrease in net sales as well as a lower gross profit margin and the impact from lost fixed cost efficiencies stemming from the pandemic. The lower gross profit margin principally reflects the impact from lower net sales of commercial aerospace products and services across all of its product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 13.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 20.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. The operating margin decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly from the previously mentioned lost fixed cost efficiencies and the effect of higher intangible asset amortization expense. I would like to point out that the full impact of the pandemic began to affect the FSG operating segment at the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal '20. Through practical and disciplined cost management, we have delivered sequential quarterly improvements in our FSG operating margin. The FSG operating margin was just 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and has since steadily increased to 11.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and to 13% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our team members and assembled workforce is our most valuable asset. Our team members engaged primarily in commercial aviation sacrificed greatly during the pandemic through limited layoffs, moderate furloughs and wage reductions for nearly all others not impacted by layoffs or furloughs. These team members sacrificed a tremendous amount, and we owe our loyalty to them as we held on to a much higher percentage of our workforce than most others. Thus, we decided to operate with higher overhead, which reduced our gross margins and increased our SG&A. A lot of companies speak about how their team members are important. But HEICO demonstrates it through actions, including by maintaining our 401(k) matching contributions and granting our team members their maximum potential 401(k) profit sharing contributions, even though we missed our budgets due to the pandemic. We could have sacrificed the future in order to have better current period results, but that is not what HEICO is about. That's the luxury of being part of the HEICO family as we don't feel pressured to make short-term decisions that hurt future performance. We also treated our customers, suppliers, principles, partners and acquisitions extremely well and truly believe this helps us grow faster than the industry as people prefer dealing with us due to our culture. We are confident that our motivated and assembled workforce will propel us to new heights as the pandemic passes. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Rob, this is Eric. What -- we are seeing opportunity in commercial. But as my dad pointed out, the current level of earnings are depressed. So it's a little difficult to narrow down prices there, but we are still seeing plenty of opportunity. Yes. I'll answer that by saying I think we correctly called the bottom of the market in May as this was happening. And we also, in our fourth quarter, correctly called that destocking was over. And then other companies have since come out and said the same thing, but I think we were the first to talk about it. With regard to restocking, I wouldn't say that we've seen restocking so much as we've seen really depletion of inventory. And when customers order items, they need it right away. So we -- now that doesn't mean they're out of all inventory, but they're out of all parts. But the parts that they need, they really don't have on the shelf and there's not a lot of safety stock. So no, I don't think that we've seen restocking yet. I think they're being very careful. If you look, in particular, what's going on in Europe right now, with the passenger miles just cratered and really at the bottom, somewhat similar to what we saw in the spring, those airlines are not in a position right now to restock. And also, we're seeing it in a whole bunch of other markets as well. So no, I think that benefit is yet to come. And I would -- it's very hard to predict, obviously, with these variants and what's going to happen with the virus. But I don't think you're going to see a restocking until the airlines really start seeing that surge in travel, which we all know is going to come. But I think that they're going to really hold off on spending the cash until the last possible moment. Yes. We're very optimistic. Yes, I've spoken with all of our sales heads to understand where the opportunities are and the color of those discussions. And I can tell you that they are extremely optimistic as well as our business heads are very optimistic in terms of the recovery and in terms of our position with respect to those customers. HEICO is no longer a small company. We're diversified. We're in many different areas. I think our customers trust us. They're relying on us to deliver cost savings, and I think that we're going to be in a very unique position going forward. If you look at most of our colleagues or competitors in the industry, I think that their cuts were far more aggressive. I know that their cuts were far more aggressive than ours. I alluded to in my comments that we held on to a much higher percentage of our workforce and protected a much higher percentage of our workforce than both our smaller and larger competitors. So I think we are in position. We don't have to rebuild a workforce. We don't have to remotivate a workforce. And I think we're going to be very strong in mining those opportunities. I can tell you that at the moment, things are difficult. There are some airlines that are working partial days, where they've decided to also try to hang on to their workforce and they're rotating them where people work a couple of days every other week. So it's more complicated, getting in touch with people. But I think where we've got those relationships and our people are very excited about both the new product that is coming out as well as the comments that we're getting from our customers. I think after going through a pandemic like this, buying the type of products that HEICO offers is a no-brainer because we generate savings without technical risk. So I think people understand that, and that's what specifically gives me the optimism. Yes. I would say that is correct. I mean there's not a lot of new customer opportunity because we pretty much deal with everybody. However, you're correct in that the existing, I would say, more penetrated customers are wanting to do more with us as well as customers where we are less penetrated, they're very focused on a whole variety of products that we offer that we haven't sold them in the past. And I think that we will continue to do very well. And also, I want to point out that even though we will take market share, in no means should this be interpreted that OEM businesses will not do well because we take a minority of the market share, we believe the majority for the OEM. The OEMs have been pretty aggressive with price increases, and we're just trying to take our little piece, and I think their business models are very much intact. Thank you. Sure, Gautam. The -- obviously, the commercial aviation market continues to be down the most. And that would be in our parts business, which includes PMA and distribution as well as component overhaul as well as the specialty products that go to commercial applications and primarily new builds. The specialty products area has been down significantly in the commercial area. Not in the defense, but in the commercial area because as you see, the build rates have gone down. So the -- you'll see our aftermarket replacement parts was down actually a little less than repair and overhaul and specialty products. However, a lot of our military business also goes through there. So that's one of the reasons why. But I would say, in general, commercial is what was hit. Defense and space, still relatively strong, in particular, on the products that we provide. So if that gives you an indication. No. I would say it's all in the similar area. Yes. That's a good question, Ken. We are seeing some opportunities as a result of OEMs cutting back inventory. We were pretty careful to maintain in all of our businesses sufficient inventory because we're not capital constrained. And we need happy customers because we have an expansionary view of the market and our position in the market. So we want people to be very happy. And we don't deal from a view of perspective of scarcity. And we are seeing opportunities that you alluded to. I think that there are going to be pockets of opportunities. Having said that, I think the -- our competitors are -- our OEM competitors are well run, and they will be able to flex up and build the inventory that is required in order to satisfy the demand. So yes, I think it could help us get if you will, specked out on some products. So that is a potential area of opportunity for us. I don't think that, that's going to be a major impact to us. I will come out because of the unique extenuating circumstances of this and mention, of course, we do have HEICO parts on the PW4000 engine. We, of course, did not have anything on that engine which could have contributed to this kind of fan blade release. We're very knowledgeable about the incident. And it's for that reason that HEICO does not produce parts that are susceptible to this kind of issue. I think the FAA AD that they've come out with to mandate the thermal imaging of the hollow composite fan blade is sufficient and is appropriate. I would feel entirely comfortable flying on a PW4000-powered 777. I think that they're going to get this under control quickly. If you look, none of the incidents caused a crash. And so I think it shows that Pratt & Whitney did a great job and really designed a very high-quality product to be able to withstand such an event. So I do think that there will be opportunity for us to sell our parts as those engines do come in for service. As you know, roughly half of them have been grounded due to the pandemic. But I think that those are perfectly good aircraft, and Pratt is more than capable of resolving this issue. Yes. That's a great question, Mike. Yes, I think the short answer is we are well positioned on the newer equipment. I think that we're going to do very well on that. A lot of customer interest and customer approvals in those areas. In addition, also to point that, we took the position early in the pandemic that a lot of these aircraft would not be retired as some have -- as some thought for the simple reason that they already exist and the lessors and the banks that would end up having to replace them, finds a new home for them, would have two options: one is to set it up for parts; or two is to go and lease it out. And we think leasing it out makes a lot more sense when you've got life on the aircraft. So we thought that the price of -- the rental rates, it was going to fall to the point where the new build was not going to make as much sense and where that was going to have a greater impact. Now of course, the wild card is the environmental impact of new equipment. And to the extent that governments, both in the United States and Europe, help subsidize, if you will, some of the newer equipment, that could have an impact. We haven't really seen much of that. And if you look, a lot of the build rates sort of have -- they underestimated the amount of the decline, and they're taking that down. So I would say that we're a little sanguine on the new build rates. Coming back to the 2019 levels. I think that a lot of the older, still economic equipment will continue to operate. And so I think we're going to be well positioned in both the new equipment as well as the older equipment. We are. And I think a lot of the recent climb was due to the cold snap that we've had here in the United States. And that should pass, so I still think that the older equipment with its lower acquisition cost makes a lot of sense for the airlines. So I don't see them -- at this point, who wants to commit to newer equipment where you increase your cost base in the face of what we've just gone through? So I think the older equipment is going to hang in there and do well. And actually, the number of aircraft retired was even below what we thought it was going to be. And we were on the low side of the spectrum and the estimates on the retirement. I mean a lot of people spoke of big retirements, and we didn't share that view. But we're positioned well, I think, in both sides. So this is Eric. I'll go ahead and start first. With respect to the pricing umbrella, we treat our committed customers extremely well. And so we moderate price increases for them if they commit to us for a long period of time. So yes, you're absolutely right that pricing umbrella does widen over time. And we can get to a point where, if somebody has been buying a part from us for 15 to 20 years, our price could end up being 70%, 80% below the OEM price and we're still able to earn a fair margin on it and we're able to give a very good value, and then we add more products as a result of that. There's no question that we've got the opportunity if we wanted to push pricing that we could. But we've decided that the future is much greater to us and we would rather continue on our growth path and sort of limit -- voluntarily limit those opportunities in order to capture more market share. The OEMs, I would say, this year, in general, their price increase -- I mean, they've been across the board. Some have decided to raise price substantially in order to make up all of the lost margin that they've surrendered due to the pandemic. Others have been slightly more moderate in their price increases. But I would say it's pretty much across the board of business as usual. So the HEICO value has even been enhanced during the pandemic. And then for Victor? Yes. Absolutely. I think you nailed it. There may be a little bit of a recovery slightly before that as airlines get prepared, if they start to see bookings, I think that could drive it, drive an early recovery. They got to make sure that they've got the aircraft ready for, I believe, what's going to be a surge down the road. Yes. I think it's really across the board in all of our businesses. Yes, you're right that the -- first of all, the 70% to 80% price benefit would be for, as I mentioned, for a customer who's committed to us and who's been buying something for, say, 15 to 20 years. So -- and that would be the maximum. I mean that's not where we come out of the box. So if you look at repair, typically, parts as a percentage of repairs, just say, roughly 40% of the cost. So you're right that the extreme cost benefit would be more on the -- in particular, on the PMA side. But I think we're very competitive across the board in everything that we do."

Parties listening to this call are encouraged to review all of HEICO\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to the HEICO fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement teleconference. I\u2019m Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICOHEICO Corporation, and I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s flight support group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s electronic technologies group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Today my comments will address our consolidated fiscal 2022 fourth quarter results, acquisitions and accomplishments, followed by a presentation for the segment results from Eric and Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s co-Presidents.  Now before reviewing our record operating results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO\u2019s exceptional team members for delivering another strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into outstanding results for our shareholders. I\u2019m encouraged by the steady improvement in our businesses during fiscal \u201922 and I am very optimistic that this trend will continue into fiscal \u201923. Summarizing the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal \u201922 results, consolidated fourth quarter fiscal year \u201922 net sales and operating income represents record results for HEICO, and that was driven principally by record results within the flight support group mainly arising from the continued rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. In addition, this marks the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income for the flight support group.  Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 improved 27% and 20% respectively as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. These results mainly reflect 11% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the favorable impact from our fiscal \u201922 and \u201921 acquisitions.  Consolidated operating margin improved to 24% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, and that was up from 22.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. Consolidated net income increased 13% to $97.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, and that was up from $86.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921.  HEICO\u2019s effective tax rate was 23% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 as compared to 18.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The increase in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 principally reflects a 7.6% unfavorable impact from tax exempt unrealized losses in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan, and that was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 as compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized in the fourth quarter of \u201921. Later on in this call, if anyone has questions about the detail, this is a complicated matter, Carlos Macau is here and he will be able to explain that to you. Truthfully, it has no impact on our real operations. Our recent activity in acquisitions, in September \u201922 our ETG group completed the acquisition of Trad Test and Radiation located in Labege, France. Trad is a leader in the highly specialized field of radiation engineering, and their services and products are used primarily in space, nuclear and medical fields. In September \u201922, our ETG group completed the acquisition of Ironwood Electronics located in Eagan, Minnesota. Ironwood is a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance test sockets and adaptors for both engineering and production use of semiconductor devices.  As previously reported, our ETG group entered into a purchase agreement to acquire approximately 95% of Exxelia International, which is headquartered in Paris, France. Exxelia is a global leader in the design, manufacture and sale of high reliability, complex passive electronic components and rotary joint assemblies for mostly aerospace and defense applications. The transaction\u2019s closing, which remains subject to government approval and customary closing conditions, is still expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal \u201923 and would be HEICO\u2019s largest ever acquisition in terms of purchase price and revenues. These acquisitions, all of them are expected to be accretive to HEICO\u2019s earnings per share within a year of the transactions\u2019 closings.  At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s flight support group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the flight support group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much.  The flight support group\u2019s net sales increased 33% to a record $346 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, up from $260.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 reflects strong 22% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal \u201922 and \u201921 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The flight support group\u2019s operating income increased 60% to a record $77.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, up from $48.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, an improved gross profit margin mainly from increased sales within our specialty products and aftermarket replacement parts product lines, as well as efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume.  The flight support group\u2019s operating margin improved to a record 22.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, up from 18.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The operating margin increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 principally reflects decreased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. \nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies net sales increased 6% to a record $268.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, up from $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our profitable fiscal \u201922 and \u201921 acquisitions partially offset by a slight decrease in organic net sales. The organic net sales decline is mainly attributable to decreased defense and space products net sales partially offset by increased other electronics, medical and commercial aerospace products net sales.  I\u2019d like to point out that the Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s backlog remained elevated, reflecting strong orders and increasing delays in receiving components and raw materials from some suppliers. These delays have adversely impacted our planned production and shipment of some products during fiscal \u201922, but we expect that they should benefit us in fiscal \u201923 as these products ship. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income increased 4% to a record $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922, up from $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, a favorable impact from changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and decreased performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly from decreased defense and space net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 29.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201922 as compared to 30.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross margin partially offset by the previously mentioned changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense.  I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. As for the outlook, as we look ahead to fiscal \u201923, we anticipate net sales growth in both FSG and ETG principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Our largest end market is commercial aerospace, which continued to grow during fiscal \u201922, and we expect the strong growth trends to continue into fiscal \u201923.  Our second largest end market is defense. The defense markets were essentially flat for HEICO in fiscal \u201922. Though we would all prefer peace, global disputes and unrest means more defense equipment is required, providing a favorable environment for defense suppliers. We were negatively impacted by supply chain matters principally for electronic components in fiscal \u201922, and that delayed certain delivery schedules. We expect these external factors to mitigate in fiscal \u201923, but we can\u2019t predict when. However, we remain very optimistic on the defense industry\u2019s future and have seen growth in our orders and our backlog, and that supports our optimism. We will not be providing detailed fiscal \u201923 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies, strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity all enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and execute on our successful acquisition program, which collectively positions HEICO for continued growth and market share gains.  In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Fiscal \u201923 looks very promising, and I believe that our culture of ownership and entrepreneurial excellence will provide excellent career growth and opportunities for all your success in fiscal \u201923 and beyond. Thank you for all that you do to make HEICO a great company. That is the extent of our prepared remarks, and I would now like to open the line for comments and questions from people who are listening.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take the first question from Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: Hi everybody, good morning. \nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Spingarn: Nice finish to the year, very nice numbers today. You know, Larry just mentioned culture, and so I think this warrants a high-level question, for any of you. With all of the acquisitions over time for HEICO, I think many investors would have expected the company to inevitably change over time, so can you talk about how you\u2019ve been able to maintain the culture and the operational excellence, and essentially, what drives the consistency in the outperformance?\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, Eric is dying to answer that question, but since you posed it to me, I will respond. I don\u2019t want to duck anybody\u2019s question, Rob. The basic culture of HEICO is one of a decentralized organization where we give tremendous authority to the operating level. As you know, we have no mid-level vice presidents that filter everything that comes from the operating group up to corporate and to myself, Eric, Victor and Carlos.  The first thing we do in acquisition, the most important is really scrutinize, analyze, get to know the person who is selling the company to us and how he manages. If he treats his people well - this is very important - as an example, if he goes through the factory and he sees somebody and he tell us, oh, that\u2019s a machine operator, that\u2019s a this and that, that\u2019s not very impressive, but some of these people go through the factory and they say--they stop at a machine and say, Charlie here, these are the Mendelsons, how is Anne, meaning his wife, family okay, everything good, Charlie, how long have you been working for, 22 years. This means an awful lot, Rob. We understand the relationship between the owner of the company and his workforce, his team members. That goes a long way and we understand how that all works, and that\u2019s the HEICO culture. The other thing is we give tremendous authority and responsibility to the operating person. We believe that the person running his organization knows more about his team members, his labor force, his customers, his manufacturers, everything else, than somebody in a corporate office a thousand or two thousand miles away. Again, it\u2019s the authority that we give them, and people who are very talented respect the fact that we give them that authority. Talented people normally do not like somebody breathing down their neck and over-supervising them - what are you doing, what are you doing, so I think that has worked very well. Also, we have a very exceptional 401-K plan where we give employees, if they put in 6%, we match it normally with 5% in HEICO stock. Many, many of our working people - I\u2019m talking about factory workers, shipping clerks, secretarial help are millionaires, some multi-millionaires all as a result of the stock that\u2019s HEICO\u2019s given them. They take a personal pride in being a HEICO team member. It\u2019s not as though, hey, I\u2019m working and I hate my job. They understand that they are being compensated and rewarded by having shares of HEICO stock given to them by the company, they didn\u2019t pay for it, so that brings their interest aligned with all shareholders.  We think that most of our people are focused on building HEICO and being part of a team. There\u2019s a psychological benefit to call somebody a team member as opposed to an employee. If you\u2019re my employee, you work for me; if you are a team member, we all work together, so all of these things are what we call part of the HEICO culture, and I think a lot of that is responsible for our success. Eric, do you want to add?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I mean, I think that\u2019s a good explanation of our acquisitions and our culture, but I think Rob, as I was thinking about this, I think it\u2019s even more basic than that. It\u2019s that when we came to this company 33 years ago, we decided we wanted to build something for the long term, and it wasn\u2019t going to be built for years or a single decade, it was going to be built for multiple decades. Frankly, every single thing that we\u2019ve done and every decision that we take has been designed to drive sustained, long-term growth of the business as opposed to any short-term focus. When we\u2019ve got to make decisions on everything from inventory, capital expenditures, people, customer relationships, everything is focused on cash generation as a result of also maintaining low debt and being able to create a culture which drives long term performance. As a matter of fact, last night I was reviewing some of our capital expenditure plans and I saw some of our subsidiaries were buying equipment that, frankly, wasn\u2019t going to impact \u201923 or fiscal \u201924 earnings, but was going to impact it in \u201925, \u201926, \u201927 and after, and I realized that the results that we are showing today, which are frankly, I think, so far above what\u2019s normal for the industry, are as a result of that long term focus, and we\u2019re really benefiting as a result of decisions that were made 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, that you can\u2019t make happen short term. People ask me all the time, why is it HEICO performs? If you look at over the length of the economic cycle, we don\u2019t have one-time write-offs, we don\u2019t do things that, if you will, goose the earnings in the short term, and I think our culture, which has been designed for a long-term approach, is very, very different than typical corporate culture or private equity, which obviously has--you know, which drives short term results as a result of their compensation structure and everything that they\u2019re set out to be.  I really want to call out the people at HEICO because, frankly, the ones who get ahead and the ones who are in positions running our businesses today, are in positions of importance, are frankly the steady Eddies. They\u2019re not the ones who came in and all of a sudden had a quick turnaround and a great success, a flash in the pan. Our people have worked hard year in, year out, most over decades, and it\u2019s a result of that performance and that discipline and that rigor over decades which has driven the results that we have today.  I just want to call out, frankly, all of our incredible people, our steady Eddies who just continue to work hard year after year and really make this happen. I think that\u2019s really what makes us unique. \nRob Spingarn: Thanks very much for the comprehensive answer, appreciate that.\nEric Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Solow at CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLarry Solow: Great, good morning. Thanks guys. Larry, I can totally appreciate on the guidance. You guys have a long successful history, don\u2019t necessarily need to provide [indiscernible] guidance anyhow, so, but I do appreciate the sort of qualitative outlook. Just maybe a couple questions for Eric and Victor. Eric, obviously it feels like your aftermarket is strong, parts are strong I\u2019m sure, specialty I think also had a good quarter this quarter, but I\u2019m just trying to figure out, you had a little bit of an above-average margin year this year. Some of those drivers, has that sort of settled back into more of a historical range as we look out to the coming year?\nCarlos Macau: Hey Larry, this is Carlos. Let me jump in there. I think what we\u2019re seeing in the flight support group, and it\u2019s been amplified, let\u2019s say starting in Q2 and running through the end of the year, is some disproportionate growth in specialty products, which has change the mix a little bit in FSG for the back half of this year, which normally isn\u2019t the case. Normally, all aspects of the flight support group grow in tandem, and usually our story is a margin that\u2019s based off volume growth.  I think what we continue to see is our parts and specialty products outperforming some of the businesses within the flight support group, which has--because of mix has had an impact on--pulling the margin up a little bit. We\u2019re happy to see that. As Eric mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a 22.5% margin for the quarter, all-time record. We\u2019re very happy to see that, but I think once the mix settles back into its footprint, once we get completely out of COVID, we\u2019ll see that margin moderate a little bit, would be my expectation.\nLarry Solow: Okay, yes, that makes sense. I just--yes?\nEric Mendelson: And Larry, also just to add, I think we did--you know, we have seen market share increases and, frankly, tremendous efficiency as a result of the effort of our people, but I also want to add that the margin that we have was--you know, we were still able to drive that margin, even having proper reserves, paying people frankly generous bonuses, and we did everything for the long term and still came out with those margins. We made all of our investments and did everything the right way, and I just couldn\u2019t be more pleased with those margins. \nLarry Solow: Absolutely, and from a high level, Eric, obviously, it feels like commercial aviation seems to be in a good place right now. The economy may be slowing a little bit, or for sure it\u2019s slowing. I just assume it feels like you\u2019re going to have a good growth year again, but obviously you can\u2019t continue to grow like you did the last couple years, but just any color on how you feel that the industry is today?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I feel very, very good about HEICO\u2019s position in the industry. There\u2019s no question that a rising tide lifts all boats, but I think that HEICO is in, frankly, a unique position because we\u2019ve positioned ourselves in our various businesses and I\u2019ve seen in all of those businesses substantial margin increase, as well as market share increase. We\u2019re doing really well. I mean, as a matter of fact, and normally I wouldn\u2019t call it out but just so you\u2019re getting to this, what\u2019s interesting is that our PMA sales are at an all-time record, and if you look, flights across the world are still down whatever - 20%, and we still haven\u2019t seen full recovery in Asia and somewhat in Europe and Middle East and South America, and even in the U.S. to a lesser extent, North America. But HEICO PMA sales are at an all-time record, so I think that we\u2019ve got plenty of power behind us and I think that\u2019s as a result of picking up market share and, frankly, treating the customers right. They know that we\u2019ve treated them right for 30 years and we don\u2019t take advantage of them, and we\u2019re very fair, we\u2019re very reasonable, and they\u2019ve rewarded us with that market share. It wasn\u2019t stuff that we did short term that made it happen, it was stuff that we did long term and they trust us. I think we\u2019re really very much in a virtuous cycle which is permitting this. \nLarry Solow: Absolutely, great. Then if I can maybe just switch gears real quick, one more quickie for Victor - I know you\u2019ve been quiet back there. Just quickly, obviously it sounds like your largest market, defense, the macro is very favorable and maybe this year was impacted by some worse supply chain issues than anything else. How about some of your other larger markets - space, medical? It feels like the outlook there, [indiscernible] industrial, all consistently good. Is that sort of a fair assessment?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I mean, good questions Larry. Those other markets have been very strong for us this year, and in fact I think really toward the end of last year as well. They\u2019ve really been star performers, all the ones you mentioned - medical, high-end electronics in particular, space a little--commercial space a little--you know, certainly less so and actually a little softer in some instances.  I would expect, by the way, going forward, you\u2019ve heard me say this before that at some point, we see those other markets flatten out somewhat, and--still I think excellent markets for us, but I would expect them to flatten out or even soften up a little bit as the year wears on and as supply chains get worked out and customers deal with their own channels.\nLarry Solow: Got it, great. I appreciate that color. Thanks guys.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, everyone. \nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Pete.\nPete Skibitski: I guess Victor, maybe just to continue that discussion a little bit, it looks like we might get sort of high single digit budget growth this year in the base DoD budgets, and a lot of Ukraine-related spending as well. Can you give us some puts and takes in terms of, you know, if we look at that budget growth but also consider--you know, you\u2019ve talked about the supply chain issues and some people talk about defense contracting officer kind of delays, what\u2019s the right way to think about all those puts and takes and the expectation I think we would all have, that you could at least grow at least in line with DoD budget growth, at least averaging it over time?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I certainly think over time we should exceed DoD budget growth, just knowing our businesses and what we\u2019re working on and the things that we do. But of course, in any given period, we may be tied to the defense budget directly or it could be negative, right--our correlation would be a negative one to the defense budget. I would think that you\u2019re absolutely right on some of the procurement specialists at the DoD being, let\u2019s say, overwhelmed in their workloads and dealing with work-from-home conditions and things like that, which have definitely in our view delayed deferred items from getting put under contract. The supply chain issues, I think have been bigger for us, and I think they were kind of record level for us in the fourth quarter. I was hoping that they would come off in the fourth quarter, maybe we\u2019re starting to see a little bit--seeing some green shoots in the supply chain, but I think it\u2019s too early to call victory there.  Then of course, you mentioned the foreign engagements, which I think benefit us. I don\u2019t think that they are going to cause--you know, be major needle movers necessarily in the next quarter or two. I think actually if you look at what we make and how those things are getting inserted over there, I think they\u2019re a little longer burn in terms of just the order cycle and production cycle, but I think as we said in the comments that the dynamic is positive for us.\nPete Skibitski: Okay, appreciate it. Maybe last one from me, for Carlos maybe. Carlos, I think this year was a year of building some safety stocks, and if we expect revenue up next year, how do you think working capital trends--does the safety stock issue kind of reverse itself or do we continue to build because of these supply chain issues and higher growth? Just was wondering if you could provide some color there. Thanks guys.\nCarlos Macau: Sure, so we invested--I mean, HEICO, we invested in inventory this year. If you look at our balance sheet, you\u2019ll notice that we have a pretty big investment in working capital, particularly for inventory, so I suspect that, as you\u2019re pointing out, a lot of companies around the world have done that also.  The impact to us going into next year, I don\u2019t think there is a ton of impact on the flight support side because most of the business that we do in the flight support group is ordered and shipped in the same month, there\u2019s not a ton of backlog. Within our defense business on specialty products, there\u2019s backlog, but most of the aftermarket is really built and shipped in the same month, which implies that most of our customers aren\u2019t stocking our product. We have a model with our customers where the parts come when they need it, and they don\u2019t have to stock our stuff if they don\u2019t want to; in fact, if they do want that, we usually put consignment cages in their buildings and we handle all that for them, so not too much on the flight support side. In ETG, I do think that it has been in vogue, particularly with electronic parts, to go heavy on inventory - we\u2019ve done that, and yes, I think in \u201923, could there be some sort of inflection where people hit the pause button? That\u2019s possible I think for our businesses, because we\u2019re not stuffing channels and over-supplying our customers, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to be a major impact to HEICO, but I think globally there\u2019s something out there that we\u2019ll reckon with probably in \u201923 or early \u201924.\nPete Skibitski: Okay, thanks guys.\nCarlos Macau: Does that answer your question? All right, Pete, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Arnett with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arnett: Yes, good morning, Larry, Victor, Eric, Carlos. Happy holidays.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Arnett: Hey Victor, last quarter you kind of quantified the supply chain push-out - I think it was around $25 million of sales. You just mentioned it was kind of at record levels, so exceeding that number, or maybe if you could just give us a little--if you can quantify it, that\u2019d be helpful.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, sure. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, that number actually rose by a little more than $20 million to around $47 million. Now, I won\u2019t identify which subsidiary. About half of it actually came in one subsidiary, and so--which had not been experiencing, actually had avoided the supply chain issues for quite a long time. They\u2019re estimating they will ship that in fiscal \u201923. In some ways, there was some improvement over the prior period because a number of other companies saw their numbers shrink, but we had one in particular that was high and then a couple of others that were on the higher side, too, whereas in the past it\u2019d been a little more broadly distributed.\nPeter Arnett: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then Carlos, maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about tax rate expectations when we\u2019re thinking about fiscal \u201923.\nCarlos Macau: I think for HEICO, we typically run 20%, 21%, sometimes better than that. This year, our tax rate was amplified for pretty much most of the year except Q1 due to losses in the market, and as Larry mentioned earlier in the call, we have investments in life insurance policies which back what\u2019s called our leadership compensation plan, which is a deferred comp plan for our employees, our team members. When the losses on cash surrender value occur, which is impacted by general market trends, we don\u2019t recognize a loss on the P&L but what we do recognize is either gains or losses in our tax rate, as a result movement in those permanently deferred items, and so that can have a material impact on our tax rate. This year, it had about a $25 million impact on our tax rate and so that is not insignificant. That is the driver of what could move our rate off that 20% bogey that I would normally target, so if the markets grow, our tax rate will be a little lower. If the markets stay stable, you\u2019ll see our tax rate similar to what we had this year, and if we have big losses next year in the market overall, it could amplify our tax rate a point or two. \nPeter Arnett: Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. Just lastly from me, Eric, you mentioned you\u2019ve got record levels of PMA, but we still have a lot of traffic down in Asia. I was just wondering how you quantify when we see--you know, if China reopens fully, what the impact could be on FSG. I know you\u2019re kind of already a global player in terms of your customer base.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I mean, we\u2019re already doing very well in China, and if China presumably--I mean, my expectation, speaking with various experts, is that China is going to experience hundreds of millions of cases of COVID. Whether they get reported or not is another thing. That should have a chilling effect on their domestic travel. The real question is whether that spreads. Based on the vaccination rates and therapeutics that are available around the world and our natural immunities as a result of everybody else getting infected, hopefully it doesn\u2019t impact the rest of the world, but I think China, we\u2019re going to see fits and starts. The air travel went up a lot a couple days ago and now it\u2019s come down. They\u2019re going to be in for a tough 12 months, I think, as a result of where they are with the virus. But we feel very strongly, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re wired to continue to take market share, and I think we\u2019re in a very strong position to do well regardless of how China does, but we are doing very well in China currently.\nPeter Arnett: Appreciate all the details. Thanks guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Deuschle: Victor, just following up on Pete\u2019s question, could you talk a bit more about supply chain trends at ETG? I know you mentioned that some things have gotten worse this quarter, but you also talked about seeing some green shoots, so maybe just spend a minute talking about some of the details behind that, so what got worse and what the green shoots have been. Thank you.\nVictor Mendelson: This is Victor. The answer is it\u2019s particularly on the components side. I mean, we\u2019re finding and a lot of our companies have been finding that FPGAs, for example - field programmable gate arrays are slow to come in, they\u2019re behind in delivery schedules. We have some other very complex microwave components that are designed specifically for some of the products we make, and there are only a few vendors for those in the world and they are well behind schedule. We\u2019ve also seen some lead times pull out--push out for, I won\u2019t go into which subsidiaries, but some polymer-related products that are used in some of the things that we make, so that has been--I guess that\u2019s been where it\u2019s extended out. Where it\u2019s been better has been on some of the lower cost and more common electronic components that are used in circuit boards and other things that we make, as well as for some silicones and products, interestingly enough some polymer-related products, so it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. \nScott Deuschle: Okay, that\u2019s super helpful, thank you. Carlos, is 1.5% of sales still the right way to think about capex for next year?\nCarlos Macau: I think so. We\u2019re probably targeting somewhere around $40 million next year in capex roughly, so that\u2019s about what your math should produce.\nScott Deuschle: Okay, and then last question for you, just as we incorporate Exxelia into the models, anything important to reflect on in terms of cadence there? Is there seasonality to that business, more Q4-weighted, anything like that that we should be mindful of? Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. I mean, look - Exxelia, I\u2019ve often said that it almost mirrors--it\u2019s like a mini ETG. It\u2019s got very similar business strategy and markets, so I think as the electronic technology group flexes throughout the year, I think you\u2019ll see Exxelia perform the same way. The only caveat to that is they are a European-based company, so there can be external factors in Europe that would impact them that wouldn\u2019t impact us here in the States, but those macro things we can\u2019t control, so that will be well known as you read the paper. But no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any--there\u2019s nothing on the table that would cause that business to perform much differently than the overall ETG. \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Hi, good morning. Thank you, and nice quarter.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nKen Herbert: Maybe Eric, I wanted to start off--I wanted to see within FSG, if you\u2019re seeing anything yet that may lead you to believe that there is some potential slowdown or recession risk amongst your airline customers. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing anything yet in terms of delayed maintenance spending, downward revisions on work scopes, inventory adjustments, anything like that, and if you think about a potential recession risk, for instance here in the United States, how would that flow through your business? Which parts would be initially hit, and how should we think about the impact or potential impact of that on the segment?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, good question Ken. To start out, no, we have not seen any change in order patterns from our customers as a result of the most recent economic data. Things are continuing to be extremely strong, and as a matter of fact, we just keep on hitting new highs. However, we all know that if a recession comes and air travel is curtailed, there will ultimately be an impact. Now, I think the impact on air travel could be a little less perhaps than it\u2019s been in other periods, only because we were sort of starved for air travel for about two years, so that may mitigate a little bit of it. But certainly, the industry will be impacted, and clearly you could see it in cargo load factors and dedicated cargo aircraft flying, that those would definitely be curtailed. But I would anticipate that as far as HEICO goes, we\u2019re in a unique position, I believe because of the products that we\u2019ve developed. Although I don\u2019t want to cite on this call what they are, I can tell you that a large part of our rebound has been new products that, frankly, hadn\u2019t been sold pre-COVID, and a large part of that is new products that we didn\u2019t even offer pre-COVID. I think that we\u2019re in a unique position to be able to mitigate that, and that is why our PMA results are at a record whereas the industry is--you know, the number of flights is still down 20%, so that would imply upside to us. I think one of the things, though, that you also have to consider is--and historically you\u2019ve asked the question about destocking and restocking and all that, there\u2019s no question it would be normal behavior in a time of shortage to over-buy, and I think that all recoveries do hit a period of over-buying, the question is when that occurs. Nobody tells you, hey, I\u2019ve ordered 100 parts but I really only need 80 of them right now, and the extra 20 are for the shelf, because they want to get those 20 on the shelf because they\u2019re afraid they can\u2019t get them. I think that\u2019s a natural risk for the industry, but I think HEICO\u2019s got the ability to mitigate. Clearly parts and repair would be impacted first and then ultimately new aircraft build rates would be impacted second, if that answers your question.\nKen Herbert: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.  Just as a follow-up, maybe for Eric or for Carlos, the incremental margins in the fourth quarter of \u201922 were sequentially the strongest we\u2019ve seen all this year within the FSG segment - you know, mid 40s. How should we think about--it sounded like maybe some moderation on margins from mix in \u201923 could potentially be a scenario, but how should we think about incremental margins as we think about \u201923, based on the comments you just had and what you\u2019re seeing today?\nCarlos Macau: Hey Ken, I would--you know, in a normal run for HEICO, as I\u2019ve talked about in the past, you should expect the fixed cost at around 15% plus our normal margin, so that would put us around 35% or 36%. That would be a normal run on growth. That can vacillate depending on events in a quarter and what\u2019s happening, but once we settle into our footprint, once all the businesses have kind of settled down and they\u2019re growing in tandem again, I think that that\u2019s what you should expect. Hopefully as we get into \u201923, that will be what I would expect to see.\nKen Herbert: Great, all right, well I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys, thank you for the time. I wanted to start off, I think it was Peter\u2019s question, Eric, that question to you on FSG and your thoughts on the recovery in China. You said you were doing really well in China. How much of your FSG business has recovered in China, and of your 35% of sales of international, how do we think about that split between FSG and ETG, and geographically?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, good questions. Our sales into China in the flight support group are at an all-time record. We\u2019re frankly well ahead of our 2019 numbers, so we\u2019re doing very well there. I think there is obviously upside from here. I remember--I think it was about a year ago or so, and you asked me did I think by the end of \u201922, narrow body in the U.S., would it be recovered, and I said I didn\u2019t know and I thought it would be hard. But in fact, not only did narrow body U.S. recover but, frankly, the whole world overall recovered for us.  I think we\u2019re in a very good position in all of our markets. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what\u2019s going to happen, to sort of lay out the next 12 months over in China. I think it\u2019s going to be fits and starts. I like reading your weekly report on number of flights, and that\u2019s got a lot of great data in it, but I think we\u2019re well positioned there to grow our market share and we\u2019re gaining market share all the time in China. \nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure, and thank you so much for that shout-out.  In terms of--Victor, you\u2019ve been very busy yourself, and I know people have skirted around margins at ETG a little bit, but they were very strong to end the year. How do we think about that going forward, and I think Exxelia is 150 basis points dilutive to 2023 margins, how do we think about that long term opportunity?\nVictor Mendelson: Well, a couple things. Exxelia does carry a lower margin than the ETG average. We haven\u2019t said what that is, so I can\u2019t comment on what it might be, but without Exxelia, excluding Exxelia when I look at--and I think you\u2019ve heard me say this before, that I think we\u2019re within a couple of points on what I call the real operating margin, right, which is--you can sort of think of as a cash flow margin before intangibles amortization but after depreciation. I think that somewhere within a point or two of 30%, either up or down on that, is the right level - I think I\u2019ve been pretty consistent on it, and Exxelia of course will change that somewhat. I continue to believe that\u2019s the case. There are always headwinds and tailwinds, and as you\u2019ve heard me say before, I don\u2019t really come down with a club on people, the people running our businesses, if they\u2019re giving us a 31% margin instead of 32% or a 28% instead of 30%, or a 29%, et cetera. I look at it on a gross basis, an overall basis, so I think our margins should remain healthy and we\u2019ll continue to be pretty proud of them. \nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great, thank you so much.\nVictor Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice results. Thanks for taking the question here. I guess Carlos, maybe to dig in, I know you\u2019re not giving the detailed guidance, but you do have that one liner in the press release where you called out potentially higher material and labor costs, so how should we think about that into \u201923? Obviously, we already covered the FSG margins, they may normalize. It sounds like ETG - you know, pre-Exxelia could pick up.  Then I guess just on the revenue side as well, do we expect the normal FSG seasonality, or are we still in the recovery mode here from COVID?\nCarlos Macau: I think the way to answer that question is we aren\u2019t giving guidance, but we do expect the company to perform, let\u2019s say better than the industry, just like our history has been. We do expect growth in our sales. I think the stated goal of the company every year when we come out of the box is to grow the bottom line 15% to 20%, and that will be our management team\u2019s goal for the year. We\u2019ve done it pretty consistently for 33 years, and you can see this year we grew 16% on the bottom line, so I think you could reverse engineer it.  If you\u2019re thinking about how to get the pieces of that pie, just reverse engineer up from that 15% to 20% bottom line expectation and come up with your numbers, but we\u2019re not going to give detailed guidance at this time.\nMichael Ciarmoli: That\u2019s fair. The only other one I had, it kind of relates to guidance, but if we look at ETG, should we expect a pick-up of that $47 million - I mean, that would give you almost five points of growth there, and then think about just kind of a normal potential organic recovery, supply chain easing, because it seems like you\u2019re going to have--you\u2019re going to be off to a good start in ETG if you pick up the lost sales from \u201922 here.\nCarlos Macau: Well, we don\u2019t know, Michael, when the disruptions from the supply chain fully bleed out, right, so we could have more pushes. But what I will say is that we did have a down year in defense which was in total greater than that $47 million you\u2019re referring to, so I think what our expectations are is that as we get into \u201923, we do expect the overall defense market to improve, at least as it relates to HEICO, and that should be a nice little tailwind for ETG going into \u201923.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it, perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.\nCarlos Macau: All right, thank you Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning. \nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: Just as demand grows for HEICO\u2019s PMAs, and I think you\u2019re developing around 400 parts per year, one, what is the duration of the PMA approval process with the FAA look like at this point? Is it getting better? I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the work-from-home dynamic. But then two, how are you looking at the PMA opportunity set? Are you looking to move up the value chain at all?\nEric Mendelson: Hi Josh, this is Eric. With regard to the FAA, our cycle time is great, it\u2019s outstanding, so that doesn\u2019t hold us up at all. With regard to the value set, we continue to go after parts similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past, as well as what I\u2019ll call adjacent white spaces, so we continue to really grow the product portfolio. We\u2019ve got the largest portfolio in the industry by far, and we\u2019re very well diversified across a very, very wide group, so I think we\u2019re going to continue to grow. Our customers are asking us to go into more spaces, so we\u2019re continuing to do that. You know, we\u2019ve treated them very well over the decades and we\u2019ve been very reasonable with regards to pricing, and they greatly appreciate that, so they\u2019ve been encouraging us and rewarding us with, frankly, much more business, so I think we\u2019re in a unique position there to continue to grow market share.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then maybe just moving over to the space exposure, there\u2019s been a number of M&A transactions in the market on new programs evolving. How are you looking at the space market and that balance between legacy programs versus gaining some exposure to these growth programs that are ramping up in areas like LEO and the lunar markets?\nVictor Mendelson: Thanks, this is Victor. We\u2019re looking at that very carefully, as always. There is opportunity in the LEO market for us. We\u2019ve been doing business in the LEO market very strongly and successfully for a long time, and of course we still think there\u2019s some good opportunity in the GEO market and even smaller satellites now in the GEO market. But we are very careful to avoid some of the more experimental, if you will, parts of the satellite business where we would be more of a financial risk partner, where we\u2019re concerned about margins, pricing, stability, reliability and so on. We haven\u2019t taken the bait to go out and buy -- I can\u2019t count the number of exciting space companies that we hear about, we get a deal book or a teaser on, and it\u2019s just, pun intended, straight to the moon. We\u2019ve really been resistant to those opportunities because we also know that they\u2019re highly speculative, so we\u2019re going to proceed but proceed carefully. We want to be of very good value to our customers and the ones we have been serving historically, as well as a number of the new ones who we think are serious about buying our products long term.\nJosh Sullivan: Great, thank you for the time.\nVictor Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna : Hey, good morning. Happy holidays guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Sorry, I joined a little late, so I was wondering at ETG, did you guys describe the changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration? I was just curious like how big that was and what that related to?\nCarlos Macau: Sure. This is Carlos. We use contingent earn-outs to bridge deal value gaps when we\u2019re dealing with sellers. Right now, on the balance sheet, we have roughly $85 million in contingent earn-out obligations, fair value of $85 million. What winds up happening, Gautam, is a couple things: one, you have to evaluate performance of each of the units and re-compute, if you would, what that earn-out may be. But what really impacted us this fiscal year, fourth quarter end throughout the year, was the interest rates going up, because you have to fair value those liabilities, and as the rates go up, those liabilities shrink, right, so we did have some noise throughout the year for these earn-outs. In particular, we had maybe $2 million or something run through the numbers for the fourth quarter as credits to expense to reduce that liability as a result of the Fed\u2019s moving the interest rate, and ultimately what that does to longer term or intermediate term risk-free rates. \nGautam Khanna: Got it, okay. That\u2019s very helpful.  I was curious, you know, a couple quarters ago I think specialized products started to come back within flight support, and if you could just talk a little bit about how that\u2019s trending and if there\u2019s any discernible difference on the defense piece of that, versus the defense piece of ETG in terms of supply chain or just demand trends.\nEric Mendelson: This is Eric. With regard to specialty products, we\u2019re doing very well. In particular, we also have a lot of exposure to, frankly, to missile defense, and we\u2019re doing particularly well in that area, but as well as commercial aviation. Again, we\u2019ve got a unique value proposition in those businesses and I think they\u2019re going to continue to grow and gain market share over time, especially as the aircraft--the commercial aircraft build rates increase.\nGautam Khanna: Okay, and just one last one for me, maybe Victor on ETG, broadly speaking what is your visibility on the defense and space side? I\u2019m just curious, like how far out do you have orders through, and how has that changed maybe over the last year?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. Right now, the backlog for ETG is fairly typical. It\u2019s a record backlog, by the way, and we\u2019ve had record backlog throughout the year, in fact I was looking at every month through the year with the exception of one, we had record backlog, so as a percent of revenue, it seems to be very strong. We have some additional visibility into future shipments, in part because of those supply chain issues, right - that\u2019s a little bit of it, although that is a pretty small fraction, actually, overall, the slippage of our backlog.  And in terms of defense outlook, I would generally say we are not short lead time on our products, and so it\u2019s at least kind of a good flavor for the next six months at any given moment, typically, and then sort of it starts to deteriorate from there, which is our typical situation. I would say we\u2019re probably in a fairly typical situation now.\nGautam Khanna: Great, thanks a lot, guys. \nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Good morning, guys. \nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Louis.\nLouis Raffetto: Larry, I think you haven\u2019t had the opportunity, so I guess let\u2019s get your take on the M&A marketplace right now. I\u2019ve kind of heard some mixed things recently. Obviously, you guys have been busy this past year, but what are you seeing out there right now?\nLaurans Mendelson: I think I would say it\u2019s normal. We\u2019re spending a lot of time trying to work with the Exxelia closing, but we are looking for--at a number of acquisitions in both areas, in ETG and in-flight support. The market is a little strange now because sellers want high prices that they saw with low interest rates, and buyers, particularly private equity, is having more of a struggle raising money, so I think I would expect to see prices coming down as long as interest rates are up.  We are very disciplined buyers, as you know, and I think--I\u2019m hopeful that we will see some good opportunities. We\u2019re looking at many now. Some of the things that we\u2019re rejected, honestly, recently we\u2019ve seen some companies and they were overpriced, well overpriced, and we made offers and those offers were not accepted, but the deals didn\u2019t go either, so the people didn\u2019t sell the company. We have to see what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re not going to change our discipline, and as you know, we look for strong cash flow and we want to see our money back, our investment in somewhere between 7 to 11 years, and when you pay 16 times EBITDA, you can\u2019t do it, so we\u2019re not playing in that market - we never did, we never will.  I think overall I\u2019m optimistic that we will make our fair share of investments. This past year, we concluded how many, Carlos - six?\nCarlos Macau: It was eight deals.\nLaurans Mendelson: Eight deals, you know, so that\u2019s enough in a year, eight transactions. Deals, we are opportunistic, we don\u2019t force deals. When deals are priced properly, when we have the right type of company, that\u2019s what we will move on it. I hope that answers your question.\nLouis Raffetto: No, that\u2019s great color, thank you. Carlos, maybe just one, I understand no guidance, but what is the acquired sales growth based on deals that closed so far look like for FY23? Is it $150 million, or whereabouts?\nCarlos Macau: Are you talking about acquired for next year?\nLouis Raffetto: Yes, exactly.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, I think it will be between 100 and 150. I know that\u2019s a wide range, but that\u2019s about what it\u2019s going to look like.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: Sure.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: As a reminder, it\u2019s star, one to ask a question. We\u2019ll take our next question from Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Please go ahead.\nColin Ducharme: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for the question and the time. I had a couple, maybe I\u2019ll just throw them out in the table all at once here. Carlos, wondered if you could just speak briefly to--just comment on wage pressure and inflation, what you\u2019re feeling now and what you\u2019re hearing from the subsidiaries particularly as you roll forward into 2023, and also talk about the capex, a little muted actually from what I may have expected this past year. You mentioned the step-up as we look forward 12 months. Can you just talk a little bit more about where that money is going? Then maybe for Eric, you addressed the how in terms of margin expansion with FSG. You talked about specialty strength. Can you talk a little bit about the why - you know, not in tandem demand in terms of the different components moving together, but why are customers in particular kind of pulling through specialty here? Then maybe I\u2019ll pause there, and I\u2019ve got one or two follow-ups for Larry, thanks.\nCarlos Macau: Colin, I\u2019ll hit your first two questions and then hand it to Eric. On the wage and labor front, we\u2019re highly sensitive to that. We watch it very closely. Because we are spread out, really, all over the country and all over the world, there are different dynamics in each market. The best way that we have found to deal with those dynamics is to allow our folks in the field, the general managers running our businesses to deal with their local marketplace, to deal with the wage pressures and material pressures on the raw material side. We\u2019ve also told them that as it relates to pricing, to try to work with our customers to protect our margins. Our objective is to not be those guys - you know, we don\u2019t want to be the guys that are known as jacking prices indiscriminately. We want to get paid fairly for what we do, and of course if our input costs do go up, we are asking our customers to help us out in that regard to protect our margins and so far, knock on wood, that strategy has worked very well for us. On the capex side, I did discuss around a $40 million number for next year. This year was a little light in aggregate dollars. It wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t buy what we needed. I feel like it\u2019s a broken record, but it\u2019s because our folks are frugal, and if they need a million dollar brand-new machine, our guys will put that in as a capex request and then they\u2019ll go out and spend $80,000 on a used piece of equipment, drop another $10,000 into it to refurbish it and use that machine for the next decade. That\u2019s generally what I\u2019m dealing with. Our capex budgets, while I\u2019d give you that $40 million number for next year, not including Exxelia by the way, that\u2019s just our core businesses of today, there is a high probability, like in the past, that we under-spend that, but it will not be because our folks didn\u2019t get exactly what they need to conduct business and plan for the future.  Does that answer your question, Colin?\nColin Ducharme: Helpful, thank you. Yes.\nEric Mendelson: And Colin, you asked why - you know, why we have these results in terms of the sales and the earnings, and I really do believe it starts with our low debt decentralized culture. That permits us to make decisions well in advance and always keep our eye on the long term. When you do that, people are then able to spend their energy on creating true economic value. When you look at the crisis that we just went through, we had plenty of inventory, we continued to develop parts, we continued to treat our customers extremely well as a result of that and, frankly, treat our team members very well because they were critical to our business. I think that is the reason why HEICO continues to outperform, and it\u2019s not just in parts and repair but it\u2019s also in the specialty products business.  There are all sorts of cases that I can give you where we can significantly jack price on customers and we don\u2019t do it. We don\u2019t do it because we want to make sure that we retain that business for the long haul. In the short term, people can play all sorts of games with regard to pricing, inventory, all sorts of metrics that you see in the short term; but in the long term, you can\u2019t get away with that, and if we want to build this market share like we\u2019re doing, the only way to do it is to build the long term and to really have that level of trust, and frankly that\u2019s how we incentivize our people. Victor and I each have a whole bunch of businesses that we go and we visit, we know the people not only running them but we know the people in charge of the different departments, all the way down very often to people on the shop floor. We understand who has a long-term culture and who fits with the way we do things and who just plays games, so that\u2019s honestly the why in why this happens. This management team has been here for 33 years - I can\u2019t think of many management teams, and I certainly can\u2019t think of any off the tip of my tongue, that have been there for 33 years and plan on being there decades longer, so.\nColin Ducharme: Okay, helpful. I appreciate the comments.  Maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Eric there, just in terms of maybe digging into the why. The role of value-added distribution, I mean, you\u2019ve got smaller private peers that have made distribution in particular central to their business strategy, and you guys yourselves did several quarters ago a string of deals which added--bolstered your muscle, as it were, in this particular area. Typically, you\u2019ve got some quasi-exclusive relationships that go along with those types of segments and businesses, and I\u2019m trying to link back to your comments on today\u2019s call on wallet share expansion, and I\u2019m wondering what, if any, critical role value-added distribution in the deals you\u2019ve done in prior quarters are playing today with the wallet share gains that we\u2019re now seeing from you guys, versus other factors like the price umbrella with OEMs, et cetera. Maybe to round out, a final question for Larry, is just Exxelia has a--you know, great deal here, largest ever, has the potential to be a buy-and-build on that continent for you all. Can you just speak to your--the relative maturity of your deal flow model on that continent, meaning are you satisfied with the width of your M&A funnel there? Is it as wide and mature as we perceive the U.S. and North American M&A funnel to be for you all? Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Colin, this is Eric. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question that you asked me - you know, the why on the distribution. Our distribution companies are, in my opinion, the single most successful distribution companies in the industry. They started out as small entrepreneurial companies and they continue to run that way. They\u2019ve got the financial muscle of HEICO behind them so we\u2019re able to buy inventory that makes sense, but we also are very, very realistic on the value of the inventory and the value that we bring to the table. You know, you mentioned other companies that are getting into this space and it\u2019s becoming an interesting space for others, and I would throw out that you\u2019ve got to be very, very careful in the distribution business because what we see very often, and if you look into a number of companies, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m saying, is they have big one-time write-offs. They report whatever it is their margin is throughout the economic cycle and then they wait until there is a 9/11, a global financial crisis, a COVID in order to write off the inventory. If you look at HEICO, there\u2019s not a single time that we\u2019ve done that, and the reason is because all of the people in those businesses are geared to make the correct economic decisions to drive cash flow and long term value and not create short term earnings. We start with, number one, low debt which permits us to hold the correct inventory, not the wrong inventory; and number two, we are incredibly rigorous, and I\u2019m not aware of anybody else in t his industry that is as rigorous as HEICO when it comes to inventory. We make sure that if we\u2019ve got a problem, we take it off the books and we don\u2019t spend management time or people\u2019s time focusing on that. The final thing that we\u2019ve got in the distribution business, which frankly differentiates us and permits us to do things that nobody else can do, is our PMA reach. We\u2019re the largest in PMA, we\u2019re in at all the airlines, and we have a very, very broad group of products, so if somebody, for example, is distributing a widget on a 737 but they\u2019re not on the A320, HEICO is in a unique position to be able to get them in that market. There is nobody else in this industry who can do that, so when you combine all the things that I said - the low leverage, the correct inventory, and the PMA combined with an entrepreneurial approach that is second to none, and these folks are into the details unlike anything that you\u2019ve ever seen, and so I think it\u2019s a remarkable business and I want to call it out, because HEICO distribution and our companies in there, in particular led by Seal Dynamics, Blue Aerospace, Air Cost Control are really just absolutely phenomenal and unbeatable in the stuff that they do.\nLaurans Mendelson: Hello, are you still there?\nColin Ducharme: Yes, thank you. \nLaurans Mendelson: Okay, so you asked me about our reach in Europe. We\u2019re an opportunistic buyer. We have reach throughout the U.S., we have reach in Europe. We have a number of operations, very successful operations in France and we\u2019ve been operating in France for a number of years. When we started, we put our toe in the water and we were very successful, and our companies in France have expanded multiple times. We\u2019ve increased employment, and actually the economic development people in France visit us often throughout the year and they want us to invest in France. They like what they\u2019ve seen and they like how we\u2019ve performed. We\u2019re a big taxpayer over there and we\u2019re a big employer, so yes, we have reach. The Exxelia transaction, we had been looking at that, we knew that company for four or five years. We looked at it, discussed it, and so forth. Yes, we do have reach in Europe, and when we see a good opportunity there, we will take it; but it\u2019s not just Europe, it\u2019s Europe, the U.S., the U.K. too. Does that answer your question?\nColin Ducharme: Yes, thank you. Happy holidays.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, everyone. \nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: You know, guys, the attractiveness of the PMA market is clear. You guys have made that industry very lucrative. Now we\u2019re seeing another company expand PMA into the hot section of the jet engine, like high pressure turbine blades. How do you think of that market - is that ripe for PMA to enter, and would you consider going into that part of the aircraft?\nEric Mendelson: Hey Kristine, this is Eric. You know, we\u2019re very familiar with everybody in the PMA market, and I know exactly what you\u2019re speaking about. That has been a market that HEICO has decided to not enter and to not participate in. It is a potential high reward but it is also a potential very high-risk market as well, and we\u2019re very happy in the spaces in which we operate and we think that that really makes a lot of sense from certification, manufacturing, customer acceptance, so we\u2019ve decided really to focus in this market and we\u2019re very happy with that decision. We get along with all of the companies that provide complementary products and we hope that they succeed, but it just--you know, we\u2019ve picked our spots, I would say, very carefully.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks Eric. If that company were to be successful and actually get these parts certified, would that change how you evaluate that industry?\nEric Mendelson: No, it would not.\nLaurans Mendelson: Kristine, can I just add a little color on how we look at the world and what our strategy is? Our strategy, as I think you know, is controlled growth. We focus on 15, 20% bottom line growth. We don\u2019t want to hit home runs. We want to control our cash flow, which is very strong, and everything we do is really focused on cash flow, not so much earnings per share. As long as we get strong cash flow from our businesses, including PMA, that is what we\u2019re looking for. We don\u2019t have to have one spectacular thing in the hot section or that type of thing, but we want a broad offering of parts, highly diversified, and the company HEICO in general is very highly diversified. I don\u2019t know how many parts we make altogether, but I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s going to be at 50,000, 100,000--I mean, and it\u2019s highly diversified and that\u2019s intentional.  We don\u2019t want to get into one particular product that stands out; in other words, if any one product that we make failed to sell or was discontinued, nobody would even notice it. It wouldn\u2019t affect the bottom line at all, and that\u2019s our strategy. That goes to the idea of making these hot section parts and so, but remember we do have some hot section parts. We used to make blades and so forth, and we have of course combustors, but we want to spread it across a wide number of parts and we don\u2019t have to have one spectacular part to accomplish our objectives.\nEric Mendelson: Dad, I\u2019m glad you mentioned that. One of the other things that\u2019s very, very important to us is, as you can gather from our comments on the call and knowing us for so many years, is our reputation. We don\u2019t want to--you know, when you offer lots of parts, you better be very, very careful that the performance of one part doesn\u2019t impact the rest of the portfolio. We have a unique relationship with our customers, I believe with the FAA, and even our competitors, and therefore we\u2019ve made the decisions that we\u2019ve made which are right for HEICO and right for our risk profile and for the benefits that we want to bring to our customers.\nKristine Liwag: Great, thanks Larry, thanks Eric. Really appreciate the color, that\u2019s very helpful.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Kristine.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Hanson [ph], private investor. Please go ahead.\nMike Hanson: I\u2019m one of the minorities, thank you. A question for Victor. According to ETG, when you have sort of marginal sales increase and a 1% decrease in margin, are there parts of the company that maybe you should de-emphasize or spin off and that maybe at the end of the day really wasn\u2019t worth your investment and your time?\nVictor Mendelson: It\u2019s a very good question and it\u2019s something that our subsidiaries look at all the time, which is to say the appropriateness of making a part or not making a part, and there are a lot of decisions that go into that. It\u2019s not always purely economic, although the economics obviously are the overwhelming majority of it. There are times when there\u2019s a part that we will make or there\u2019s something we\u2019ll make because we\u2019re selling something related to that. What we don\u2019t do is get into loss making or low margin positions, but if something is lower than the rest of the margin and we feel, or the business feels they need to continue to offer it or it\u2019s still very profitable, i.e., if maybe a contribution margin of 35% and the business is running at 36%, so you wouldn\u2019t turn away 35% business because it\u2019s not 36%. You wouldn\u2019t make in a sense phenomenal the enemy of excellence, so that\u2019s how we do it. It\u2019s a good question, and that\u2019s a part of the business all the time.\nLaurans Mendelson: I\u2019d like to add one other thing. If we\u2019re running an operating margin of 28%, 30% in ETG, and we discover a company that has a 24% operating margin, we\u2019ll buy that company and it will lower the overall operating margin of the ETG group. Why would we buy it? Because a 24% or 25% operating margin is a hell of a good margin, and we want that company, so you can\u2019t--we don\u2019t get that focused on absolute margin because there are reasons that we might have reduced margin, increased margin, and we have to be very careful. We\u2019re talking, if you heard me earlier, about overall cash profitability, cash flow, and at 24%, even though it\u2019s not our 30%, we get a hell of a good cash flow, so. You have to take all that--when you think about margin, you have to understand cash flow is more important than margin, but high margin brings cash flow. Does that help a little bit?\nMike Hanson: Okay, that\u2019s perfect. But at the same time, are there times that you really look at an acquisition and say, maybe we made a mistake? Over the dozen years I\u2019ve been with you, you\u2019ve always bought-bought-bought, and I can probably count the two or three companies that I\u2019ve read that you\u2019ve spun off.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, so we buy to own forever, we try to make the right decisions. We\u2019ve never had any disasters, blowouts in acquisitions. We\u2019ve had ones that don\u2019t perform as well as others for some period of time and then our jobs are to improve those, and they do eventually - we get them to where they want to be. We do ask ourselves this question, Mike, all the time - are we better off with an acquisition than without it? We do that, we look back, we analyze it historically, and we view is as our jobs to make sure that what we buy performs, even if it\u2019s not as good of a performance as something else.\nLaurans Mendelson: By the way, you mentioned that we spin off companies. We have only sold two companies in the entire 30-some years that we\u2019ve run the business. One was a medical company which we wanted to be out of that industry - it was profitable--\nVictor Mendelson: Services business.\nLaurans Mendelson: It was a services business, it was highly related to labor and so forth, and we sold that business, I believe in 1996, or \u201995--\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, \u201996.\nLaurans Mendelson: The other one was a business that, honestly, we bought for $7 million and we sold it for something like $72 million in about, how many years, Victor?\nVictor Mendelson: Four.\nLaurans Mendelson: About four years, and the reason we sold it is that the operating margin was low. It was an interesting business, we sold it to a company that liked that--wanted to be in that business and wasn\u2019t focused on operating margin. That business had about a 10% operating margin and it was sucking up cash, it was using so much cash that it didn\u2019t make sense to own the business. But we paid 7 and we sold it for 72, so it wasn\u2019t a bad day. Aside from that, we have not sold any or eliminated any other businesses, and as Victor pointed out, thank God we\u2019ve never had a bust. Some businesses have performed better, some have been not so good, but if you take the overall package, again we\u2019re talking about diversification at HEICO, which is a critical strategy for us, putting all those businesses together, as you see, they generated fabulous cash flow and I think that our acquisition performance has been pretty good - you know, close to 100 acquisitions, not having a bust. I think we\u2019ve done pretty well.\nEric Mendelson: Mike, I\u2019ve got a note from the Operator, we\u2019ve actually gone over time, but I\u2019ll just--I will comment, we have not sold a business in 22 years, so that part I can tell you. But unfortunately, I\u2019m getting this note from the Operator that we are over our time by five minutes now, but thank you for the questions. \nOperator: I\u2019ll turn the conference back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaurans Mendelson: This is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank you all for participating in this call and for your interest in HEICO. We remain available to you if you want to call Eric, Victor, myself, Carlos if you have any questions or you want clarification on anything. Otherwise, I want to wish everybody a happy holiday season, a healthy one. If you\u2019re driving or traveling, be safe, and we look forward to speaking to you sometime in mid to late February with our first quarter \u201923 results. This is the end of our teleconference. Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Hey Larry, this is Carlos. Let me jump in there. I think what we're seeing in the flight support group, and it's been amplified, let's say starting in Q2 and running through the end of the year, is some disproportionate growth in specialty products, which has change the mix a little bit in FSG for the back half of this year, which normally isn't the case. Normally, all aspects of the flight support group grow in tandem, and usually our story is a margin that's based off volume growth.  I think what we continue to see is our parts and specialty products outperforming some of the businesses within the flight support group, which has--because of mix has had an impact on--pulling the margin up a little bit. We're happy to see that. As Eric mentioned earlier, it's a 22.5% margin for the quarter, all-time record. We're very happy to see that, but I think once the mix settles back into its footprint, once we get completely out of COVID, we'll see that margin moderate a little bit, would be my expectation. Sure, so we invested--I mean, HEICO, we invested in inventory this year. If you look at our balance sheet, you'll notice that we have a pretty big investment in working capital, particularly for inventory, so I suspect that, as you're pointing out, a lot of companies around the world have done that also.  The impact to us going into next year, I don't think there is a ton of impact on the flight support side because most of the business that we do in the flight support group is ordered and shipped in the same month, there's not a ton of backlog. Within our defense business on specialty products, there's backlog, but most of the aftermarket is really built and shipped in the same month, which implies that most of our customers aren't stocking our product. We have a model with our customers where the parts come when they need it, and they don't have to stock our stuff if they don't want to; in fact, if they do want that, we usually put consignment cages in their buildings and we handle all that for them, so not too much on the flight support side. In ETG, I do think that it has been in vogue, particularly with electronic parts, to go heavy on inventory - we've done that, and yes, I think in '23, could there be some sort of inflection where people hit the pause button? That's possible I think for our businesses, because we're not stuffing channels and over-supplying our customers, I don't believe it's going to be a major impact to HEICO, but I think globally there's something out there that we'll reckon with probably in '23 or early '24. Does that answer your question? All right, Pete, thanks. I think for HEICO, we typically run 20%, 21%, sometimes better than that. This year, our tax rate was amplified for pretty much most of the year except Q1 due to losses in the market, and as Larry mentioned earlier in the call, we have investments in life insurance policies which back what's called our leadership compensation plan, which is a deferred comp plan for our employees, our team members. When the losses on cash surrender value occur, which is impacted by general market trends, we don't recognize a loss on the P&L but what we do recognize is either gains or losses in our tax rate, as a result movement in those permanently deferred items, and so that can have a material impact on our tax rate. This year, it had about a $25 million impact on our tax rate and so that is not insignificant. That is the driver of what could move our rate off that 20% bogey that I would normally target, so if the markets grow, our tax rate will be a little lower. If the markets stay stable, you'll see our tax rate similar to what we had this year, and if we have big losses next year in the market overall, it could amplify our tax rate a point or two. I think so. We're probably targeting somewhere around $40 million next year in capex roughly, so that's about what your math should produce. Sure. I mean, look - Exxelia, I've often said that it almost mirrors--it's like a mini ETG. It's got very similar business strategy and markets, so I think as the electronic technology group flexes throughout the year, I think you'll see Exxelia perform the same way. The only caveat to that is they are a European-based company, so there can be external factors in Europe that would impact them that wouldn't impact us here in the States, but those macro things we can't control, so that will be well known as you read the paper. But no, I don't think there's any--there's nothing on the table that would cause that business to perform much differently than the overall ETG. Hey Ken, I would--you know, in a normal run for HEICO, as I've talked about in the past, you should expect the fixed cost at around 15% plus our normal margin, so that would put us around 35% or 36%. That would be a normal run on growth. That can vacillate depending on events in a quarter and what's happening, but once we settle into our footprint, once all the businesses have kind of settled down and they're growing in tandem again, I think that that's what you should expect. Hopefully as we get into '23, that will be what I would expect to see. Thanks Ken. I think the way to answer that question is we aren't giving guidance, but we do expect the company to perform, let's say better than the industry, just like our history has been. We do expect growth in our sales. I think the stated goal of the company every year when we come out of the box is to grow the bottom line 15% to 20%, and that will be our management team's goal for the year. We've done it pretty consistently for 33 years, and you can see this year we grew 16% on the bottom line, so I think you could reverse engineer it.  If you're thinking about how to get the pieces of that pie, just reverse engineer up from that 15% to 20% bottom line expectation and come up with your numbers, but we're not going to give detailed guidance at this time. Well, we don't know, Michael, when the disruptions from the supply chain fully bleed out, right, so we could have more pushes. But what I will say is that we did have a down year in defense which was in total greater than that $47 million you're referring to, so I think what our expectations are is that as we get into '23, we do expect the overall defense market to improve, at least as it relates to HEICO, and that should be a nice little tailwind for ETG going into '23. All right, thank you Michael. Sure. This is Carlos. We use contingent earn-outs to bridge deal value gaps when we're dealing with sellers. Right now, on the balance sheet, we have roughly $85 million in contingent earn-out obligations, fair value of $85 million. What winds up happening, Gautam, is a couple things: one, you have to evaluate performance of each of the units and re-compute, if you would, what that earn-out may be. But what really impacted us this fiscal year, fourth quarter end throughout the year, was the interest rates going up, because you have to fair value those liabilities, and as the rates go up, those liabilities shrink, right, so we did have some noise throughout the year for these earn-outs. In particular, we had maybe $2 million or something run through the numbers for the fourth quarter as credits to expense to reduce that liability as a result of the Fed's moving the interest rate, and ultimately what that does to longer term or intermediate term risk-free rates. Thank you. It was eight deals. Are you talking about acquired for next year? Yes, I think it will be between 100 and 150. I know that's a wide range, but that's about what it's going to look like. Sure. Colin, I'll hit your first two questions and then hand it to Eric. On the wage and labor front, we're highly sensitive to that. We watch it very closely. Because we are spread out, really, all over the country and all over the world, there are different dynamics in each market. The best way that we have found to deal with those dynamics is to allow our folks in the field, the general managers running our businesses to deal with their local marketplace, to deal with the wage pressures and material pressures on the raw material side. We've also told them that as it relates to pricing, to try to work with our customers to protect our margins. Our objective is to not be those guys - you know, we don't want to be the guys that are known as jacking prices indiscriminately. We want to get paid fairly for what we do, and of course if our input costs do go up, we are asking our customers to help us out in that regard to protect our margins and so far, knock on wood, that strategy has worked very well for us. On the capex side, I did discuss around a $40 million number for next year. This year was a little light in aggregate dollars. It wasn't because we didn't buy what we needed. I feel like it's a broken record, but it's because our folks are frugal, and if they need a million dollar brand-new machine, our guys will put that in as a capex request and then they'll go out and spend $80,000 on a used piece of equipment, drop another $10,000 into it to refurbish it and use that machine for the next decade. That's generally what I'm dealing with. Our capex budgets, while I'd give you that $40 million number for next year, not including Exxelia by the way, that's just our core businesses of today, there is a high probability, like in the past, that we under-spend that, but it will not be because our folks didn't get exactly what they need to conduct business and plan for the future.  Does that answer your question, Colin?"

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies net sales increased 6% to a record $268.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, up from $253 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions partially offset by a slight decrease in organic net sales. The organic net sales decline is mainly attributable to decreased defense and space products net sales partially offset by increased other electronics, medical and commercial aerospace products net sales.  I'd like to point out that the Electronic Technologies Group's backlog remained elevated, reflecting strong orders and increasing delays in receiving components and raw materials from some suppliers. These delays have adversely impacted our planned production and shipment of some products during fiscal '22, but we expect that they should benefit us in fiscal '23 as these products ship. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 4% to a record $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, up from $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, a favorable impact from changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and decreased performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin mainly from decreased defense and space net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 29.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to 30.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross margin partially offset by the previously mentioned changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration and a decrease in performance-based compensation expense.  I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes, I mean, good questions Larry. Those other markets have been very strong for us this year, and in fact I think really toward the end of last year as well. They've really been star performers, all the ones you mentioned - medical, high-end electronics in particular, space a little--commercial space a little--you know, certainly less so and actually a little softer in some instances.  I would expect, by the way, going forward, you've heard me say this before that at some point, we see those other markets flatten out somewhat, and--still I think excellent markets for us, but I would expect them to flatten out or even soften up a little bit as the year wears on and as supply chains get worked out and customers deal with their own channels. Thank you. Yes, I certainly think over time we should exceed DoD budget growth, just knowing our businesses and what we're working on and the things that we do. But of course, in any given period, we may be tied to the defense budget directly or it could be negative, right--our correlation would be a negative one to the defense budget. I would think that you're absolutely right on some of the procurement specialists at the DoD being, let's say, overwhelmed in their workloads and dealing with work-from-home conditions and things like that, which have definitely in our view delayed deferred items from getting put under contract. The supply chain issues, I think have been bigger for us, and I think they were kind of record level for us in the fourth quarter. I was hoping that they would come off in the fourth quarter, maybe we're starting to see a little bit--seeing some green shoots in the supply chain, but I think it's too early to call victory there.  Then of course, you mentioned the foreign engagements, which I think benefit us. I don't think that they are going to cause--you know, be major needle movers necessarily in the next quarter or two. I think actually if you look at what we make and how those things are getting inserted over there, I think they're a little longer burn in terms of just the order cycle and production cycle, but I think as we said in the comments that the dynamic is positive for us. Yes, sure. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, that number actually rose by a little more than $20 million to around $47 million. Now, I won't identify which subsidiary. About half of it actually came in one subsidiary, and so--which had not been experiencing, actually had avoided the supply chain issues for quite a long time. They're estimating they will ship that in fiscal '23. In some ways, there was some improvement over the prior period because a number of other companies saw their numbers shrink, but we had one in particular that was high and then a couple of others that were on the higher side, too, whereas in the past it'd been a little more broadly distributed. This is Victor. The answer is it's particularly on the components side. I mean, we're finding and a lot of our companies have been finding that FPGAs, for example - field programmable gate arrays are slow to come in, they're behind in delivery schedules. We have some other very complex microwave components that are designed specifically for some of the products we make, and there are only a few vendors for those in the world and they are well behind schedule. We've also seen some lead times pull out--push out for, I won't go into which subsidiaries, but some polymer-related products that are used in some of the things that we make, so that has been--I guess that's been where it's extended out. Where it's been better has been on some of the lower cost and more common electronic components that are used in circuit boards and other things that we make, as well as for some silicones and products, interestingly enough some polymer-related products, so it's kind of a mixed bag. Well, a couple things. Exxelia does carry a lower margin than the ETG average. We haven't said what that is, so I can't comment on what it might be, but without Exxelia, excluding Exxelia when I look at--and I think you've heard me say this before, that I think we're within a couple of points on what I call the real operating margin, right, which is--you can sort of think of as a cash flow margin before intangibles amortization but after depreciation. I think that somewhere within a point or two of 30%, either up or down on that, is the right level - I think I've been pretty consistent on it, and Exxelia of course will change that somewhat. I continue to believe that's the case. There are always headwinds and tailwinds, and as you've heard me say before, I don't really come down with a club on people, the people running our businesses, if they're giving us a 31% margin instead of 32% or a 28% instead of 30%, or a 29%, et cetera. I look at it on a gross basis, an overall basis, so I think our margins should remain healthy and we'll continue to be pretty proud of them. You're welcome. Thanks, this is Victor. We're looking at that very carefully, as always. There is opportunity in the LEO market for us. We've been doing business in the LEO market very strongly and successfully for a long time, and of course we still think there's some good opportunity in the GEO market and even smaller satellites now in the GEO market. But we are very careful to avoid some of the more experimental, if you will, parts of the satellite business where we would be more of a financial risk partner, where we're concerned about margins, pricing, stability, reliability and so on. We haven't taken the bait to go out and buy -- I can't count the number of exciting space companies that we hear about, we get a deal book or a teaser on, and it's just, pun intended, straight to the moon. We've really been resistant to those opportunities because we also know that they're highly speculative, so we're going to proceed but proceed carefully. We want to be of very good value to our customers and the ones we have been serving historically, as well as a number of the new ones who we think are serious about buying our products long term. You're welcome. Sure. Right now, the backlog for ETG is fairly typical. It's a record backlog, by the way, and we've had record backlog throughout the year, in fact I was looking at every month through the year with the exception of one, we had record backlog, so as a percent of revenue, it seems to be very strong. We have some additional visibility into future shipments, in part because of those supply chain issues, right - that's a little bit of it, although that is a pretty small fraction, actually, overall, the slippage of our backlog.  And in terms of defense outlook, I would generally say we are not short lead time on our products, and so it's at least kind of a good flavor for the next six months at any given moment, typically, and then sort of it starts to deteriorate from there, which is our typical situation. I would say we're probably in a fairly typical situation now. It's a very good question and it's something that our subsidiaries look at all the time, which is to say the appropriateness of making a part or not making a part, and there are a lot of decisions that go into that. It's not always purely economic, although the economics obviously are the overwhelming majority of it. There are times when there's a part that we will make or there's something we'll make because we're selling something related to that. What we don't do is get into loss making or low margin positions, but if something is lower than the rest of the margin and we feel, or the business feels they need to continue to offer it or it's still very profitable, i.e., if maybe a contribution margin of 35% and the business is running at 36%, so you wouldn't turn away 35% business because it's not 36%. You wouldn't make in a sense phenomenal the enemy of excellence, so that's how we do it. It's a good question, and that's a part of the business all the time. Yes, so we buy to own forever, we try to make the right decisions. We've never had any disasters, blowouts in acquisitions. We've had ones that don't perform as well as others for some period of time and then our jobs are to improve those, and they do eventually - we get them to where they want to be. We do ask ourselves this question, Mike, all the time - are we better off with an acquisition than without it? We do that, we look back, we analyze it historically, and we view is as our jobs to make sure that what we buy performs, even if it's not as good of a performance as something else. Services business. Yes, '96. Four."

            "content": "Thank you and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to the HEICO fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICOHEICO Corporation, and I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's co-President and President of HEICO's flight support group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's co-President and President of HEICO's electronic technologies group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Today my comments will address our consolidated fiscal 2022 fourth quarter results, acquisitions and accomplishments, followed by a presentation for the segment results from Eric and Victor Mendelson, HEICO's co-Presidents.  Now before reviewing our record operating results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's exceptional team members for delivering another strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into outstanding results for our shareholders. I'm encouraged by the steady improvement in our businesses during fiscal '22 and I am very optimistic that this trend will continue into fiscal '23. Summarizing the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal '22 results, consolidated fourth quarter fiscal year '22 net sales and operating income represents record results for HEICO, and that was driven principally by record results within the flight support group mainly arising from the continued rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. In addition, this marks the ninth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income for the flight support group.  Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 improved 27% and 20% respectively as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. These results mainly reflect 11% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the favorable impact from our fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions.  Consolidated operating margin improved to 24% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from 22.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Consolidated net income increased 13% to $97.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from $86.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21.  HEICO's effective tax rate was 23% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to 18.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The increase in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 principally reflects a 7.6% unfavorable impact from tax exempt unrealized losses in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan, and that was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized in the fourth quarter of '21. Later on in this call, if anyone has questions about the detail, this is a complicated matter, Carlos Macau is here and he will be able to explain that to you. Truthfully, it has no impact on our real operations. Our recent activity in acquisitions, in September '22 our ETG group completed the acquisition of Trad Test and Radiation located in Labege, France. Trad is a leader in the highly specialized field of radiation engineering, and their services and products are used primarily in space, nuclear and medical fields. In September '22, our ETG group completed the acquisition of Ironwood Electronics located in Eagan, Minnesota. Ironwood is a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance test sockets and adaptors for both engineering and production use of semiconductor devices.  As previously reported, our ETG group entered into a purchase agreement to acquire approximately 95% of Exxelia International, which is headquartered in Paris, France. Exxelia is a global leader in the design, manufacture and sale of high reliability, complex passive electronic components and rotary joint assemblies for mostly aerospace and defense applications. The transaction's closing, which remains subject to government approval and customary closing conditions, is still expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and would be HEICO's largest ever acquisition in terms of purchase price and revenues. These acquisitions, all of them are expected to be accretive to HEICO's earnings per share within a year of the transactions' closings.  At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's flight support group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the flight support group. Eric? Thank you, Victor. As for the outlook, as we look ahead to fiscal '23, we anticipate net sales growth in both FSG and ETG principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Our largest end market is commercial aerospace, which continued to grow during fiscal '22, and we expect the strong growth trends to continue into fiscal '23.  Our second largest end market is defense. The defense markets were essentially flat for HEICO in fiscal '22. Though we would all prefer peace, global disputes and unrest means more defense equipment is required, providing a favorable environment for defense suppliers. We were negatively impacted by supply chain matters principally for electronic components in fiscal '22, and that delayed certain delivery schedules. We expect these external factors to mitigate in fiscal '23, but we can't predict when. However, we remain very optimistic on the defense industry's future and have seen growth in our orders and our backlog, and that supports our optimism. We will not be providing detailed fiscal '23 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies, strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity all enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and execute on our successful acquisition program, which collectively positions HEICO for continued growth and market share gains.  In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Fiscal '23 looks very promising, and I believe that our culture of ownership and entrepreneurial excellence will provide excellent career growth and opportunities for all your success in fiscal '23 and beyond. Thank you for all that you do to make HEICO a great company. That is the extent of our prepared remarks, and I would now like to open the line for comments and questions from people who are listening. Good morning, Rob. Well, Eric is dying to answer that question, but since you posed it to me, I will respond. I don't want to duck anybody's question, Rob. The basic culture of HEICO is one of a decentralized organization where we give tremendous authority to the operating level. As you know, we have no mid-level vice presidents that filter everything that comes from the operating group up to corporate and to myself, Eric, Victor and Carlos.  The first thing we do in acquisition, the most important is really scrutinize, analyze, get to know the person who is selling the company to us and how he manages. If he treats his people well - this is very important - as an example, if he goes through the factory and he sees somebody and he tell us, oh, that's a machine operator, that's a this and that, that's not very impressive, but some of these people go through the factory and they say--they stop at a machine and say, Charlie here, these are the Mendelsons, how is Anne, meaning his wife, family okay, everything good, Charlie, how long have you been working for, 22 years. This means an awful lot, Rob. We understand the relationship between the owner of the company and his workforce, his team members. That goes a long way and we understand how that all works, and that's the HEICO culture. The other thing is we give tremendous authority and responsibility to the operating person. We believe that the person running his organization knows more about his team members, his labor force, his customers, his manufacturers, everything else, than somebody in a corporate office a thousand or two thousand miles away. Again, it's the authority that we give them, and people who are very talented respect the fact that we give them that authority. Talented people normally do not like somebody breathing down their neck and over-supervising them - what are you doing, what are you doing, so I think that has worked very well. Also, we have a very exceptional 401-K plan where we give employees, if they put in 6%, we match it normally with 5% in HEICO stock. Many, many of our working people - I'm talking about factory workers, shipping clerks, secretarial help are millionaires, some multi-millionaires all as a result of the stock that's HEICO's given them. They take a personal pride in being a HEICO team member. It's not as though, hey, I'm working and I hate my job. They understand that they are being compensated and rewarded by having shares of HEICO stock given to them by the company, they didn't pay for it, so that brings their interest aligned with all shareholders.  We think that most of our people are focused on building HEICO and being part of a team. There's a psychological benefit to call somebody a team member as opposed to an employee. If you're my employee, you work for me; if you are a team member, we all work together, so all of these things are what we call part of the HEICO culture, and I think a lot of that is responsible for our success. Eric, do you want to add? Good morning, Pete. Good morning, Peter. Good morning, Scott. Thank you. Good morning, Josh. Thank you, Gautam. Good morning, Louis. I think I would say it's normal. We're spending a lot of time trying to work with the Exxelia closing, but we are looking for--at a number of acquisitions in both areas, in ETG and in-flight support. The market is a little strange now because sellers want high prices that they saw with low interest rates, and buyers, particularly private equity, is having more of a struggle raising money, so I think I would expect to see prices coming down as long as interest rates are up.  We are very disciplined buyers, as you know, and I think--I'm hopeful that we will see some good opportunities. We're looking at many now. Some of the things that we're rejected, honestly, recently we've seen some companies and they were overpriced, well overpriced, and we made offers and those offers were not accepted, but the deals didn't go either, so the people didn't sell the company. We have to see what's going to happen. We're not going to change our discipline, and as you know, we look for strong cash flow and we want to see our money back, our investment in somewhere between 7 to 11 years, and when you pay 16 times EBITDA, you can't do it, so we're not playing in that market - we never did, we never will.  I think overall I'm optimistic that we will make our fair share of investments. This past year, we concluded how many, Carlos - six? Eight deals, you know, so that's enough in a year, eight transactions. Deals, we are opportunistic, we don't force deals. When deals are priced properly, when we have the right type of company, that's what we will move on it. I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Hello, are you still there? Okay, so you asked me about our reach in Europe. We're an opportunistic buyer. We have reach throughout the U.S., we have reach in Europe. We have a number of operations, very successful operations in France and we've been operating in France for a number of years. When we started, we put our toe in the water and we were very successful, and our companies in France have expanded multiple times. We've increased employment, and actually the economic development people in France visit us often throughout the year and they want us to invest in France. They like what they've seen and they like how we've performed. We're a big taxpayer over there and we're a big employer, so yes, we have reach. The Exxelia transaction, we had been looking at that, we knew that company for four or five years. We looked at it, discussed it, and so forth. Yes, we do have reach in Europe, and when we see a good opportunity there, we will take it; but it's not just Europe, it's Europe, the U.S., the U.K. too. Does that answer your question? Thank you. Good morning, Kristine. Kristine, can I just add a little color on how we look at the world and what our strategy is? Our strategy, as I think you know, is controlled growth. We focus on 15, 20% bottom line growth. We don't want to hit home runs. We want to control our cash flow, which is very strong, and everything we do is really focused on cash flow, not so much earnings per share. As long as we get strong cash flow from our businesses, including PMA, that is what we're looking for. We don't have to have one spectacular thing in the hot section or that type of thing, but we want a broad offering of parts, highly diversified, and the company HEICO in general is very highly diversified. I don't know how many parts we make altogether, but I'm going to guess it's going to be at 50,000, 100,000--I mean, and it's highly diversified and that's intentional.  We don't want to get into one particular product that stands out; in other words, if any one product that we make failed to sell or was discontinued, nobody would even notice it. It wouldn't affect the bottom line at all, and that's our strategy. That goes to the idea of making these hot section parts and so, but remember we do have some hot section parts. We used to make blades and so forth, and we have of course combustors, but we want to spread it across a wide number of parts and we don't have to have one spectacular part to accomplish our objectives. Thank you, Kristine. I'd like to add one other thing. If we're running an operating margin of 28%, 30% in ETG, and we discover a company that has a 24% operating margin, we'll buy that company and it will lower the overall operating margin of the ETG group. Why would we buy it? Because a 24% or 25% operating margin is a hell of a good margin, and we want that company, so you can't--we don't get that focused on absolute margin because there are reasons that we might have reduced margin, increased margin, and we have to be very careful. We're talking, if you heard me earlier, about overall cash profitability, cash flow, and at 24%, even though it's not our 30%, we get a hell of a good cash flow, so. You have to take all that--when you think about margin, you have to understand cash flow is more important than margin, but high margin brings cash flow. Does that help a little bit? By the way, you mentioned that we spin off companies. We have only sold two companies in the entire 30-some years that we've run the business. One was a medical company which we wanted to be out of that industry - it was profitable-- It was a services business, it was highly related to labor and so forth, and we sold that business, I believe in 1996, or '95-- The other one was a business that, honestly, we bought for $7 million and we sold it for something like $72 million in about, how many years, Victor? About four years, and the reason we sold it is that the operating margin was low. It was an interesting business, we sold it to a company that liked that--wanted to be in that business and wasn't focused on operating margin. That business had about a 10% operating margin and it was sucking up cash, it was using so much cash that it didn't make sense to own the business. But we paid 7 and we sold it for 72, so it wasn't a bad day. Aside from that, we have not sold any or eliminated any other businesses, and as Victor pointed out, thank God we've never had a bust. Some businesses have performed better, some have been not so good, but if you take the overall package, again we're talking about diversification at HEICO, which is a critical strategy for us, putting all those businesses together, as you see, they generated fabulous cash flow and I think that our acquisition performance has been pretty good - you know, close to 100 acquisitions, not having a bust. I think we've done pretty well. This is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank you all for participating in this call and for your interest in HEICO. We remain available to you if you want to call Eric, Victor, myself, Carlos if you have any questions or you want clarification on anything. Otherwise, I want to wish everybody a happy holiday season, a healthy one. If you're driving or traveling, be safe, and we look forward to speaking to you sometime in mid to late February with our first quarter '23 results. This is the end of our teleconference. Thank you all."

            "content": "Thank you very much.  The flight support group's net sales increased 33% to a record $346 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, up from $260.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 reflects strong 22% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The flight support group's operating income increased 60% to a record $77.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, up from $48.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, an improved gross profit margin mainly from increased sales within our specialty products and aftermarket replacement parts product lines, as well as efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume.  The flight support group's operating margin improved to a record 22.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, up from 18.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. The operating margin increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 principally reflects decreased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Yes, I mean, I think that's a good explanation of our acquisitions and our culture, but I think Rob, as I was thinking about this, I think it's even more basic than that. It's that when we came to this company 33 years ago, we decided we wanted to build something for the long term, and it wasn't going to be built for years or a single decade, it was going to be built for multiple decades. Frankly, every single thing that we've done and every decision that we take has been designed to drive sustained, long-term growth of the business as opposed to any short-term focus. When we've got to make decisions on everything from inventory, capital expenditures, people, customer relationships, everything is focused on cash generation as a result of also maintaining low debt and being able to create a culture which drives long term performance. As a matter of fact, last night I was reviewing some of our capital expenditure plans and I saw some of our subsidiaries were buying equipment that, frankly, wasn't going to impact '23 or fiscal '24 earnings, but was going to impact it in '25, '26, '27 and after, and I realized that the results that we are showing today, which are frankly, I think, so far above what's normal for the industry, are as a result of that long term focus, and we're really benefiting as a result of decisions that were made 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, that you can't make happen short term. People ask me all the time, why is it HEICO performs? If you look at over the length of the economic cycle, we don't have one-time write-offs, we don't do things that, if you will, goose the earnings in the short term, and I think our culture, which has been designed for a long-term approach, is very, very different than typical corporate culture or private equity, which obviously has--you know, which drives short term results as a result of their compensation structure and everything that they're set out to be.  I really want to call out the people at HEICO because, frankly, the ones who get ahead and the ones who are in positions running our businesses today, are in positions of importance, are frankly the steady Eddies. They're not the ones who came in and all of a sudden had a quick turnaround and a great success, a flash in the pan. Our people have worked hard year in, year out, most over decades, and it's a result of that performance and that discipline and that rigor over decades which has driven the results that we have today.  I just want to call out, frankly, all of our incredible people, our steady Eddies who just continue to work hard year after year and really make this happen. I think that's really what makes us unique. You're welcome. And Larry, also just to add, I think we did--you know, we have seen market share increases and, frankly, tremendous efficiency as a result of the effort of our people, but I also want to add that the margin that we have was--you know, we were still able to drive that margin, even having proper reserves, paying people frankly generous bonuses, and we did everything for the long term and still came out with those margins. We made all of our investments and did everything the right way, and I just couldn't be more pleased with those margins. Yes, I feel very, very good about HEICO's position in the industry. There's no question that a rising tide lifts all boats, but I think that HEICO is in, frankly, a unique position because we've positioned ourselves in our various businesses and I've seen in all of those businesses substantial margin increase, as well as market share increase. We're doing really well. I mean, as a matter of fact, and normally I wouldn't call it out but just so you're getting to this, what's interesting is that our PMA sales are at an all-time record, and if you look, flights across the world are still down whatever - 20%, and we still haven't seen full recovery in Asia and somewhat in Europe and Middle East and South America, and even in the U.S. to a lesser extent, North America. But HEICO PMA sales are at an all-time record, so I think that we've got plenty of power behind us and I think that's as a result of picking up market share and, frankly, treating the customers right. They know that we've treated them right for 30 years and we don't take advantage of them, and we're very fair, we're very reasonable, and they've rewarded us with that market share. It wasn't stuff that we did short term that made it happen, it was stuff that we did long term and they trust us. I think we're really very much in a virtuous cycle which is permitting this. Yes, I mean, we're already doing very well in China, and if China presumably--I mean, my expectation, speaking with various experts, is that China is going to experience hundreds of millions of cases of COVID. Whether they get reported or not is another thing. That should have a chilling effect on their domestic travel. The real question is whether that spreads. Based on the vaccination rates and therapeutics that are available around the world and our natural immunities as a result of everybody else getting infected, hopefully it doesn't impact the rest of the world, but I think China, we're going to see fits and starts. The air travel went up a lot a couple days ago and now it's come down. They're going to be in for a tough 12 months, I think, as a result of where they are with the virus. But we feel very strongly, and that's why we're wired to continue to take market share, and I think we're in a very strong position to do well regardless of how China does, but we are doing very well in China currently. Thank you. Yes, good question Ken. To start out, no, we have not seen any change in order patterns from our customers as a result of the most recent economic data. Things are continuing to be extremely strong, and as a matter of fact, we just keep on hitting new highs. However, we all know that if a recession comes and air travel is curtailed, there will ultimately be an impact. Now, I think the impact on air travel could be a little less perhaps than it's been in other periods, only because we were sort of starved for air travel for about two years, so that may mitigate a little bit of it. But certainly, the industry will be impacted, and clearly you could see it in cargo load factors and dedicated cargo aircraft flying, that those would definitely be curtailed. But I would anticipate that as far as HEICO goes, we're in a unique position, I believe because of the products that we've developed. Although I don't want to cite on this call what they are, I can tell you that a large part of our rebound has been new products that, frankly, hadn't been sold pre-COVID, and a large part of that is new products that we didn't even offer pre-COVID. I think that we're in a unique position to be able to mitigate that, and that is why our PMA results are at a record whereas the industry is--you know, the number of flights is still down 20%, so that would imply upside to us. I think one of the things, though, that you also have to consider is--and historically you've asked the question about destocking and restocking and all that, there's no question it would be normal behavior in a time of shortage to over-buy, and I think that all recoveries do hit a period of over-buying, the question is when that occurs. Nobody tells you, hey, I've ordered 100 parts but I really only need 80 of them right now, and the extra 20 are for the shelf, because they want to get those 20 on the shelf because they're afraid they can't get them. I think that's a natural risk for the industry, but I think HEICO's got the ability to mitigate. Clearly parts and repair would be impacted first and then ultimately new aircraft build rates would be impacted second, if that answers your question. Yes, good questions. Our sales into China in the flight support group are at an all-time record. We're frankly well ahead of our 2019 numbers, so we're doing very well there. I think there is obviously upside from here. I remember--I think it was about a year ago or so, and you asked me did I think by the end of '22, narrow body in the U.S., would it be recovered, and I said I didn't know and I thought it would be hard. But in fact, not only did narrow body U.S. recover but, frankly, the whole world overall recovered for us.  I think we're in a very good position in all of our markets. It's hard to say exactly what's going to happen, to sort of lay out the next 12 months over in China. I think it's going to be fits and starts. I like reading your weekly report on number of flights, and that's got a lot of great data in it, but I think we're well positioned there to grow our market share and we're gaining market share all the time in China. Hi Josh, this is Eric. With regard to the FAA, our cycle time is great, it's outstanding, so that doesn't hold us up at all. With regard to the value set, we continue to go after parts similar to what we've done in the past, as well as what I'll call adjacent white spaces, so we continue to really grow the product portfolio. We've got the largest portfolio in the industry by far, and we're very well diversified across a very, very wide group, so I think we're going to continue to grow. Our customers are asking us to go into more spaces, so we're continuing to do that. You know, we've treated them very well over the decades and we've been very reasonable with regards to pricing, and they greatly appreciate that, so they've been encouraging us and rewarding us with, frankly, much more business, so I think we're in a unique position there to continue to grow market share. This is Eric. With regard to specialty products, we're doing very well. In particular, we also have a lot of exposure to, frankly, to missile defense, and we're doing particularly well in that area, but as well as commercial aviation. Again, we've got a unique value proposition in those businesses and I think they're going to continue to grow and gain market share over time, especially as the aircraft--the commercial aircraft build rates increase. And Colin, you asked why - you know, why we have these results in terms of the sales and the earnings, and I really do believe it starts with our low debt decentralized culture. That permits us to make decisions well in advance and always keep our eye on the long term. When you do that, people are then able to spend their energy on creating true economic value. When you look at the crisis that we just went through, we had plenty of inventory, we continued to develop parts, we continued to treat our customers extremely well as a result of that and, frankly, treat our team members very well because they were critical to our business. I think that is the reason why HEICO continues to outperform, and it's not just in parts and repair but it's also in the specialty products business.  There are all sorts of cases that I can give you where we can significantly jack price on customers and we don't do it. We don't do it because we want to make sure that we retain that business for the long haul. In the short term, people can play all sorts of games with regard to pricing, inventory, all sorts of metrics that you see in the short term; but in the long term, you can't get away with that, and if we want to build this market share like we're doing, the only way to do it is to build the long term and to really have that level of trust, and frankly that's how we incentivize our people. Victor and I each have a whole bunch of businesses that we go and we visit, we know the people not only running them but we know the people in charge of the different departments, all the way down very often to people on the shop floor. We understand who has a long-term culture and who fits with the way we do things and who just plays games, so that's honestly the why in why this happens. This management team has been here for 33 years - I can't think of many management teams, and I certainly can't think of any off the tip of my tongue, that have been there for 33 years and plan on being there decades longer, so. Colin, this is Eric. I'll take the first part of your question that you asked me - you know, the why on the distribution. Our distribution companies are, in my opinion, the single most successful distribution companies in the industry. They started out as small entrepreneurial companies and they continue to run that way. They've got the financial muscle of HEICO behind them so we're able to buy inventory that makes sense, but we also are very, very realistic on the value of the inventory and the value that we bring to the table. You know, you mentioned other companies that are getting into this space and it's becoming an interesting space for others, and I would throw out that you've got to be very, very careful in the distribution business because what we see very often, and if you look into a number of companies, you'll understand what I'm saying, is they have big one-time write-offs. They report whatever it is their margin is throughout the economic cycle and then they wait until there is a 9/11, a global financial crisis, a COVID in order to write off the inventory. If you look at HEICO, there's not a single time that we've done that, and the reason is because all of the people in those businesses are geared to make the correct economic decisions to drive cash flow and long term value and not create short term earnings. We start with, number one, low debt which permits us to hold the correct inventory, not the wrong inventory; and number two, we are incredibly rigorous, and I'm not aware of anybody else in t his industry that is as rigorous as HEICO when it comes to inventory. We make sure that if we've got a problem, we take it off the books and we don't spend management time or people's time focusing on that. The final thing that we've got in the distribution business, which frankly differentiates us and permits us to do things that nobody else can do, is our PMA reach. We're the largest in PMA, we're in at all the airlines, and we have a very, very broad group of products, so if somebody, for example, is distributing a widget on a 737 but they're not on the A320, HEICO is in a unique position to be able to get them in that market. There is nobody else in this industry who can do that, so when you combine all the things that I said - the low leverage, the correct inventory, and the PMA combined with an entrepreneurial approach that is second to none, and these folks are into the details unlike anything that you've ever seen, and so I think it's a remarkable business and I want to call it out, because HEICO distribution and our companies in there, in particular led by Seal Dynamics, Blue Aerospace, Air Cost Control are really just absolutely phenomenal and unbeatable in the stuff that they do. Hey Kristine, this is Eric. You know, we're very familiar with everybody in the PMA market, and I know exactly what you're speaking about. That has been a market that HEICO has decided to not enter and to not participate in. It is a potential high reward but it is also a potential very high-risk market as well, and we're very happy in the spaces in which we operate and we think that that really makes a lot of sense from certification, manufacturing, customer acceptance, so we've decided really to focus in this market and we're very happy with that decision. We get along with all of the companies that provide complementary products and we hope that they succeed, but it just--you know, we've picked our spots, I would say, very carefully. No, it would not. Dad, I'm glad you mentioned that. One of the other things that's very, very important to us is, as you can gather from our comments on the call and knowing us for so many years, is our reputation. We don't want to--you know, when you offer lots of parts, you better be very, very careful that the performance of one part doesn't impact the rest of the portfolio. We have a unique relationship with our customers, I believe with the FAA, and even our competitors, and therefore we've made the decisions that we've made which are right for HEICO and right for our risk profile and for the benefits that we want to bring to our customers. Mike, I've got a note from the Operator, we've actually gone over time, but I'll just--I will comment, we have not sold a business in 22 years, so that part I can tell you. But unfortunately, I'm getting this note from the Operator that we are over our time by five minutes now, but thank you for the questions."

I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: Connie, thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you all for joining us, and welcome you to the HEICO third quarter fiscal '22 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Today, my comments will address our consolidated Q3 results, acquisitions and accomplishments, followed by a presentation of the segment results from Eric and Victor, HEICO's Co-Presidents.  Now before reviewing the quarterly results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for their contributions to another remarkable quarter. Their commitment to producing the highest quality products for customers resulted in excellent quarterly financial results for all HEICO shareholders. And I remain very optimistic in the future for our company. Summarizing the highlights of our third quarter. I will tell you that consolidated third quarter fiscal '22 net sales and operating income represent record results for HEICO driven primarily by record operating results within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued strong rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. In addition, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income for the Flight Support Group. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '22 improved 28% and 21%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21. These results mainly reflect 13% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the favorable impact from our fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions. Consolidated operating margin improved to 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $10.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $6.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. And of course, the increase principally reflects improved operating results of certain subsidiaries in which non-controlling interests are held. We continue to estimate the annual allocation of earnings to non-controlling interest partners to approximate 7% to 8% of percentage of pretax income. HEICO's effective tax rate was 27% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. I want to comment on this tax rate because it's a major issue. And later in this call, Carlos Macau will explain the complexities between actual tax that we pay in cash and the tax provision required for GAAP. But suffice it to say, from an operating point of view, in my mind and management mind, our tax rate is really 21%. And for the analysts out there who are on the phone, if you apply the 21%, which is what we estimate to be our annual tax rate, you will find that the earnings per share for the quarter would be $0.65 to $0.66. In my opinion, and Carlos' too, and he'll go into detail, the additional 7% difference between 21% and 27% will most likely never have to be paid. And Carlos will explain why that is. And I just wanted to point it out very, very clearly. The increase in our tax rate reflected a 5.3% unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in the cash-surrendered value of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Leadership Compensation Plan, and that was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '22. And that compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '21, plus a 2.6% unfavorable impact from a larger income tax credit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '21 due to higher qualifying R&D expenses as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. And that's a big mouthful. It's very complicated. But the simplistic answer, as we look at it, again, is the real tax, in my opinion, and management is 21% for the quarter. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax earnings. The increase in our estimated annual effective tax rate, up from prior year estimates of 18% to 20%, is directly attributable to overall stock market declines causing unfavorable investment results within the HEICO Leadership Compensation Plan during the third quarter of fiscal '22. Consolidated net income increased 7% to $82.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from $76.9 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '21. Liquidity and cash generation was very strong. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 20% to $149.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from $124 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. This, despite our continued investments in working capital to support strong orders and our increased consolidated backlog. We now expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal '22 to approximate $35 million, and this is down from prior estimates of $40 million. HEICO's total debt to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 9.9% as of July 31, '22, and that was down from 10.3% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $112.2 million as of July 31, '22, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 4.5% as of July 31, '22, and that compares to 5.6% as of October 31, '21. Our balance sheet is very, very strong. Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.2x as of July 31, '22, down from 0.26x as of October 31, '21. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '25, and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to continue aggressively pursuing high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and to maximize shareholder returns.  In July '22, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.09 per share, which represented our 88th consecutive semiannual cash dividend. In July '22, our Flight Support Group acquired Accurate Metal Machining, a leading manufacturer of high reliability components and assemblies in the aerospace, defense and semiconductor equipment subsystem supplier markets. Accurate employs approximately 250 people at its Cleveland, Ohio, production facility. In July '22, we announced the agreement for our ETG Group to purchase Exxelia International, which represents HEICO's largest ever acquisition. Exxelia is headquartered in Paris, France, and is a global leader in the design, manufacture and sales of high reliability complex, passive electronic components and rotary joint assemblies who are mostly aerospace and defense products. Exxelia is expected to generate approximately EUR 190 million in revenue during calendar year '22, and has 11 advanced locations worldwide to support its over customers. The Exxelia transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal '23. In August '22, a subsidiary of the ETG Group acquired Charter Engineering, located in Pinellas Park, Florida. And Charter designs and manufactures RF and microwave coaxial switches for the aerospace, defense, commercial and automated test equipment and instrumentation markets. In August '22, we announced the ETG Group acquired Sensor Systems, and that's based in Chatsworth, California, and is one of the world's largest leading designers and manufacturers of airborne antennas for commercial and military applications. Sensors antennas are found on nearly all large commercial transport aircraft built in the last 50 years, along with numerous business and military aircraft. We expect all of these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings within the year following their respective close date. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group to discuss third quarter results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson : Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 39% to a record $330.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $237.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal '22 reflects strong organic growth of 25% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 68% to a record $70.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $42.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal '22, principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly from increased net sales across all product lines, and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. The Fight Support Group's operating margin improved to 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from 17.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The operating margin increased in the third quarter of fiscal '22, principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson : Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 2% to $244.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $239.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our profitable '21 and '22 acquisitions as well as 1% organic growth. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for our other electronics, space and medical products, partially offset by decreased defense product sales, which seems to be common among defense companies this year with U.S. government outlays lagging. The increase in nondefense revenues underscores these other product lines strength in the quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's backlog remains healthy with a roughly 16% increase since October 31, '21, and it remains elevated, reflecting strong orders. However, we've experienced increasing delays in receiving components and raw materials from some suppliers, adversely impacting some defense products, planned production and shipment during fiscal '22 and during the quarter. We estimate somewhere around $25 million of our revenues moved out of fiscal third quarter into future periods, mostly estimated to be in the fiscal fourth quarter due to supplier or even -- supplier issues or even customer ordering delays. Notably, our book-to-bill ratio increased in the quarter and year-to-date.  The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $68 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22 compared to $69 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The slight operating income decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned decrease in defense product sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 27.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 28.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson : Thank you, Victor and Eric. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '22, we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery, despite the potential for additional pandemic variants. We remain cautious and optimistic that the ongoing worldwide pandemic vaccines and boosters rollout will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. While signs of stability in global commercial air travel continue to surface, it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemics path and effect, including factors like new variants, vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions and inflation, which may impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. In closing, I'd like to again thank our incredible global team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO and its shareholders. Together, we continue to win in the marketplace, exceed our customers' expectation and build a larger and more successful company for the future. Your contributions are what makes HEICO an excellent company. I would now like to open the floor for questions. Question-and-Answer Session\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question.\nLarry Solow: Maybe just first question, Larry, if we could just kick off just -- and I realize you haven't closed this acquisition yet, but just on the Exxelia acquisition, obviously, your largest product just ever, sounds exciting. Maybe you can give us a little more color on that? It looks like complementary markets, I pick up you're entering Europe. So maybe that's a nice advantage for you maybe on the defense side. And other -- maybe question one there. And then maybe possible, are there room for improvement on the operating side. It sounds like maybe margins are not quite where you guys are? Or is it just sort of a mix issue there that kind of keeps that down?\nLaurans Mendelson : So I'm going to let Victor furnish most of the color. All I can tell you is that Victor and I and the team have been looking at Exxelia for -- I can't remember, four years by -- I don't remember, we always like this company. We got to know the management. We got to know about the company. And we feel that this will be a great adjunct or addition to the ETG Group. I think their margins are good. They're not the extraordinary 30% margins that we like to see in ETG, but we have good margins. I think we have an outstanding management team there. And I think the opportunities for expansion through acquisition are very realistic. So I think this will be a great addition to the HEICO Group. And I'll let Victor get into some of the more details that he could explain.\nVictor Mendelson : Hey, Larry, those are good questions. I think until we're completely done with the regulatory processes, hold off on kind of predicting anything there other than to say that the same management will continue running the company, the people who are there will be there, and they'll be implementing the plan that they've laid out in their own internal growth plan, which certainly impressed us, and we remain very excited about the company.\nLarry Solow : Okay. No, fair enough. I think the wall you got the mic there, just a couple of just questions for you. The quarter obviously looked pretty good if you take out that sort of $25 million push forward on sales. And maybe just give us a little more color on what's driving this growth with defense. I think you said mentioned being still down a little bit. That's half of your -- I guess close to half of your revenue there in your segment. So is it just a mix of space, medical, general industrial? What's driving that pretty good growth ex defense? And then visibility on defense specifically, do you see that improving as we go out over the next few quarters?\nVictor Mendelson : Yes. So kind of in the order that you raised, those are also good questions. We had very nice growth sort of across the board in most of the -- or all the other markets, some stood out, certainly in percentage terms, for us, space, medical, other electronics markets were particularly strong in the quarter in sales. Aerospace was very nice and telecom, other things that we serve, even some of the smaller markets, and some of the other really small markets or like marine, also very strong. So kind of across the board in the other markets. On defense, as I mentioned in the introductory remarks, we're all seeing that the DoD outlays have been lagging this year. Nobody seems to really know why. There's a lot of different theories on this and so on. I -- my tendency is to be conservative and not believe that it's coming in the next 60 or 90 days that it turns. These things tend to take a little bit longer. That's why the year has worn on, we've been careful in our remarks. No -- for the -- I don't know of any orders, or small amounts maybe here and there, nothing outside the ordinary, that's been canceled in defense for us. There are always -- by the way, in businesses like ours, of course, there are always cancellations and pull-ins and things like that, the normal noise level. But referring to outside of the normal noise, I don't see anything unusual there. And what's happening is, as I mentioned, our book-to-bill has been growing and our backlog has been growing, so it confirms that they're not lost orders, and they ship at some point. And I'm guessing, like I said in the call, some of those are going to be in the fourth quarter and some will be beyond.\nLarry Solow : Okay. Great. Just shifting gears real quest just to give Eric a quick shot out. Just on your revenue trends, obviously, they've been really strong. I assume that we obviously have to slow down as we're back to where it looks like to pre-COVID levels. But can you just give us a little more color on airline inventory levels? And I imagine they're still below normal. And -- how do we -- how do you sort of see the next that coming about? And just in terms of passenger travel, it does -- obviously, it's pretty much back to where we were, I guess, ex sort of business travel, I guess, that's still the lagging factor. But so just trying to see how you vision growth over the next few quarters from a high level.\nEric Mendelson : Yes. All great questions, Larry. And I spend a lot of time thinking about this and talking to our folks about it. No question, our results have been outstanding. I think that we've captured market share. I know we've captured market share. We've got parts that other people don't have. I think HEICO is increasing in credibility in the industry. We're viewed as a major industry participants and supplier. We're not the small PMA company that we used to be many, many years ago. So I think that credibility is very important, and we're viewed very much in a different light. Having said that, North America is -- has returned basically back to the pre-COVID levels, so that's pretty close, with Europe a little bit behind. Of course, Asia is still lagging substantially, and Latin America is lagging somewhat sort of in between Europe and Asia in terms of the return to service. With regard to your questions about inventory. We don't believe that airlines are stocking a lot of inventory. I think a lot of what we have supplied is going directly onto aircraft. However, when you look at the industry in general, and I talk to our people about supply chain and what's going on, there's tremendous extension in the turn time, the quoted turn time to lead times for materials, parts, services, all sorts of things. So as a result, I think it's logical to assume that airlines are buying ahead of their needs. I don't think they are -- they're ordering ahead of their needs. They're not necessarily building inventories, but they have had a very large demand in this return to service as they put aircraft back into service, they needed a lot of maintenance. So there's been a big increase there.  So when you factor all of this together, I think HEICO is going to continue to do very well. We've got to be careful. Obviously, 25% organic growth is outstanding. And we've done this now for quite some time. We're back basically to our pre-COVID levels. So I wouldn't anticipate this kind of growth to continue. We don't know. We're trying to figure it out. Nobody tells you, well, I'm ordering more than I need because I'm worried I can't get it next year. So having done this for a long time, I'm cautious that there could be some of that going on. Now of course, that's going to be mitigated by the recovery in Asia and South America somewhat. So I think we're in a great place. We're going to continue to do very well. But I just sort of cautious about getting extrapolating this too far forward, nobody knows.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nEllen Page : This is Ellen on for Sheila. On your Sensor Systems acquisition, you paid in part with HEICO shares, what made you decide to use equity here? And how does that change the return profile for that transaction?\nLaurans Mendelson : So the reason for that is that one of the sellers of Sensor Systems would only sell because he wanted HEICO shares. And it really was as simple as that. We're very happy to give cash. We have known this seller for -- we have worked on that acquisition for over seven years. He -- the seller really love HEICO. I was approached by many other companies, we believe, who offered more money, but he only wanted to sell to HEICO and he only wanted HEICO shares. And that was the only way we could make the deal, and we were happy to do so.\nEllen Page : Great. And you've been pretty active with four acquisitions announced in the past month or so. Is there anything that changed in the M&A market that allowed you to be more active? Or what drove that activity?\nLaurans Mendelson : No, I don't think so. I think we have often said that we make acquisitions when they become available to us. I think perhaps -- in some cases, it might be that the market for acquisition loans by private equity was getting a little tougher, and private equity when they did their arithmetic found out that they couldn't match the terms that HEICO has on its credit line. So they were -- in one or two cases, they couldn't really compete with us, and we were able to win the day. So I think that might have been part of it. But I can tell you some of these acquisitions, as I said, Sensor, we worked on for seven years. And it's just -- time had come.\nVictor Mendelson : And this is Victor. I would say it really is a question of timing in these deals that we closed and when they came available when we were able to reach terms. In most of the acquisitions we're working on now or we've announced, they were talking exclusively with us, and it's just when the timing became good.\nLaurans Mendelson : Yes.\nEllen Page : Awesome. And maybe just one more on ETG. Do you have any visibility to when that $25 million of delayed revenue will be recovered? Is there something that you need to see in the market? Or how do we think about -- how much confidence you have in recovering any of that in fiscal Q4?\nVictor Mendelson : Yes. Look, I think that our expectation -- our company's expectations is that the bulk of that will be in the fourth quarter, and then some of it will be, let's say, first, second quarter. I mean we don't see it being out that far. But what has happened is that the -- there's a shift that's going on. So we have something that shifts from the second to the third, and then those things that moved into the third quarter shift, but then it was more -- it grew more in the third quarter, the amount that was, if you will, delayed, increased. So as I said on the call that last quarter's call, I think I said that we thought in the first quarter, it was about $10 million worth of delayed shipments. And then in the second quarter, we estimated that grew by 50% to 70%, right, kind of in the $16 million, $17 million range -- $15 million to $17 million range. And now we're estimating in the $25-ish million. So it's that growth in particular that we see.  So I do expect a lot of the third quarter delayed shipments to ship in the fourth, but I expect some pushouts then in the fourth going into the first quarter. And I would hope at some point, those moderate. What my expectation would be is first, they'll moderate, flatten out and then start moving down. But it's possible it moves down straight.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Peter Arment from Baird.\nPeter Arment : Eric, can you maybe talk a little bit about maybe the size of your parts catalog today or the runway that you still see in developing parts? Because obviously, your organic growth continues to be incredibly impressive.\nEric Mendelson : Got it. Yes, Peter. So our parts catalog in terms of PMA, I think you're referring to, is about -- we've got about 13,000 approvals. So it is really quite broad, and it covers many engines as well as all different ATA chapters. So we're in fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, electromechanical, avionics, wheels and brakes, structures, really interiors, all over the aircraft. So I think it's really a very diversified product line, and it's not focused on any one area nor any one competitor. And we like that approach very much. We think that, that really makes a lot of sense. So then you combine -- what you asked about concerning the parts catalog, along with our line replaceable unit or component overhaul capability, and it really is quite large. And then, of course, you add in the distribution and it gets even larger. So we pretty much touch everything in the airplane for a whole variety of customers.\nPeter Arment : And Eric, do you still have the ability to kind of add more to that? I mean, now that you've gotten to such a large size in terms of 13,000-plus parts, do you still kind of see the ability to add a few hundred parts a year as you've done in the past?\nEric Mendelson : Absolutely. We're keeping our new product development spending levels consistent with where they've been in the past. And we continue to develop 300 to 500 new PMAs per year, a similar number of DER repairs. So we're continuing to increase the product range that we've got. In addition, we've got a number of, I would say, extremely complex, critical products, which we offer, which we don't publicly speak about for competitive reasons. Sometimes our competitors know about them. Other times, they don't. But we've been really very -- our team is phenomenal in finding all sorts of opportunities and figuring out how to engineer and how to do this stuff. And as far as I'm concerned, we've got the best sales force on the planet, and they're really able to get a lot of customer excitement and customers to work with us. So customers trust us because the stuff we're doing is very complicated. And they've got to have a high degree of faith in HEICO. And that's why we take so seriously our quality organization and the engineering content that we put in to make sure that we're really extremely robust, very, very thorough. And frankly, what we do goes beyond what's required in any of the regulations but it's something that we've done for 32 years because it's the right thing to do for our customers and to protect HEICO. So we spent a lot of money making sure everything is perfect. And frankly, that's why we've got the quality reputation that we've got. \nPeter Arment : Thank you for that color. And just how do we think about, as wide-body activity starts to recover as going forward, we should see a pickup there. We're already starting to see some pickup in wide-body traffic. How much of an impact will that have on overall FSG?\nEric Mendelson : Yes, it will be very helpful. I'd say Asia, a little bit of South America wide-body that's the upside from here. Most of our business, as I've mentioned before, is a narrow-body. Of course, cargo has done very well, and a lot of that cargo market is basically wide-body aircraft. So we've done very well in that space as well. But I do think there's going to be additional demand, obviously, as the wide-bodies further return to service.\nPeter Arment : Okay. And just one quick one for Carlos. Expectations for the tax rate for the fourth quarter. Do you have -- can you give us a little color there?\nCarlos Macau : Yes. I think you should plan on somewhere around 21% for the year. It could be 20% to 21%. I give you that number that's assuming that we don't have a catastrophe in the stock market. As Larry mentioned earlier, if we have broad losses in the overall stock market between now and our fiscal year-end, that could amplify our rate a little bit again in Q4. But I don't -- I'm not in the business of predicting that. So that's where we stand right now.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ken Herbert, RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Herbert : Victor, maybe if I could first start off with a question on ETG. The last couple of years, you've had a nice sequential improvement in margins from the fiscal third to the fourth quarter. Can you talk about maybe how we should think about margins in the segment this year considering there's clearly some recovery of part of what's been delayed with the normal seasonality -- seasonal benefit you get in the segment?\nVictor Mendelson : Thanks, Ken. Thank you. This is Victor. It's a good question. I am not looking for an increase in margins. If that happens, that would be great. But my own planning, at least is to be more conservative on that and not assume an increase in margins in the fourth quarter at this point. And then we're now in our budgeting process for '23, and we'll start thinking about those. Of course, again, the '23 margins will be moderated from historical levels somewhat because of the Exxelia acquisition, which we've said -- we've talked about their margins being within our -- in our target range, but not at the top, more toward the bottom of our target range. So we'll start to think about those later.\nKenneth Herbert : Just on that point, for the base business, I mean, depending upon where this year ends up, it's hard to say, but I think your margins have been running sort of that 29-ish percentage to maybe 29% to 30% range. Is there any reason in '23, excluding Exxelia, you don't get back to those levels?\nVictor Mendelson : I don't know yet because I really have to see the individual budgets -- by the way, keep in mind that, that's, of course, the GAAP margin after amortization. So the businesses on their own are running about, what, 3, 4 points higher than the 5 -- I'm sorry, so about 5 points higher than that. So if you're running at 29%, that's 34%; if you're running at 28%, that's 33%. And the...\nCarlos Macau : I don't have\u2026\nVictor Mendelson : So it's -- again, as I said on these calls in the past, it's sort of hard to go to somebody and say, you bump, you came in at 32% instead of 33% or 30% instead of 32% or 33%. So that's part of the challenge.\nCarlos Macau : Ken, this is Carlos. Just to follow up real quick on Victor said, there are so many businesses in the ETG and it is a very mix sensitive segment. And with the little bit of the drag that we've had this year on defense, that has brought the margin down a little bit, but we've been running the last couple of quarters, 28%. I think as a management team, we're very happy with that. And as Victor said, I think going into the fourth quarter, we'd be very happy if that maintained at that level.\nKenneth Herbert : Perfect. No, that's helpful. And if I could, just one for Eric. Eric, it's been a few calls now that you've called out sort of incremental opportunities as supply chains continue to stretch for new material into the aftermarket. I'm just curious, as you get these opportunities as they come up, how much opportunity is there for you to really sort of scale the PMA offerings in a particular year or time frame? Or maybe how long does it take to go from identifying an opportunity to perhaps having a product in the marketplace? I mean how quickly can you take advantage of this share opportunity considering the broader supply chain disruptions in the aerospace side?\nEric Mendelson : Yes. A good question, Ken. I'd like to say that to develop, if you're speaking about a PMA part, typical cycle time from when we induct it until we have it available is approximately a year. That can be as short as a couple of months, for something that's very hot and not that complex, to a couple of years for something that's on the other end of the spectrum, something that's super complex. So I would say what we're taking advantage of now is increased penetration of our existing product line. So these are parts that we've had available for sale. There's no good reason why, frankly, more people aren't mind, and it just takes a while to get all this done. And as a result of having them, I think we're able to pick up market share. So I think it's really as a result of that. Also, we were -- since we don't have a lot of leverage, and we make sure that we're very well financed within the company. Unlike others, we didn't squeeze our inventory as nearly as much as others. And as a result, when demand came back, we've been able to satisfy it as opposed to others who have really been -- frankly, drained down their inventories. So I think that's leaving us in good place right now. I would say the market share capture isn't as much from finding an immediate opportunity and developing it as it is stuff that we've already had in process for some time.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn, Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn : I want to follow up on a few things that have already been asked. So Larry, I was going to start with you on M&A. You talked about the concentration of deals and just the random timing there. But is -- I thought your private equity comment was interesting. Are we seeing a different pipeline now than we've seen in the past? And is the size of the transactions getting larger?\nLaurans Mendelson : I don't think so, Rob. I think it's pretty much business as usual. I mean in the past, the very large transactions normally went to private equity and other industry buyers at multiples that we just don't trade in. So if they were trading -- and you know some of the ones I'm talking about 17x, 15x EBITDA and things like that, we have looked at these companies in the past, but we were unable to do that. I think now we're seeing a little bit lower -- so far, a little bit lower pricing because of interest rates. And I think that would normally be expected. Private equity, I think, has to be a little more careful. We've been told by many bankers that private equity has to put in more equity and pay higher interest rates. Some of the banks, we have been told are really out of the ballgame for certain borrowers in private equity. So I think this puts a little bit of pressure on the pricing and lets us participate. But I would say, overall, it's kind of business as usual. And I can tell you that we have many, many deals that are in the pipeline that we're looking at, which is normal for us, but the question is, will we be able to close the deal, will the pricing be right for us? Will our due diligence show? This is really a great company as opposed to some hockey-stick presentation that a seller puts out. And then when we start to dig in and turn over the rocks, we say, wait a minute. So I think the answer is sort of business as usual, may be a little bit better.\nRobert Spingarn : Okay. Eric, a couple for you. I just wanted to go back to this discussion of recovered from COVID. Because clearly, you said wide-body, we're not there yet. I imagine there are certain regional areas where we're not fully recovered, and so notwithstanding the fact that you had record sales in the quarter, which I think were $6 million higher than the prior record quarter, right before COVID, it would seem to me that some of what got you there is share and new products, new customers. Is there a way to calibrate what a recovered quarter would look like if you got that wide-body and you got everybody that you're missing in your sales? In other words, is a $330 million number closer to $400 million fully recovered?\nEric Mendelson : Yes, because we've got, obviously, some acquisitions in there. And -- so it is a higher number. I'm not sure what the number would be. Maybe it's -- I think we're pretty close right now. I'm just thinking for a moment in my head. I mean, maybe it's more like a $370 million a quarter, or $300 million. And -- but that would be a record to record, that kind of thing, maybe $360 million would be record to record.\nRobert Spingarn : Right. With the long lead times for spares, we're hearing the airline to discuss, have -- and given that many of these parts are sourced, are you seeing folks come in at a higher rate and asking HEICO to develop parts because they just can't get them from the OEMs?\nEric Mendelson : Yes. We are seeing definitely tremendous interest in our product line, a lot of trust and confidence in our process and our ability to develop things. We had our global sales meeting for the parts and repair businesses. And I can tell you in my nearly 33 years of doing this, I have never seen such enthusiasm across all of the businesses across all of the regions, all of the people. And frankly, I just have to add, the team that we've got there has been doing this. Some of them have been there nearly 30 years, others 20, others 10. But this is a team that's worked very, very well together for decades. And there's a lot of trust, a lot of confidence. It's extremely well led. And I really think we're seeing, if you will, tremendous internal synergy of being able to respond to our customers' request. We don't have -- it's not like we've got a whole bunch of new people doing this for the first time. It's quite the opposite. It's people who really understand the capability, understand how to get things done at the customers, how to develop the parts, how to get it sold, how to get it bought. And it's really, I would say, a very, very well-oiled machine as well as in our distribution business as well. I mean it's exactly the same thing. And I think these companies are very much hitting their stride. As I said, parts, repair and distribution. I should also add we had our global sales meeting for the distribution business. And again, enthusiasm like I've never seen before as a result of market credibility with both our customers as well as our principles as well as really understanding maturity, just the team that's been together a long time can rely on each other. And so I think market share is a big part of what we are seeing. My comments with regard to return to service, it's hard to figure out exactly where you are in that cycle. But I felt it was something that just had to be caught out because obviously, 25% organic growth can't be done forever.\nRobert Spingarn : Right. This actually brings up another question on the PMA side. There are a few new entrants, some folks trying to get in here, but you just talked about how you've got this well-oiled machine. Does that concern you at all? Or are you just happy when PMA is growing overall? Do you expect this market to have a different growth trajectory post COVID?\nEric Mendelson : My comments, honestly, are focused on HEICO PMA. We have to be very, very careful. HEICO uses a process that we're very proud of that we've developed, and we really fine-tuned over the last 30 years. And I think that is a unique HEICO process. So I'm very reluctant to extend that in general to PMA. I mean, what we see in terms of interest in our product, I think, is very much focused on our product. I specifically ask our people about any competitors in any of the spaces. And we don't believe that the competitors, frankly, are in the same area in terms of technical credibility, product breadth. So I -- my sense is it's much more of a HEICO phenomenon.\nRobert Spingarn : Okay. And then just quickly -- Victor, post all of the deals, could you update us on your end market distribution once these things are fully in?\nVictor Mendelson : Yes. So they should be roughly comparable to what we have now. Defense may grow a little bit. But it's pretty much within the noise level of where we are with the acquisitions we've added. I guess Sensor Systems, that increases our commercial nicely. But overall, it's probably not a major shift. And then there's some other acquisitions we're working on as well that would probably keep us close to around where we are now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]And we'll take our next question from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. \nRobert Stallard : Just a couple of follow up questions from me. On the Exxelia deal, you mentioned it's biggest deal to date and then the margins lower than the overall ETG Group, but how would you compare this business compared to the other things that you see in this division? And does this mark any sort of change in your approach to the sort of deals you'd be willing to do in the future? \nVictor Mendelson: Rob, this is Victor, it's very consistent actually with the strategy in ETG. The overwhelming majority of Exxelia's revenue is derived from components, sub-components, and down at that level, which as you know is a world we love. And that's part of what interested us in it first place or a big part of what interested us in the first place.  So, I don't really see it as a departure shift. It is larger for us, and that just happens to be because it was a larger opportunity that they have done a great job. I will say one thing that is a little different in Exxelia than our typical acquisition is the management team has done an excellent job creating a unified platform, a unified company there. And so, as opposed to just the strict individualistic model that we've typically followed. So this marks kind of our, if you will, participation in something that's more integrated and we're excited about that because I think it broadens our aperture a little bit. \nRobert Stallard : And then Larry, Victor, just to follow-up on your comment from earlier on how these delays seem to have gone from $10 million to $15 million to $25 million over the last three quarters. You seem to be suggesting that we're going to go the other way in the fourth quarter. Is that accurate or do you expect this trend to continue? \nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I apologize if, if I left you with the impression, I think we're going the other way in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure which way it will go in the fourth quarter. My comment to answer one of the other questions earlier was intended to convey that, I don't think it's going to suddenly reverse and that you're going to see this disappear. I think that what's more likely to happen, this is just my opinion, is that at some point, it flattens out and then starts to reverse. But I would expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see some revenue that we had expected to ship, we had scheduled originally to ship in the fourth quarter move out into the first and future quarters. While we ship in the fourth quarter, things that move from the third and, let's say, second quarters.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Pete Skibitski.\nPete Skibitski: Just want to start by talking about SG&A. It looks like you guys are getting some really nice efficiencies here year-to-date and particularly in the last couple of quarters. So I was just wondering kind of what opportunities going forward are there for continuing efficiencies and to what extent they could possibly accrue to the FSG segment?\nCarlos Macau : So no, this is -- I'm sorry, Pete, this is Carlos. In the FSG in particular, we benefited by leverage on the fixed costs. So you're correct. Our spend relative to revenue growth has been stable. Therefore, the percentage has come down. And we pride ourselves on running efficient operations, not overspending on G&A-type activities. I do believe that selling costs as revenues go up will continue to mirror that revenue growth. But overhead, things like that, we'll continue to catch efficiencies on. Same in the ETG, the ETG has had a slight increase in expenditures in the SG&A area relative to revenues. A lot of that was due to the fact that we're not getting this year the growth that we typically are accustomed to. And I think that, too, will cure itself as Victor just talked about as we into probably some more better times out in the future, particularly in the defense area, then I think we'll start catching those efficiencies again on the SG&A spend. So a long way of saying that I believe overall for the company, our fixed costs in the G&A area are stable and low and that we will see selling costs increase proportionately with our sales volume increases.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And just last one for me. When you guys talk about mix a lot in FSG, you talked about specialty products. In specialty products, I think, was up about 50% in the first half of the year. I don't know what it did in the third quarter, but maybe you could talk about demand there kind of going forward over the next kind of six, 12 months in terms of what you're seeing.\nEric Mendelson : Yes. Pete, great question. Demand was very strong. We did very well in the third quarter on specialty products. It's important to note that whereas the aftermarket parts repair distribution has been on the rebound really since -- we've had extremely high organic growth rates -- I'm just looking for my numbers here, of -- if you just bear with me, of -- 32% -- starting in the third quarter of last year, organic growth of 32%, then 28%, 30%, 23%, 25%, very, very high. The specialty products recovered later. So therefore, we are seeing greater growth right now out of the specialty products only because, if you will, the comps on parts and repair and distribution are becoming more difficult because we saw that recover -- the recovery sooner. Of course, when COVID hit, the aftermarket was the one that took the biggest immediate hit because airlines really they needed the parts. Specialty products, continue to ship according to the orders. And so their bottom came later. So we do anticipate additional recovery in specialty products, we think we're doing very well in that section as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak : Just wanted to go back to the ETG margin. I know earlier, you discussed some of the drivers of how it can move around, and what you expect moving forward, and the EBIT versus EBITDA. But I just want to make sure I fully understand what's transpired over the last year or two years. It's been six to eight quarters or so where it's down year-over-year. And so if you just had to hone in on the one or two main drivers of that, what would that be?\nVictor Mendelson : Noah, this is Victor. I would say that main driver would be -- the biggest driver, probably the defense mix. And so it's -- in a sense, that's mix, right? And the mix of products that we've been selling.\nNoah Poponak : So if I look at it on a longer view where it's mid- to high 20s, if I'm just looking at what's happened over the last two years, it's sort of off of a tough compare from a mix perspective, and then the mix has just changed a little bit the last two years.\nVictor Mendelson : Yes. That's correct, I think.\nNoah Poponak : Which items into the mix, like what's a better mix versus worse mix in the segment?\nVictor Mendelson : Well, I've got to be careful because I don't want to get competitors a roadmap into the margins on particular products. I'd like to answer your question, but without breaking out what we don't disclose. I don't know Carlos...\nCarlos Macau : I think, Noah, the one thing I would say to maybe give you a clue is, we have talked about over the last year or so that are other electronics, more industrial-type products that are not as specialized as, let's say, space or defense, have grown very nicely over the past 1.5 years, and that has tilted the mix a little bit towards those products, which have a little bit of a lower margin profile. And so I think that's one reason why you've seen that.  I think as ETG settles in the mix, once we get some of the -- really the defense outlays that Victor mentioned earlier, seems to be one of the things that is driving the shift in mix for us at least this year. Because as Victor mentioned, we do have the orders, it's outlays and it's kind of the muck in the supply chain that's gumming everything up. And I think that delay in order has sort of hurt the mix a little bit for the ETG, which when that happens, we do have a little bit of softening in the rate. But I will tell you this, as a management team, if ETG is kicking out 20% operating margins, I'm standing on the desk doing an Irish jig because that, as Victor mentioned, with the [heavy] amortization back, that's an ATM machine. That's a cash business that's very strong. And if we can continue that, from my seat, I'm going to be very happy.\nNoah Poponak : Okay. Is that -- I mean is that where the segment is going over time with the acquired revenue or -- I mean, in the past, you have kind of consistently pegged where you expect it to land within a range over the medium term. Is there an updated version of that?\nCarlos Macau : Well, we haven't -- we've intentionally not given guidance, no. I do think that what I have said in the past, though, is just if the segment falls between 26 and 30, in we're happy. And I've said that during this time because we have had this mix impact on the business. So I think we'd probably stick with that view for now. We seem to be falling right in the middle of that range, at least discount this fiscal year. So if you think about perspective, that's fine. We'll give some thoughts in December after we get our budgets done as to what maybe the segment might look like at that time, I believe. But for now, if you stick with that range, you'll be fine.\nNoah Poponak : Okay. And then, Carlos, just on working capital, and it's pretty specifically in the inventory line, you've built that as you've, I think, attempted to kind of smartly be ahead of what's happening with supply chain and all of these different pieces of volatility. What are you going to -- how are you going to handle that going forward? Do you need to keep doing that? Or can you reverse that? Is that a cash inflow next year? How does that change going forward?\nCarlos Macau : So I think in the short term, we're going to continue to tell our subsidiaries to invest in inventory. We probably spent during the quarter $18 million to $20 million more in inventory, use of working capital in the quarter, just the three-month period. And I think that I would expect that maybe to continue into year-end. We'll see how things shape out. What we don't want, Noah, is to get in a situation where our customers somehow are not getting HEICO product because we didn't plan appropriately. Now there's nobody is a magician or can see the future. I mean we do our best, right? We are experiencing some supply chain challenges. But I think for the most part, because we didn't go long on inventory, it's benefited our customers and our sales. We'll continue to do that probably sometime in '23 when this mess clears itself up in the supply chain. We'll get back to a normal run rate. And to your point, that may be a source of cash midway into '23 or something like that.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Ciarmoli.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Maybe, Carlos, maybe I just missed this, but to stay on Noah's line of questioning within ETG margins, has inflation been any headwind to the margins there for some of your defense exposed products that might be under kind of price contracts that haven't necessarily reset yet? Is that a component of any of the margin pressure that you sort of commented on mix there?\nVictor Mendelson : This is Victor, Mike. I would say it's in the noise level. I mean as we've said in the past, there's a lag effect, which I think is what you're keying on between inflation setting in and the new contract pricing taking effect. And so -- we don't have a huge part of our revenue under long-term contracts, but we do have some and we do have that lag effect. Now that can be offset in turn by adjustments we make on other contracts where we are not limited. So that's why I say, overall, I don't think inflation has been a big factor in our markets. It's there, but it's not the big driver, right?\nCarlos Macau : And I think, Michael, as a practical matter. We -- our subsidiaries have tried to preserve their margins with pricing. We had certainly not gone overboard with pricing as some other companies have. So that's why we haven't discussed during the year, our margins being impacted from pricing because I think our guys have done a good job, targeted price increases to cover our margins and maintain them.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Got it. And Carlos, I know you're not going to give us guidance here looking at FSG specifically, I mean, you've sort of averaged maybe 8% sequential revenue growth over the past several quarters, realizing there's some acquisition growth in there. But you kind of still think if we're looking forward, sort of a mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth rate. And then, I mean, obviously, you're running extremely high here and record levels for segment operating margins in Flight Support. And I'm not necessarily asking if we can see further expansion. But is this kind of 21-ish percent range kind of stable and good for the near term?\nCarlos Macau : What I've been really consistent on is that -- this segment, I believe, runs at a 20% operating margin, fully loaded all-in GAAP margin. As Eric mentioned a few minutes ago, the margin in the FSG has been elevated the last few quarters because we have seen the mix settle into our normal run rate. We've seen different parts of the business come strong in different quarters. And that mix has amplified the OI margin a little bit. And I think as we settle into our normal mix as we get beyond Q4 and probably in the first of '23, I do believe that the segment will settle in. We expect 20%. Could it be better? Sure. But I wouldn't do long-term projections much higher than that. And you can assume that we'll constantly eke out a little increases to that margin like we have historically. But don't look at two quarters and get over your skis and assume that, that will continue. We hope it does, but I think it's more in the 20% range like we've been talking about.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna, [CA,Web]\nGautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could discuss supply chain at FSG. Has that been an issue? And if so, where are the pinch points?\nEric Mendelson : Yes. The supply chain has been an issue. It's very difficult to get certain raw materials, certain services are very difficult to come by. People are really suppliers are running pretty close to capacity right now. We've been able to manage it, I think, frankly, because our people work really hard and forecasted some of this stuff combined with the fact that we've been able to hold larger inventories to make sure that we can satisfy the demand of our customers. So yes, we -- that still is a huge challenge for us. Even though I don't call it out, it is a huge challenge. It's very, very significant. But we've just been able to figure out how to get it done and not let it hinder the business.\nGautam Khanna : Okay. And can you talk a little bit about where geographically you're seeing strength in the aftermarket on the commercial aftermarket? Is it -- I mean are we starting to see China come back? Or I'm just curious how that pattern has kind of changed over the last six months in terms of areas of strength?\nEric Mendelson : Yes. If you look at where the flights are. So North America is doing very well and is pretty close back to where it was, maybe at 90% level, followed next by Europe. Asia is significantly behind. China is way behind. South America is sort of in between Europe and Asia, so if you look at it with regard to flights. So I think that's probably the best way to look at it.\nGautam Khanna : Okay. And just stepping back and asking about Exxelia again, it looks like a very different type of profile. And I was curious how it fits. And I say that because the number of employees is pretty high, over 2,000. So to Carlos' earlier point on margins, it might be a little lower. I'm just curious sort of how does it fit? And then post that deal, which is fairly large, how bandwidth constrained do you think you are to integrate the other acquisitions, if at all, just give us some backlog on that deal.\nVictor Mendelson : So Gautam, this Victor. So kind of taking in a reverse order, constrained -- about the question about constraints on management because of Exxelia, it actually is the opposite for us because it has a very strong management team, central management team. So we pick up a lot of operations and a number of excellent product lines in one without having to devote the individual resources. Typically, we would buy whatever number of companies that would be, let's say, eight or 10 companies in order to achieve the same results. So that's I think it actually is easier for us given the quality of the management team. And it's a team. It's not just one person who we're relying on. It's a number of people, fortunately. And with respect to the product, what attracts us to what is really that product line. I mean, these are critical they're mission-critical components, many used in high reliability applications, certainly, in harsh environment applications. Their business in the capacitor segments and resistors, for example, in those products. They are not serving the bulk commodity market. They're serving the high end market. So that's a very, very nice fit with us. And then some of their other products that they make that are slightly higher-level integrations are also these mission-critical components that are used generally in more stable applications, right? We're not going after the consumer and the broad industrial markets, although they do have some exposure in those as well. So overall, that's what attracts us. And again, the margins are very good. I mean if we're not going into exactly what they are, but most people would look at that and say, wow, this is well beyond the margin of a typical manufacturing company for sure.  So all put together, and it's a great -- we think it's a great cash generator. We also like the fact, by the way, that it expands our international presence in very important markets to be served locally by people in those countries in those regions as opposed to just trying to serve them from the United States. That's important to us. And the geographic manufacturing footprint that we get out of that. We like that as well. I think it offers us some opportunities as we go forward to be more nimble in production when there are disruptions, and whether those are from future pandemics or supply chain issues or whatever.\nLaurans Mendelson : One other thing -- this is Larry. They have approximately 3,000 customers, and that's a great market reach and the customers they have are amongst the top industrial companies in the world. So this customer list, the ability to possibly market with other product lines that we have, plus the fact that I remind you that the average industrial company has an operating margin of 7% to 11%, and this is basically significantly higher than that. So in other words, one of the problems that we're getting dinged on is that ETG Group is running in the 30s in operating margin. So if we pick a company that's in the 20s, it reduces the margin. But still that\u2019s a great return on investment and very strong cash flow. So we think it will be a very strong acquisition. \nVictor Mendelson: This is Victor. As an aside, you saw in the announcement that they have production in some lower cost countries like Morocco, Vietnam, and generally those are higher headcount, lower wage operations when you're producing those. So generally that influences the number of people. And the last thing, we mentioned it earlier, but I remind you, we think there is possibility of expansion -- acquisition expansion within that group of companies. So overall this is not something that we just found and we acted upon just 1, 2, 3. We've been looking at this company for a number of years. \nGautam Khanna: I appreciate the thorough answer. And I was curious also, just in terms of non-U.S. M&A, is that -- are you seeing more such opportunities with FX and whatever else, is that -- it sounds like it may be one of more? \nVictor Mendelson: There are other opportunities we are seeing outside of the U.S. I wouldn't expect an avalanche of them, but I think we're seeing a few more. And -- but I think our primary acquisition supply, if you will, will come still in the U.S. \nEric Mendelson: Let me remind you too, that some of our acquisitions result from existing company operations introducing us to customers or suppliers that they use. And as we have more foreign operations, those foreign operations will in due course introduce us to companies that they deal with outside of the U.S. But I agree with what Victor says, the majority of our acquisitions I would expect to be within the U.S. but I think we're going to see some more foreign acquisitions too. Some of these companies, these foreign acquisitions are really extraordinarily competent people with extremely high technical capability. I mean, some of the companies that we acquired are in France, for example. France has a serious industrial base and a very highly educated workforce. So the companies that we own in France, we pay high salaries, and they generate strong profits, and we have been able to expand those companies multiple times, and they've been -- they've worked out as very good acquisitions. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Colin Ducharme from Sterling Capital.\nColin Ducharme : Maybe I'll start off with Victor. One clarification and maybe one more insightful question. Clarification, just on your book-to-bill. That sounded like you've healthy uptick there. I don't know if you're able to quantify that any more for us. But if not, just maybe provide some color on what the drivers for that improvement are, whether by market, product or geography.  And then a question on the Exxelia deal, it's getting a lot of airtime today. Pretty exciting, your commentary. It sounds very much like a platform for further kind of building going forward. And I just wanted to try to I guess, clarify that, that's indeed how you and the team are also thinking about it. You talked about opening aperture, is this kind of a land much like Hollywood serves as your kind of central nervous system domestically and increasingly overseas. Is this kind of going to be a central nervous system for the European continent? Does it open the funnel for incremental deals that may make more sense with this platform in your fold that perhaps made less sense prior to the deal?\nEric Mendelson : So Colin, it definitely serves as a platform and a base in Europe for Exxelia to expand. And I would expect that they will continue to make acquisitions. They have actually a history of making acquisitions successfully, and including them, if you will, integrating into their system. And I would expect that to continue. I don't think their plan is to do at a breakneck pace. I think they'll do it at a reasonable pace. But in terms of our other companies in Europe, I don't think our plan is to have them change their reporting lines and to start reporting to Exxelia. Now that doesn't mean that the businesses can't and won't collaborate in a lot of places. And I think there's a lot of opportunity actually for that kind of thing to happen.\nLaurans Mendelson : Yes. By the way, one other thing that we think is -- gives us a good opportunity to expand Exxelia into the States. Exxelia, the majority of its sales are non-U.S. And it does have content in the U.S. It does sell in the U.S. And we think we can increase -- the U.S. is a huge market, of course, and we think that we can help them expand in the U.S. So I think that will be another good opportunity for us.\nEric Mendelson : In terms of your question about Colin, what -- where we're seeing our bookings increase our order flow increase I would say it generally is following the pattern with our revenue to a certain degree. And so the biggest increases are coming in non-defense realms. Although we have -- within defense, we have some pretty nice increases in some of the individual businesses there as well.\nColin Ducharme : And then maybe a couple of follow-ups for the rest of the team. Eric, you talked a little bit about inventory positioning of certain narrow customers for FSG. And I'm wondering, just stepping back, we've seen in certain industrial segments a change in ethos, if you will, on inventory willingness to carry inventory in certain industrial segments. And I'm wondering if pre versus post COVID, that's inherent in your aero customers, meaning they want to run a leaner operation post COVID versus pre, or are things relatively consistent? And then a final follow-up for Larry. You talked a lot about consistency of deal flow not a lot had changed there from a pipeline standpoint. One thing that has changed markedly is the cost of capital, and that changes the math for a certain segment of buyers. And so I just wanted to drill down on that point, if you could ask -- offer a little bit of color if that's changing at all the types of buyers or the timing of getting deals done.\nLaurans Mendelson : So to answer your last question about the timing, cost of money and so forth, we have been told, as I said before, by many investment bankers, not just 1 that in terms of private equity, the banks have tightened up considerably. So private equity is paying more for their borrowing, and we think because of our great liquidity and our ability to just draw on our credit line without going to banks for every approval for every acquisition that it gives us a little bit of a benefit over some of the other private equity. I think some private equity is being stressed a little bit according to what the banks tell us. So I think the increased interest rate probably in the long run is slightly beneficial to us. Now I don't expect that to be a major, major change, but every little bit helps. So I think that's good. Of course, we are also a preferred buyer because we can write a check. And none of our deals are subject to financing. And of course, as you know, a seller, one of the -- two key things in the seller's mind that is price and certainty to close. And with us, the seller has certainty to close because none of our deals are subject to financing. So I think all-in-all, this gives us a slight advantage in the marketplace over what things were before, when interest was very, very low, I mean, the banks were just throwing money at private equity. And so does that answer your question?\nColin Ducharme : Yes. That's helpful. And just to check up on the inventory positioning for\u2026\nEric Mendelson : Colin, yes, this is Eric. With regard to the inventory, I don't see much of a change thus far in inventory strategy from our airline customers. It's something that we're going to watch very carefully. I think they are -- some lead times are getting pushed out. They're also taking that into account into their ordering -- so I think that's an issue. But we don't really -- I don't think there's going to be a really a pre-post coin change regarding airline inventory strategy or at least we don't see it at the moment. End of Q&A\nOperator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Mendelson, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nLaurans Mendelson : Well, thank you very much. And again, thank you to all the participants on the call. I hope we've responded to your questions adequately. If you have other questions, of course, we are available, you know how to reach us. And otherwise, we will look forward to speaking to you after our fourth quarter and full year report later on in this year. So have a very good holiday weekend, which is coming up, and we look forward to speaking to you soon again. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Yes. I think you should plan on somewhere around 21% for the year. It could be 20% to 21%. I give you that number that's assuming that we don't have a catastrophe in the stock market. As Larry mentioned earlier, if we have broad losses in the overall stock market between now and our fiscal year-end, that could amplify our rate a little bit again in Q4. But I don't -- I'm not in the business of predicting that. So that's where we stand right now. I don't have... Ken, this is Carlos. Just to follow up real quick on Victor said, there are so many businesses in the ETG and it is a very mix sensitive segment. And with the little bit of the drag that we've had this year on defense, that has brought the margin down a little bit, but we've been running the last couple of quarters, 28%. I think as a management team, we're very happy with that. And as Victor said, I think going into the fourth quarter, we'd be very happy if that maintained at that level. So no, this is -- I'm sorry, Pete, this is Carlos. In the FSG in particular, we benefited by leverage on the fixed costs. So you're correct. Our spend relative to revenue growth has been stable. Therefore, the percentage has come down. And we pride ourselves on running efficient operations, not overspending on G&A-type activities. I do believe that selling costs as revenues go up will continue to mirror that revenue growth. But overhead, things like that, we'll continue to catch efficiencies on. Same in the ETG, the ETG has had a slight increase in expenditures in the SG&A area relative to revenues. A lot of that was due to the fact that we're not getting this year the growth that we typically are accustomed to. And I think that, too, will cure itself as Victor just talked about as we into probably some more better times out in the future, particularly in the defense area, then I think we'll start catching those efficiencies again on the SG&A spend. So a long way of saying that I believe overall for the company, our fixed costs in the G&A area are stable and low and that we will see selling costs increase proportionately with our sales volume increases. I think, Noah, the one thing I would say to maybe give you a clue is, we have talked about over the last year or so that are other electronics, more industrial-type products that are not as specialized as, let's say, space or defense, have grown very nicely over the past 1.5 years, and that has tilted the mix a little bit towards those products, which have a little bit of a lower margin profile. And so I think that's one reason why you've seen that.  I think as ETG settles in the mix, once we get some of the -- really the defense outlays that Victor mentioned earlier, seems to be one of the things that is driving the shift in mix for us at least this year. Because as Victor mentioned, we do have the orders, it's outlays and it's kind of the muck in the supply chain that's gumming everything up. And I think that delay in order has sort of hurt the mix a little bit for the ETG, which when that happens, we do have a little bit of softening in the rate. But I will tell you this, as a management team, if ETG is kicking out 20% operating margins, I'm standing on the desk doing an Irish jig because that, as Victor mentioned, with the [heavy] amortization back, that's an ATM machine. That's a cash business that's very strong. And if we can continue that, from my seat, I'm going to be very happy. Well, we haven't -- we've intentionally not given guidance, no. I do think that what I have said in the past, though, is just if the segment falls between 26 and 30, in we're happy. And I've said that during this time because we have had this mix impact on the business. So I think we'd probably stick with that view for now. We seem to be falling right in the middle of that range, at least discount this fiscal year. So if you think about perspective, that's fine. We'll give some thoughts in December after we get our budgets done as to what maybe the segment might look like at that time, I believe. But for now, if you stick with that range, you'll be fine. So I think in the short term, we're going to continue to tell our subsidiaries to invest in inventory. We probably spent during the quarter $18 million to $20 million more in inventory, use of working capital in the quarter, just the three-month period. And I think that I would expect that maybe to continue into year-end. We'll see how things shape out. What we don't want, Noah, is to get in a situation where our customers somehow are not getting HEICO product because we didn't plan appropriately. Now there's nobody is a magician or can see the future. I mean we do our best, right? We are experiencing some supply chain challenges. But I think for the most part, because we didn't go long on inventory, it's benefited our customers and our sales. We'll continue to do that probably sometime in '23 when this mess clears itself up in the supply chain. We'll get back to a normal run rate. And to your point, that may be a source of cash midway into '23 or something like that. And I think, Michael, as a practical matter. We -- our subsidiaries have tried to preserve their margins with pricing. We had certainly not gone overboard with pricing as some other companies have. So that's why we haven't discussed during the year, our margins being impacted from pricing because I think our guys have done a good job, targeted price increases to cover our margins and maintain them. What I've been really consistent on is that -- this segment, I believe, runs at a 20% operating margin, fully loaded all-in GAAP margin. As Eric mentioned a few minutes ago, the margin in the FSG has been elevated the last few quarters because we have seen the mix settle into our normal run rate. We've seen different parts of the business come strong in different quarters. And that mix has amplified the OI margin a little bit. And I think as we settle into our normal mix as we get beyond Q4 and probably in the first of '23, I do believe that the segment will settle in. We expect 20%. Could it be better? Sure. But I wouldn't do long-term projections much higher than that. And you can assume that we'll constantly eke out a little increases to that margin like we have historically. But don't look at two quarters and get over your skis and assume that, that will continue. We hope it does, but I think it's more in the 20% range like we've been talking about."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 2% to $244.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $239.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our profitable '21 and '22 acquisitions as well as 1% organic growth. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for our other electronics, space and medical products, partially offset by decreased defense product sales, which seems to be common among defense companies this year with U.S. government outlays lagging. The increase in nondefense revenues underscores these other product lines strength in the quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's backlog remains healthy with a roughly 16% increase since October 31, '21, and it remains elevated, reflecting strong orders. However, we've experienced increasing delays in receiving components and raw materials from some suppliers, adversely impacting some defense products, planned production and shipment during fiscal '22 and during the quarter. We estimate somewhere around $25 million of our revenues moved out of fiscal third quarter into future periods, mostly estimated to be in the fiscal fourth quarter due to supplier or even -- supplier issues or even customer ordering delays. Notably, our book-to-bill ratio increased in the quarter and year-to-date.  The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $68 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22 compared to $69 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The slight operating income decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned decrease in defense product sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 27.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 28.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, and an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Hey, Larry, those are good questions. I think until we're completely done with the regulatory processes, hold off on kind of predicting anything there other than to say that the same management will continue running the company, the people who are there will be there, and they'll be implementing the plan that they've laid out in their own internal growth plan, which certainly impressed us, and we remain very excited about the company. Yes. So kind of in the order that you raised, those are also good questions. We had very nice growth sort of across the board in most of the -- or all the other markets, some stood out, certainly in percentage terms, for us, space, medical, other electronics markets were particularly strong in the quarter in sales. Aerospace was very nice and telecom, other things that we serve, even some of the smaller markets, and some of the other really small markets or like marine, also very strong. So kind of across the board in the other markets. On defense, as I mentioned in the introductory remarks, we're all seeing that the DoD outlays have been lagging this year. Nobody seems to really know why. There's a lot of different theories on this and so on. I -- my tendency is to be conservative and not believe that it's coming in the next 60 or 90 days that it turns. These things tend to take a little bit longer. That's why the year has worn on, we've been careful in our remarks. No -- for the -- I don't know of any orders, or small amounts maybe here and there, nothing outside the ordinary, that's been canceled in defense for us. There are always -- by the way, in businesses like ours, of course, there are always cancellations and pull-ins and things like that, the normal noise level. But referring to outside of the normal noise, I don't see anything unusual there. And what's happening is, as I mentioned, our book-to-bill has been growing and our backlog has been growing, so it confirms that they're not lost orders, and they ship at some point. And I'm guessing, like I said in the call, some of those are going to be in the fourth quarter and some will be beyond. And this is Victor. I would say it really is a question of timing in these deals that we closed and when they came available when we were able to reach terms. In most of the acquisitions we're working on now or we've announced, they were talking exclusively with us, and it's just when the timing became good. Yes. Look, I think that our expectation -- our company's expectations is that the bulk of that will be in the fourth quarter, and then some of it will be, let's say, first, second quarter. I mean we don't see it being out that far. But what has happened is that the -- there's a shift that's going on. So we have something that shifts from the second to the third, and then those things that moved into the third quarter shift, but then it was more -- it grew more in the third quarter, the amount that was, if you will, delayed, increased. So as I said on the call that last quarter's call, I think I said that we thought in the first quarter, it was about $10 million worth of delayed shipments. And then in the second quarter, we estimated that grew by 50% to 70%, right, kind of in the $16 million, $17 million range -- $15 million to $17 million range. And now we're estimating in the $25-ish million. So it's that growth in particular that we see.  So I do expect a lot of the third quarter delayed shipments to ship in the fourth, but I expect some pushouts then in the fourth going into the first quarter. And I would hope at some point, those moderate. What my expectation would be is first, they'll moderate, flatten out and then start moving down. But it's possible it moves down straight. Thanks, Ken. Thank you. This is Victor. It's a good question. I am not looking for an increase in margins. If that happens, that would be great. But my own planning, at least is to be more conservative on that and not assume an increase in margins in the fourth quarter at this point. And then we're now in our budgeting process for '23, and we'll start thinking about those. Of course, again, the '23 margins will be moderated from historical levels somewhat because of the Exxelia acquisition, which we've said -- we've talked about their margins being within our -- in our target range, but not at the top, more toward the bottom of our target range. So we'll start to think about those later. I don't know yet because I really have to see the individual budgets -- by the way, keep in mind that, that's, of course, the GAAP margin after amortization. So the businesses on their own are running about, what, 3, 4 points higher than the 5 -- I'm sorry, so about 5 points higher than that. So if you're running at 29%, that's 34%; if you're running at 28%, that's 33%. And the... So it's -- again, as I said on these calls in the past, it's sort of hard to go to somebody and say, you bump, you came in at 32% instead of 33% or 30% instead of 32% or 33%. So that's part of the challenge. Yes. So they should be roughly comparable to what we have now. Defense may grow a little bit. But it's pretty much within the noise level of where we are with the acquisitions we've added. I guess Sensor Systems, that increases our commercial nicely. But overall, it's probably not a major shift. And then there's some other acquisitions we're working on as well that would probably keep us close to around where we are now. Rob, this is Victor, it's very consistent actually with the strategy in ETG. The overwhelming majority of Exxelia's revenue is derived from components, sub-components, and down at that level, which as you know is a world we love. And that's part of what interested us in it first place or a big part of what interested us in the first place.  So, I don't really see it as a departure shift. It is larger for us, and that just happens to be because it was a larger opportunity that they have done a great job. I will say one thing that is a little different in Exxelia than our typical acquisition is the management team has done an excellent job creating a unified platform, a unified company there. And so, as opposed to just the strict individualistic model that we've typically followed. So this marks kind of our, if you will, participation in something that's more integrated and we're excited about that because I think it broadens our aperture a little bit. Yes, I apologize if, if I left you with the impression, I think we're going the other way in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure which way it will go in the fourth quarter. My comment to answer one of the other questions earlier was intended to convey that, I don't think it's going to suddenly reverse and that you're going to see this disappear. I think that what's more likely to happen, this is just my opinion, is that at some point, it flattens out and then starts to reverse. But I would expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see some revenue that we had expected to ship, we had scheduled originally to ship in the fourth quarter move out into the first and future quarters. While we ship in the fourth quarter, things that move from the third and, let's say, second quarters. Noah, this is Victor. I would say that main driver would be -- the biggest driver, probably the defense mix. And so it's -- in a sense, that's mix, right? And the mix of products that we've been selling. Yes. That's correct, I think. Well, I've got to be careful because I don't want to get competitors a roadmap into the margins on particular products. I'd like to answer your question, but without breaking out what we don't disclose. I don't know Carlos... This is Victor, Mike. I would say it's in the noise level. I mean as we've said in the past, there's a lag effect, which I think is what you're keying on between inflation setting in and the new contract pricing taking effect. And so -- we don't have a huge part of our revenue under long-term contracts, but we do have some and we do have that lag effect. Now that can be offset in turn by adjustments we make on other contracts where we are not limited. So that's why I say, overall, I don't think inflation has been a big factor in our markets. It's there, but it's not the big driver, right? So Gautam, this Victor. So kind of taking in a reverse order, constrained -- about the question about constraints on management because of Exxelia, it actually is the opposite for us because it has a very strong management team, central management team. So we pick up a lot of operations and a number of excellent product lines in one without having to devote the individual resources. Typically, we would buy whatever number of companies that would be, let's say, eight or 10 companies in order to achieve the same results. So that's I think it actually is easier for us given the quality of the management team. And it's a team. It's not just one person who we're relying on. It's a number of people, fortunately. And with respect to the product, what attracts us to what is really that product line. I mean, these are critical they're mission-critical components, many used in high reliability applications, certainly, in harsh environment applications. Their business in the capacitor segments and resistors, for example, in those products. They are not serving the bulk commodity market. They're serving the high end market. So that's a very, very nice fit with us. And then some of their other products that they make that are slightly higher-level integrations are also these mission-critical components that are used generally in more stable applications, right? We're not going after the consumer and the broad industrial markets, although they do have some exposure in those as well. So overall, that's what attracts us. And again, the margins are very good. I mean if we're not going into exactly what they are, but most people would look at that and say, wow, this is well beyond the margin of a typical manufacturing company for sure.  So all put together, and it's a great -- we think it's a great cash generator. We also like the fact, by the way, that it expands our international presence in very important markets to be served locally by people in those countries in those regions as opposed to just trying to serve them from the United States. That's important to us. And the geographic manufacturing footprint that we get out of that. We like that as well. I think it offers us some opportunities as we go forward to be more nimble in production when there are disruptions, and whether those are from future pandemics or supply chain issues or whatever. This is Victor. As an aside, you saw in the announcement that they have production in some lower cost countries like Morocco, Vietnam, and generally those are higher headcount, lower wage operations when you're producing those. So generally that influences the number of people. And the last thing, we mentioned it earlier, but I remind you, we think there is possibility of expansion -- acquisition expansion within that group of companies. So overall this is not something that we just found and we acted upon just 1, 2, 3. We've been looking at this company for a number of years. There are other opportunities we are seeing outside of the U.S. I wouldn't expect an avalanche of them, but I think we're seeing a few more. And -- but I think our primary acquisition supply, if you will, will come still in the U.S."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Connie, thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you all for joining us, and welcome you to the HEICO third quarter fiscal '22 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive VP and CFO. Today, my comments will address our consolidated Q3 results, acquisitions and accomplishments, followed by a presentation of the segment results from Eric and Victor, HEICO's Co-Presidents.  Now before reviewing the quarterly results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for their contributions to another remarkable quarter. Their commitment to producing the highest quality products for customers resulted in excellent quarterly financial results for all HEICO shareholders. And I remain very optimistic in the future for our company. Summarizing the highlights of our third quarter. I will tell you that consolidated third quarter fiscal '22 net sales and operating income represent record results for HEICO driven primarily by record operating results within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued strong rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. In addition, this marks the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income for the Flight Support Group. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '22 improved 28% and 21%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21. These results mainly reflect 13% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the favorable impact from our fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions. Consolidated operating margin improved to 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $10.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $6.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. And of course, the increase principally reflects improved operating results of certain subsidiaries in which non-controlling interests are held. We continue to estimate the annual allocation of earnings to non-controlling interest partners to approximate 7% to 8% of percentage of pretax income. HEICO's effective tax rate was 27% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. I want to comment on this tax rate because it's a major issue. And later in this call, Carlos Macau will explain the complexities between actual tax that we pay in cash and the tax provision required for GAAP. But suffice it to say, from an operating point of view, in my mind and management mind, our tax rate is really 21%. And for the analysts out there who are on the phone, if you apply the 21%, which is what we estimate to be our annual tax rate, you will find that the earnings per share for the quarter would be $0.65 to $0.66. In my opinion, and Carlos' too, and he'll go into detail, the additional 7% difference between 21% and 27% will most likely never have to be paid. And Carlos will explain why that is. And I just wanted to point it out very, very clearly. The increase in our tax rate reflected a 5.3% unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in the cash-surrendered value of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Leadership Compensation Plan, and that was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '22. And that compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '21, plus a 2.6% unfavorable impact from a larger income tax credit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal '21 due to higher qualifying R&D expenses as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. And that's a big mouthful. It's very complicated. But the simplistic answer, as we look at it, again, is the real tax, in my opinion, and management is 21% for the quarter. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% of pretax earnings. The increase in our estimated annual effective tax rate, up from prior year estimates of 18% to 20%, is directly attributable to overall stock market declines causing unfavorable investment results within the HEICO Leadership Compensation Plan during the third quarter of fiscal '22. Consolidated net income increased 7% to $82.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from $76.9 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '21. Liquidity and cash generation was very strong. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 20% to $149.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, and that was up from $124 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. This, despite our continued investments in working capital to support strong orders and our increased consolidated backlog. We now expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal '22 to approximate $35 million, and this is down from prior estimates of $40 million. HEICO's total debt to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 9.9% as of July 31, '22, and that was down from 10.3% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $112.2 million as of July 31, '22, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 4.5% as of July 31, '22, and that compares to 5.6% as of October 31, '21. Our balance sheet is very, very strong. Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.2x as of July 31, '22, down from 0.26x as of October 31, '21. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '25, and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to continue aggressively pursuing high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and to maximize shareholder returns.  In July '22, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.09 per share, which represented our 88th consecutive semiannual cash dividend. In July '22, our Flight Support Group acquired Accurate Metal Machining, a leading manufacturer of high reliability components and assemblies in the aerospace, defense and semiconductor equipment subsystem supplier markets. Accurate employs approximately 250 people at its Cleveland, Ohio, production facility. In July '22, we announced the agreement for our ETG Group to purchase Exxelia International, which represents HEICO's largest ever acquisition. Exxelia is headquartered in Paris, France, and is a global leader in the design, manufacture and sales of high reliability complex, passive electronic components and rotary joint assemblies who are mostly aerospace and defense products. Exxelia is expected to generate approximately EUR 190 million in revenue during calendar year '22, and has 11 advanced locations worldwide to support its over customers. The Exxelia transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal '23. In August '22, a subsidiary of the ETG Group acquired Charter Engineering, located in Pinellas Park, Florida. And Charter designs and manufactures RF and microwave coaxial switches for the aerospace, defense, commercial and automated test equipment and instrumentation markets. In August '22, we announced the ETG Group acquired Sensor Systems, and that's based in Chatsworth, California, and is one of the world's largest leading designers and manufacturers of airborne antennas for commercial and military applications. Sensors antennas are found on nearly all large commercial transport aircraft built in the last 50 years, along with numerous business and military aircraft. We expect all of these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings within the year following their respective close date. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group to discuss third quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor and Eric. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '22, we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery, despite the potential for additional pandemic variants. We remain cautious and optimistic that the ongoing worldwide pandemic vaccines and boosters rollout will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. While signs of stability in global commercial air travel continue to surface, it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemics path and effect, including factors like new variants, vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions and inflation, which may impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. In closing, I'd like to again thank our incredible global team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO and its shareholders. Together, we continue to win in the marketplace, exceed our customers' expectation and build a larger and more successful company for the future. Your contributions are what makes HEICO an excellent company. I would now like to open the floor for questions. Question-and-Answer Session So I'm going to let Victor furnish most of the color. All I can tell you is that Victor and I and the team have been looking at Exxelia for -- I can't remember, four years by -- I don't remember, we always like this company. We got to know the management. We got to know about the company. And we feel that this will be a great adjunct or addition to the ETG Group. I think their margins are good. They're not the extraordinary 30% margins that we like to see in ETG, but we have good margins. I think we have an outstanding management team there. And I think the opportunities for expansion through acquisition are very realistic. So I think this will be a great addition to the HEICO Group. And I'll let Victor get into some of the more details that he could explain. So the reason for that is that one of the sellers of Sensor Systems would only sell because he wanted HEICO shares. And it really was as simple as that. We're very happy to give cash. We have known this seller for -- we have worked on that acquisition for over seven years. He -- the seller really love HEICO. I was approached by many other companies, we believe, who offered more money, but he only wanted to sell to HEICO and he only wanted HEICO shares. And that was the only way we could make the deal, and we were happy to do so. No, I don't think so. I think we have often said that we make acquisitions when they become available to us. I think perhaps -- in some cases, it might be that the market for acquisition loans by private equity was getting a little tougher, and private equity when they did their arithmetic found out that they couldn't match the terms that HEICO has on its credit line. So they were -- in one or two cases, they couldn't really compete with us, and we were able to win the day. So I think that might have been part of it. But I can tell you some of these acquisitions, as I said, Sensor, we worked on for seven years. And it's just -- time had come. Yes. I don't think so, Rob. I think it's pretty much business as usual. I mean in the past, the very large transactions normally went to private equity and other industry buyers at multiples that we just don't trade in. So if they were trading -- and you know some of the ones I'm talking about 17x, 15x EBITDA and things like that, we have looked at these companies in the past, but we were unable to do that. I think now we're seeing a little bit lower -- so far, a little bit lower pricing because of interest rates. And I think that would normally be expected. Private equity, I think, has to be a little more careful. We've been told by many bankers that private equity has to put in more equity and pay higher interest rates. Some of the banks, we have been told are really out of the ballgame for certain borrowers in private equity. So I think this puts a little bit of pressure on the pricing and lets us participate. But I would say, overall, it's kind of business as usual. And I can tell you that we have many, many deals that are in the pipeline that we're looking at, which is normal for us, but the question is, will we be able to close the deal, will the pricing be right for us? Will our due diligence show? This is really a great company as opposed to some hockey-stick presentation that a seller puts out. And then when we start to dig in and turn over the rocks, we say, wait a minute. So I think the answer is sort of business as usual, may be a little bit better. One other thing -- this is Larry. They have approximately 3,000 customers, and that's a great market reach and the customers they have are amongst the top industrial companies in the world. So this customer list, the ability to possibly market with other product lines that we have, plus the fact that I remind you that the average industrial company has an operating margin of 7% to 11%, and this is basically significantly higher than that. So in other words, one of the problems that we're getting dinged on is that ETG Group is running in the 30s in operating margin. So if we pick a company that's in the 20s, it reduces the margin. But still that's a great return on investment and very strong cash flow. So we think it will be a very strong acquisition. Yes. By the way, one other thing that we think is -- gives us a good opportunity to expand Exxelia into the States. Exxelia, the majority of its sales are non-U.S. And it does have content in the U.S. It does sell in the U.S. And we think we can increase -- the U.S. is a huge market, of course, and we think that we can help them expand in the U.S. So I think that will be another good opportunity for us. So to answer your last question about the timing, cost of money and so forth, we have been told, as I said before, by many investment bankers, not just 1 that in terms of private equity, the banks have tightened up considerably. So private equity is paying more for their borrowing, and we think because of our great liquidity and our ability to just draw on our credit line without going to banks for every approval for every acquisition that it gives us a little bit of a benefit over some of the other private equity. I think some private equity is being stressed a little bit according to what the banks tell us. So I think the increased interest rate probably in the long run is slightly beneficial to us. Now I don't expect that to be a major, major change, but every little bit helps. So I think that's good. Of course, we are also a preferred buyer because we can write a check. And none of our deals are subject to financing. And of course, as you know, a seller, one of the -- two key things in the seller's mind that is price and certainty to close. And with us, the seller has certainty to close because none of our deals are subject to financing. So I think all-in-all, this gives us a slight advantage in the marketplace over what things were before, when interest was very, very low, I mean, the banks were just throwing money at private equity. And so does that answer your question? Well, thank you very much. And again, thank you to all the participants on the call. I hope we've responded to your questions adequately. If you have other questions, of course, we are available, you know how to reach us. And otherwise, we will look forward to speaking to you after our fourth quarter and full year report later on in this year. So have a very good holiday weekend, which is coming up, and we look forward to speaking to you soon again. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 39% to a record $330.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $237.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal '22 reflects strong organic growth of 25% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 and '21 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 68% to a record $70.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from $42.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal '22, principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly from increased net sales across all product lines, and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. The Fight Support Group's operating margin improved to 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '22, up from 17.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '21. The operating margin increased in the third quarter of fiscal '22, principally reflects a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Yes. All great questions, Larry. And I spend a lot of time thinking about this and talking to our folks about it. No question, our results have been outstanding. I think that we've captured market share. I know we've captured market share. We've got parts that other people don't have. I think HEICO is increasing in credibility in the industry. We're viewed as a major industry participants and supplier. We're not the small PMA company that we used to be many, many years ago. So I think that credibility is very important, and we're viewed very much in a different light. Having said that, North America is -- has returned basically back to the pre-COVID levels, so that's pretty close, with Europe a little bit behind. Of course, Asia is still lagging substantially, and Latin America is lagging somewhat sort of in between Europe and Asia in terms of the return to service. With regard to your questions about inventory. We don't believe that airlines are stocking a lot of inventory. I think a lot of what we have supplied is going directly onto aircraft. However, when you look at the industry in general, and I talk to our people about supply chain and what's going on, there's tremendous extension in the turn time, the quoted turn time to lead times for materials, parts, services, all sorts of things. So as a result, I think it's logical to assume that airlines are buying ahead of their needs. I don't think they are -- they're ordering ahead of their needs. They're not necessarily building inventories, but they have had a very large demand in this return to service as they put aircraft back into service, they needed a lot of maintenance. So there's been a big increase there.  So when you factor all of this together, I think HEICO is going to continue to do very well. We've got to be careful. Obviously, 25% organic growth is outstanding. And we've done this now for quite some time. We're back basically to our pre-COVID levels. So I wouldn't anticipate this kind of growth to continue. We don't know. We're trying to figure it out. Nobody tells you, well, I'm ordering more than I need because I'm worried I can't get it next year. So having done this for a long time, I'm cautious that there could be some of that going on. Now of course, that's going to be mitigated by the recovery in Asia and South America somewhat. So I think we're in a great place. We're going to continue to do very well. But I just sort of cautious about getting extrapolating this too far forward, nobody knows. Got it. Yes, Peter. So our parts catalog in terms of PMA, I think you're referring to, is about -- we've got about 13,000 approvals. So it is really quite broad, and it covers many engines as well as all different ATA chapters. So we're in fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, electromechanical, avionics, wheels and brakes, structures, really interiors, all over the aircraft. So I think it's really a very diversified product line, and it's not focused on any one area nor any one competitor. And we like that approach very much. We think that, that really makes a lot of sense. So then you combine -- what you asked about concerning the parts catalog, along with our line replaceable unit or component overhaul capability, and it really is quite large. And then, of course, you add in the distribution and it gets even larger. So we pretty much touch everything in the airplane for a whole variety of customers. Absolutely. We're keeping our new product development spending levels consistent with where they've been in the past. And we continue to develop 300 to 500 new PMAs per year, a similar number of DER repairs. So we're continuing to increase the product range that we've got. In addition, we've got a number of, I would say, extremely complex, critical products, which we offer, which we don't publicly speak about for competitive reasons. Sometimes our competitors know about them. Other times, they don't. But we've been really very -- our team is phenomenal in finding all sorts of opportunities and figuring out how to engineer and how to do this stuff. And as far as I'm concerned, we've got the best sales force on the planet, and they're really able to get a lot of customer excitement and customers to work with us. So customers trust us because the stuff we're doing is very complicated. And they've got to have a high degree of faith in HEICO. And that's why we take so seriously our quality organization and the engineering content that we put in to make sure that we're really extremely robust, very, very thorough. And frankly, what we do goes beyond what's required in any of the regulations but it's something that we've done for 32 years because it's the right thing to do for our customers and to protect HEICO. So we spent a lot of money making sure everything is perfect. And frankly, that's why we've got the quality reputation that we've got. Yes, it will be very helpful. I'd say Asia, a little bit of South America wide-body that's the upside from here. Most of our business, as I've mentioned before, is a narrow-body. Of course, cargo has done very well, and a lot of that cargo market is basically wide-body aircraft. So we've done very well in that space as well. But I do think there's going to be additional demand, obviously, as the wide-bodies further return to service. Yes. A good question, Ken. I'd like to say that to develop, if you're speaking about a PMA part, typical cycle time from when we induct it until we have it available is approximately a year. That can be as short as a couple of months, for something that's very hot and not that complex, to a couple of years for something that's on the other end of the spectrum, something that's super complex. So I would say what we're taking advantage of now is increased penetration of our existing product line. So these are parts that we've had available for sale. There's no good reason why, frankly, more people aren't mind, and it just takes a while to get all this done. And as a result of having them, I think we're able to pick up market share. So I think it's really as a result of that. Also, we were -- since we don't have a lot of leverage, and we make sure that we're very well financed within the company. Unlike others, we didn't squeeze our inventory as nearly as much as others. And as a result, when demand came back, we've been able to satisfy it as opposed to others who have really been -- frankly, drained down their inventories. So I think that's leaving us in good place right now. I would say the market share capture isn't as much from finding an immediate opportunity and developing it as it is stuff that we've already had in process for some time. Yes, because we've got, obviously, some acquisitions in there. And -- so it is a higher number. I'm not sure what the number would be. Maybe it's -- I think we're pretty close right now. I'm just thinking for a moment in my head. I mean, maybe it's more like a $370 million a quarter, or $300 million. And -- but that would be a record to record, that kind of thing, maybe $360 million would be record to record. Yes. We are seeing definitely tremendous interest in our product line, a lot of trust and confidence in our process and our ability to develop things. We had our global sales meeting for the parts and repair businesses. And I can tell you in my nearly 33 years of doing this, I have never seen such enthusiasm across all of the businesses across all of the regions, all of the people. And frankly, I just have to add, the team that we've got there has been doing this. Some of them have been there nearly 30 years, others 20, others 10. But this is a team that's worked very, very well together for decades. And there's a lot of trust, a lot of confidence. It's extremely well led. And I really think we're seeing, if you will, tremendous internal synergy of being able to respond to our customers' request. We don't have -- it's not like we've got a whole bunch of new people doing this for the first time. It's quite the opposite. It's people who really understand the capability, understand how to get things done at the customers, how to develop the parts, how to get it sold, how to get it bought. And it's really, I would say, a very, very well-oiled machine as well as in our distribution business as well. I mean it's exactly the same thing. And I think these companies are very much hitting their stride. As I said, parts, repair and distribution. I should also add we had our global sales meeting for the distribution business. And again, enthusiasm like I've never seen before as a result of market credibility with both our customers as well as our principles as well as really understanding maturity, just the team that's been together a long time can rely on each other. And so I think market share is a big part of what we are seeing. My comments with regard to return to service, it's hard to figure out exactly where you are in that cycle. But I felt it was something that just had to be caught out because obviously, 25% organic growth can't be done forever. My comments, honestly, are focused on HEICO PMA. We have to be very, very careful. HEICO uses a process that we're very proud of that we've developed, and we really fine-tuned over the last 30 years. And I think that is a unique HEICO process. So I'm very reluctant to extend that in general to PMA. I mean, what we see in terms of interest in our product, I think, is very much focused on our product. I specifically ask our people about any competitors in any of the spaces. And we don't believe that the competitors, frankly, are in the same area in terms of technical credibility, product breadth. So I -- my sense is it's much more of a HEICO phenomenon. Yes. Pete, great question. Demand was very strong. We did very well in the third quarter on specialty products. It's important to note that whereas the aftermarket parts repair distribution has been on the rebound really since -- we've had extremely high organic growth rates -- I'm just looking for my numbers here, of -- if you just bear with me, of -- 32% -- starting in the third quarter of last year, organic growth of 32%, then 28%, 30%, 23%, 25%, very, very high. The specialty products recovered later. So therefore, we are seeing greater growth right now out of the specialty products only because, if you will, the comps on parts and repair and distribution are becoming more difficult because we saw that recover -- the recovery sooner. Of course, when COVID hit, the aftermarket was the one that took the biggest immediate hit because airlines really they needed the parts. Specialty products, continue to ship according to the orders. And so their bottom came later. So we do anticipate additional recovery in specialty products, we think we're doing very well in that section as well. Yes. The supply chain has been an issue. It's very difficult to get certain raw materials, certain services are very difficult to come by. People are really suppliers are running pretty close to capacity right now. We've been able to manage it, I think, frankly, because our people work really hard and forecasted some of this stuff combined with the fact that we've been able to hold larger inventories to make sure that we can satisfy the demand of our customers. So yes, we -- that still is a huge challenge for us. Even though I don't call it out, it is a huge challenge. It's very, very significant. But we've just been able to figure out how to get it done and not let it hinder the business. Yes. If you look at where the flights are. So North America is doing very well and is pretty close back to where it was, maybe at 90% level, followed next by Europe. Asia is significantly behind. China is way behind. South America is sort of in between Europe and Asia, so if you look at it with regard to flights. So I think that's probably the best way to look at it. Let me remind you too, that some of our acquisitions result from existing company operations introducing us to customers or suppliers that they use. And as we have more foreign operations, those foreign operations will in due course introduce us to companies that they deal with outside of the U.S. But I agree with what Victor says, the majority of our acquisitions I would expect to be within the U.S. but I think we're going to see some more foreign acquisitions too. Some of these companies, these foreign acquisitions are really extraordinarily competent people with extremely high technical capability. I mean, some of the companies that we acquired are in France, for example. France has a serious industrial base and a very highly educated workforce. So the companies that we own in France, we pay high salaries, and they generate strong profits, and we have been able to expand those companies multiple times, and they've been -- they've worked out as very good acquisitions. So Colin, it definitely serves as a platform and a base in Europe for Exxelia to expand. And I would expect that they will continue to make acquisitions. They have actually a history of making acquisitions successfully, and including them, if you will, integrating into their system. And I would expect that to continue. I don't think their plan is to do at a breakneck pace. I think they'll do it at a reasonable pace. But in terms of our other companies in Europe, I don't think our plan is to have them change their reporting lines and to start reporting to Exxelia. Now that doesn't mean that the businesses can't and won't collaborate in a lot of places. And I think there's a lot of opportunity actually for that kind of thing to happen. In terms of your question about Colin, what -- where we're seeing our bookings increase our order flow increase I would say it generally is following the pattern with our revenue to a certain degree. And so the biggest increases are coming in non-defense realms. Although we have -- within defense, we have some pretty nice increases in some of the individual businesses there as well. Colin, yes, this is Eric. With regard to the inventory, I don't see much of a change thus far in inventory strategy from our airline customers. It's something that we're going to watch very carefully. I think they are -- some lead times are getting pushed out. They're also taking that into account into their ordering -- so I think that's an issue. But we don't really -- I don't think there's going to be a really a pre-post coin change regarding airline inventory strategy or at least we don't see it at the moment. End of Q&A"

Parties listening to this call are encouraged to review all of HEICO's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, filings on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by the applicable law. As we begin the call, now I turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much and good morning to everyone on this call. Thank you for joining us and we welcome you to this HEICO second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a few minutes to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another outstanding quarter. Your dedication to our customers and operational excellence has translated into superior results for the shareholders. I am truly delighted by the positive trends in our aerospace business, and I am optimistic that these favorable trends will continue during the remainder of fiscal 2022. I will summarize the highlights of our second quarter fiscal 2022 record results. Consolidated second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 operating income represents record results for HEICO and that was driven principally by record operating income within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from a continued rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 improved 27% and 15% respectively as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. These results mainly reflect a 9% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the favorable impact from our fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions.  Consolidated operating margin improved to 22.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that was up from 20.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. And it improved to 21.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2022. And that was up from 20% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 87% and 33% in operating income and net sales respectively, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. These results principally reflect strong 31% quarterly organic growth for commercial aerospace parts and services. In addition, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. Our total debt to shareholders' equity was 11% as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 10.3% as of October 31, 2021. Our net debt, which is total debt, less cash and cash equivalent of $148.6 million as of April 30, 2022, compared to shareholders' equity ratio was 6.1% as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 5.6% as of October 31, 2021. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.28x and 0.26x as of April 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021. We have no significant debt majorities until fiscal 2025. And we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes in order to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder return. I'd like to discuss our recent acquisition activity, which in March 2022, we acquired all of the stock of Flight Microwave Corporation, which is a designer and manufacturer of custom high power filters and filter assemblies used in space and defense applications. In March 2022, we successfully completed the previously announced agreement to acquire 74% of the membership interest of Pioneer Industries. And Pioneer is a specialty distributor of spares for military, aviation, Marine and ground platforms. The remaining 26% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Pioneer's management team. We expect both of these acquisitions to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 33% to $306.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from $230.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales increased 35% to $579 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from $429.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The net sales increased in the second quarter in first six months of fiscal 2022, reflects strong organic growth of 23% and 26% respectively, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the second quarter in first six months of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income increased 87% to a record $66.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from $35.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income increased 93% to a record $118.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from $61.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating income increase in the second quarter and for six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects an improved gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned higher net sales across all product lines and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. By the way, just as an aside and not part of the scripted remarks, I have to say and congratulate the Fight Support team because frankly, two years after COVID began and created such problems for this industry. I personally am just in awe of these results and the performance of our team. I don\u2019t think anybody expected that we would be back to record numbers within two years after the COVID crisis happened. So I just cannot stress enough how outstanding I think these results are. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin improved to 21.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating margin improved to 20.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from 14.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating margin increased in the second quarter and for six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, as well as a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales were $237.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $243.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales were $459.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to $466.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The net sales decreased in both periods is mainly attributable to decreased demand for our defense products, partially offset by increased demand for our space, medical, other electronics and telecommunications products, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. Like many other defense industry suppliers, our defense product sales declined during the first half of 2022. As to the usual question of whether lower defense sales change or the defense sales change rather was concentrated in a single product. I would say that our defense sales change trends were essentially consistent and we\u2019re more or less proportionate in our various businesses and products, which isn\u2019t surprising is that it seems in phase with the rest of the industry. As we\u2019ve explained over the years, our defense product sales tend to be uneven, which doesn\u2019t worry us given our excellent position supplying components on a wide assortment of programs and our healthy order flow and backlog, so we remain excited about both our long-term defense sales growth prospects and growth in the products and services we sell in other markets. Though, we all wish it weren\u2019t the case, and we wish that piece would reign over our planet. We are convinced that increasing global tensions and risks means the need for our defense products and services will continue to rise over time. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income was $66 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to $71.3 million in the second quarter, fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income was $121.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to $131.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating income decrease in fiscal 2022 second quarter, and first six months principally reflects lower efficiency levels resulting from the previously mentioned defense sales decrease and a lower gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned, decrease in defense product net sales and increase new product research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in order to support important and ongoing new product development activities.  The Electronic Technology Group\u2019s operating margin was 27.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 29.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technology Group\u2019s operating margin was 26.4% in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to 28.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The lower operating margin in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned lower efficiency level, as well as the previously mentioned, lower gross profit margin.  I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. \nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 22% to $0.62 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and that was up nicely from $0.51 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 21% to a $1.25 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that was also up nicely from a $1.03 in the first six months of fiscal 2021.  The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher consolidated operating income. Depreciation and amortization expense, totaled $23.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, that was up from $22.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and totaled $46.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, again, up from $45.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support and this is critical for the development of new products and technologies that will fuel our future growth. R&D expense increased to $18.8 million or 3.5% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that was up from $18 million or 3.9% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. R&D expense increased to $37.1 million or 3.6% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and again, up from $34.2 million or 3.9% of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2021. SG&A expenses were $88.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $83 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and that was an increase of $5.5 million.  The increase in consolidated SG&A expense principally reflects a $3.4 million attributable to our fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions and an increase of $3.1 million in selling expense to support the previously mentioned sales growth. And that was partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in G&A expenses. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $179.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to $161.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. Again, the increase in consolidate SG&A expense, principally reflects costs incurred to support the previously mentioned net sales growth, and that resulted in increases of $6.3 million and $6.1 million in general, administrative and selling expenses respectively, plus $6.3 million attributable to our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. Interest expense decreased to $1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and that was down from $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Interest expense decreased to $1.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that was down from $4.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The decrease in both quarters was principally due to lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. And that reflects our strong cash flow from operations, which we use to pay down borrowings. Other income in both quarters in the first six months of 2022 and 2021 was not significant. HEICO\u2019s effective tax rate was 23.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that compared to 19.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. HEICO\u2019s effective tax rate was 15% in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to 12% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate in the second quarter and it\u2019s first six months of fiscal 2022, principally reflects an unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan as compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized on such policies in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021. The impact of these unrealized losses accounted for an increase of about 3% in our second quarter tax rate and reflect recent overall stock market declines. As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s teleconference, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 of $17.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, resulting from strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option lease holding period. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $15.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to $11.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects improved operating results of certain subsidiaries of the flight support group in which noncontrolling interests are held. And that\u2019s inclusive of fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. For the full fiscal 2022 year, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of 20 \u2013 between 25% and 27% of pre-tax income. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain extremely strong. Cash flow provided for operating \u2013 by operating activities was $96.8 million and $194.8 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022, respectively, as compared to a $102.9 million and $210.1 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021. During 2022, we invested approximately $87 million in working capital. And the change in working capital includes a $43 million increase to inventories, and that reflects a strategic decision to increase inventory purchases within our distribution businesses and to support an increase in our consolidated backlog. In addition, receivables increased $20 million resulting from our net sales growth. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities have decreased by $16 million principally due to timing. Our working capital ratio improved to 3.4 times as of April 30. And that was up from 3.2 at times as of October 31, 2021. Our DSOs, day sales outstanding was 45 days as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 41 days as of April 30, 2021. We closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit risk exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales and our top five customers represented approximately 21% and 23% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate decreased to 150 days where the period ended April 30, 2022. And that was down from 153 days where the period ended April 30, 2021. Now for the outlook, we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2022, and we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery. Despite the potential for additional pandemic variance, we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of pandemic vaccines, including boosters will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve, but it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemic's path and effect, including factors like new variants and vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions, and inflation, which can impact our key markets.  Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2022 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing conservative policies, strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of periodic strategic inventory, purchasing opportunities and execute on our successful acquisition program, which all of which collectively position HEICO for future market share gains. In closing, I would like to, again thank our incredible team members for their support and commitment to HEICO. They are the ones that make HEICO tick and grow. And we are very, very proud of our entire team. The remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond looks very promising for HEICO and to me personally. And we thank you all for making HEICO, the great company that it is. That is the extent of our prepared remarks, and I would like to open the floor to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, it's Gavin on for Noah. Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nCarlos Macau: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Eric, in FSG pricing historically, hasn't been a big lever for you, but it seems like the, the rest of the industry is stepping up there. Is your strategy to increase at the same rate as the rest of the industry? So your relative discount holds, or do you just kind of aim to pass through any higher costs? or how do you think about pricing?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I think the way we, think about pricing is we want to maintain our margins. So our margin percentage at a minimum so, we've got to pass through our added costs, and we've got to add our margin on top of that. Having said that, our list prices often reflect what the \u2013 what our competitors are doing. However, when we've got long term committed customers, we've got contractual arrangements where we sell at a discount to that list price. And we don't take those increases, to the extent that we would necessarily raise our list prices. So it's, it really depends on the, the arrangement, but as you can see from our results, we believe that we've been able to successfully pass along our cost increases along with maintaining a reason, maintaining our profit margin while at the same time, keeping our customers happy. And I actually have to just add a little anecdote was at the MRO Conference in Dallas a couple of weeks ago. And actually we had a major airline that everybody would be very, very familiar with. I can't mention the name and they brought all of their senior leadership to frankly, thank HEICO. In all of my years, I've never had a meeting quite like this, where they brought their senior leadership to thank HEICO; One for coming up with our new product solutions and helping them with all sorts of stuff that others wouldn't. And number two, not taking advantage of them and not doing what other people are doing. And they called out a number of other manufacturers, and they said that HEICO really differentiated itself and was going to be rewarded with not only increased business on products that we currently offer, but increase business on a new stuff that they wanted us to develop for them. So I think as a result of treating our customers, right, this is going to work, we'll get our in summary, we'll get our costs covered, we'll maintain or grow our margins a little bit. And most importantly, we will keep our customers happy because there's a huge amount of opportunity for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. I appreciate all that detail, maybe just touching on the, the margin there and FSG, you're back to, pre-COVID 2Q 2019 revenue, but your margins, I think better than 100 basis points higher. I mean, is there anything abnormal in the quarter there, or is that, a level you can continue to improve from as you grow revenue above pre-COVID levels?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I wouldn't say that there's anything abnormal in the quarter. I want to be careful though, not to predict. I mean, what these numbers, I think our record operating margin percentage for the Flight Support Group, which frankly, I am amazed that in this environment with all that we're aware of, that we're able to keep our customers happy and record margins. So we will continue to watch that very carefully. I want to be careful because obviously we're going to be replenishing inventories. We have to see what that is. We're adding back some positions, growing our engineering talent. So I want to be careful to predict these higher margins. But I feel good about where we're headed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: This is Carlos. I would just add real quickly to that. Keep in mind; we've been thinking about the FSG, approaching this 20% OI level. The road or the path to getting there is going to be a little lumpy because as the businesses return to volume levels that we've seen in the past, different parts of the FSG grow at different rates. And so that's going to affect our margin during the quarter. So that's why, for the year, I would think about it along the 20% range and recognize that it's going to be lumpy up and down to get there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, good morning guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good Morning.\nGautam Khanna: Just to follow up on the last question. Can you \u2013 Carlos, maybe can you talk about the subsegment growth within FSG and maybe that was the source of the mixed benefit. Was it led by the PMA business relative to repair and specialized products? Anything there, that might explain? How quickly margins improved?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, Gautam. I think the PMA business, the parts business, have all been very strong and consistently strong where we saw a little bit of a tailwind, which we expected and we talked about last quarter was the return of our Specialty Products Group. Their volumes have picked up as we thought they would. Their volumes tend to be tied, to the OEM market. And as you probably notice across the board, that's coming back a little bit. So that's helped us, but the, I'd say the rate, especially products increases a little higher than it had been historically, which did have a mix impact if you would, on the margin. That's about the only thing\u2026\nGautam Khanna: Okay, was there any sort of inventory dynamic where, your prices reset faster than the costs reflected in your inventory? So there was a sort of out of phase, benefit from pricing that might end up normalizing, as you replenish inventory?\nCarlos Macau: That's a good question. As Eric mentioned, we have, we do have a bit of a delay. It's not like this is instantaneous. Any of our price increases. It does come in phases over time. As we renegotiate contracts and discuss with our customers, the ongoing relationship that doesn't happen instantaneously. So I don't know that this quarter, we saw a huge impact from pricing. But nonetheless, I think, it will continue. And we will, as Eric said, we'll cover our cost increases. We'll do our best to cover our cost increases, but we're not raising prices as an effort to boost margins and things like that. We're trying to be very friendly to our customers. Again, it's a long term strategy, so.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. And one for Victor, maybe Victor, ETG, can you talk about the bookings, how those have trended, maybe even since the defense budget was formally enacted in March, have you seen a pickup in RFP activity or, anything you can speak to about the \u2013 of order flow? Yes.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, Gautam. It's a good question. Actually, our book-to-bill ratio and our orders are very strong and book-to-bill accelerated for us both in the first quarter of the year, the second quarter of the year, sort of entire first half versus last year, so that remains strong. Of course, like everybody else, we've got these miscellaneous supply chain challenges, which were greater and seem to be accelerating. They're not overwhelming us fortunately, but they are accelerating and that that probably contributes to the book-to-bill ratio even more than it usually does. But as far as we're looking at it book-to-bill is accelerating and strong.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks guys.\nVictor Mendelson: You're welcome.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Larry Solow from CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nLarry Solow: Great. Thank you. Good morning guys and congrats on a really nice quarter and a pretty tough environment, very commendable there. Maybe a question for Eric on the \u2013 an FSG there, obviously pretty remarkable numbers, as you mentioned almost back to pre-COVID levels. I guess you a little bit less, I guess if we take out the acquisitions, but really strong job. What about in terms of, it's got to be a, I know you won't get it specifics, but on the market share gain side, I feel like that must be the, the big deciding \u2013 this different factor between you and some of your competitors. Can you maybe just, go get a little more high-level color on that, on the market share gains and are they coming from any specific areas? Is it, I assume mostly existing customers because you guys are pretty much covered across the commercial aviation, but that where it's coming from and is it mostly older, legacy products or you sort of mixing it in with some newer stuff there?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Larry, that's a great question. And I always get \u2013 I mean, I'm very involved with all the businesses, of course, but I always get prepared in the week before these conference calls to get sort of the latest information on what's going on in the ground \u2013 on the ground. And I can tell you that in all of our business areas in which Flight Support operates. We are, in my opinion, gaining market share. I have never seen \u2013 in my 32.5 years at HEICO, I have never seen this level of enthusiasm from our people. And it is absolutely across the board. It's in PMA parts, component repair, distribution, specialty manufacturing, defense sustainment. It is just completely across the board. And I think that it is as a result of us taking care of our people as times got tough, making sure that we maintained our inventory and actually grew our inventories to make sure that we could support our customers, the fact that we are not highly levered and we're able to make all decisions for the long haul of the fact that our leadership teams and our salespeople have been with the company for decades. I mean they know the HEICO mantra and they speak it as well as if not better than I do. So it is incredibly broad-based. It's in the aftermarket. It's in the OEM. It's in defense sustainment. It's all across our business. And honestly, it made me feel really, really good.\nLarry Solow: That's very encouraging, especially I would assume in these market share gains you get them, they should be pretty long lasting, I guess, in most of these things, right?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I believe that they are long lasting. We've always spoken about how the trend is up and that we need to continue \u2013 look, we're not going to have a large impact on any of our competitors. Our gains are very, very broad-based, and they're incremental. We're doing very well. But I see just tremendous strength and, frankly, everything \u2013 all areas in which we operate.\nLarry Solow: Okay, great. And then just switching gears, a quick question for Victor. On the defense side, is some of the slowness perhaps I know you mentioned sort of supply chain issues, but could some of these issues maybe be \u2013 you guys are obviously just a component on often a component on making the end product. So if there are supply chain issues from other parts that are delayed, maybe you're not going to deliver your part? Does that \u2013 so maybe supply chain issues at competitors or just complementary products, is that also come into play with sort of the slower defense sales?\nVictor Mendelson: Larry, I think, overall, that dynamic does have an effect on us, yes. And it does slow things down. I would say more pronounced is the situation where our customers are not getting products on order because they can't get it out of their factory or they don't have people, people working from home. And so in a number of instances or a few of our subsidiaries, I should say, had mentioned that to us as an issue and that has been actually happening for a while. And at some point, of course, that will even out and we should ship all that. And we get those orders that we're expecting and you hear the customers say things like it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, but we just can't take any more in the factory or in our plant or out of space, et cetera, et cetera. So expect the order a month or two or three or whatever later.\nLarry Solow: Right, right. Okay, great. And if I could just slip one more in for Carlos, just on inflation. Obviously, you guys are having some supply chain issues and like the rest of the world, and you mentioned 40 plus million increase in inventories to help offset that a little bit. But just in terms of inflationary issues, it seems pretty well under control for you guys. I think you mentioned selling your expense at your existing organic was up less than $3 million and I think there was, you said, almost $2 million drop in G&A. So your SG&A was almost from legacy was basically flat, which is pretty remarkable. Any thoughts on that?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I think during \u2013 first of all, we're structurally very entrepreneurial. We have a lot of different subsidiaries and managers running those facilities that have their roots as a sole proprietor and entrepreneur. And so they know how to adjust because when they learn how to manage that business, it was their wallet, their checkbook, right. And I think those tenants have benefited HEICO throughout this process. There is no doubt that inflation is part of the equation and I think that our guys have done an exceptional job at managing that cost. And then also to what Eric mentioned earlier, we've done a pretty good job of working with our customers to cover the increased costs as best we can. So I think the whole equation at HEICO because of our structure allows us to make that happen.\nLarry Solow: Right, great. Okay. Excellent. I appreciate all the color. Thanks guys.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Larry.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning everyone, Larry, Victor, Eric, Carlos. Hi. Hey, Eric, I guess I wanted to ask a question on M&A. Just you guys recently did two deals in the quarter. Are you talking about leaning in a little bit more maybe in the commercial market, maybe what you're seeing in the pipeline? Is there more activity or your willingness to do deals kind of in this recovery period? Or do you need to see some more time pass before you kind of engage further?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We're very active in the M&A area, incredibly busy, busier than we've ever been. We remain disciplined. We recognize that the market is where the market is, and we've got to be competitive. But yes, I think that there are plenty of opportunities and we're working them very, very aggressively.\nPeter Arment: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the \u2013 Victor, you mentioned some supply chain \u2013 miscellaneous supply chain constraints. Maybe Eric and Victor, you could just both describe it, are you seeing any kind of material lead time stretch out or are you going to end up just ultimately like you've kind of indicated carrying a lot more inventory throughout the year?\nVictor Mendelson: So, this is Victor. I'll give you a perspective for the ETG companies. Lead times from suppliers continue to increase. There are lead times that are out for some components as far as, believe it or not, over 100 weeks. That's the exception though fortunately not the rule. We have generally, of course, found workarounds around those. And as you know, our inventory approach has been such that we've really minimized the effect of that. But I would expect this to continue to be a challenge. I would expect it to continue to accelerate a little bit. I would say that I think on our last conference call, I estimated that we had sort of in the $10 million range that had slipped from one quarter into the next quarter and I would say that's probably 50%, 70% more in this quarter that we just finished than it was in the prior quarter. And so again, you're talking about a few percent of sales, not overwhelming, but certainly something actually our growth would have been considerably higher or somewhat higher had we not dealt with that. But we'll continue to let our companies address those and keep it down to sort of a low simmer as they would say, rather than a more fire.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. And Peter, with regard to the Flight Support side I think that we were smart. Our people were really intelligent to make sure that we had sufficient inventory coming into this. We're working very closely with our suppliers. Frankly, there's no shortage of orders for us. The challenge is going to be making sure that we get everything delivered on time. And I think there could be hiccups down the road. Our people tell me about problems and they ultimately figure out solutions to them. So I would say on high alert watching the inventory restocking issue, but I'm hopeful that we will figure out how to manage through it.\nPeter Arment: I appreciate that. And then just one last one, Eric, on the new product kind of rollouts, I know you always just kind of talk in generalities, but it sounds like customers are approaching you and there is more opportunities coming up. Maybe if you could describe, is the pace of the new product introductions increasing from the past kind of historical, what you add to your catalog every year? Or are you seeing, I guess, more of an acceleration of adoption?\nEric Mendelson: It would be the latter, more of \u2013 a greater acceleration of adoption. I think we're very content with the pace of new product development. We've got a lot of unsold potential where people can save a lot more money, if they buy the rest of our product line. So I think our preference would be to get all that stuff sold first and then to increase the rate of new product development later. We are \u2013 we continually grow in adjacent, what I call adjacent white spaces. And so there's no change there, but we got to make sure that we get everything sold. And I think our current volume and rate of new product development is really very, very well optimized. We've got the chain balanced, if we increase new product development, then you got to increase procurement, manufacturing, inspection, sales, there's a lot of stuff that has to happen in order to support that. So I think we're really well balanced right now.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate that. Thanks.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have the next question from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJason Holcomb: Good morning, guys. This is Jason on for Kristine.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nJason Holcomb: Eric and Victor, sort of as we look ahead, how should we think about potential recessionary impacts across both the ETG and FSG businesses?\nEric Mendelson: When you say recessionary impacts, you mean with the markets that turning down possibly in the future?\nJason Holcomb: Exactly. So I guess, driven by say GDP decline, just general recessionary impact.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think we've picked up market share and we in a downturn continue to pick up market share. So I'm not afraid of it, frankly, whatsoever. We don't at the moment, see that kind of impact, there's no question there's deflationary issues when it comes to consumer products. And that's because for the last two years, people have bought a lot of that stuff, especially with all the money that the government has pumped out there and given to consumers. However, if you look, the savings levels are still pretty elevated. And the one thing that everybody wants to do today, they don't care whether they have COVID, they risk of getting COVID, nobody cares. They're all traveling, everybody's been cooped up. And I think that trend is going to continue. So I don't see that same historic two times GDP impact on air travel occurring over the next couple of years. I think we've paid a huge price in the past few years. And I think air travel is going to be relatively strong, X obviously Russia, Ukraine, China, I mean that there are some places that are going to see an impact. But I think with \u2013 insofar as how it's going to impact HEICO, we are so well ingrained at our customers and they view us \u2013 I can't stress it enough that they no longer view us as this tiny little $30 million company that we were 30 years ago. I mean, they view us as a real powerhouse and power player in the industry. So I think we're going to be the go to company, frankly.\nVictor Mendelson: And this is Victor, for ETG, the effect the recession would have, it's fairly muted typically for us because we have a high proportion coming from defense and space and medical combined, those markets, which tend not to suffer like the broader economy does in a recession. Now our general markets where we serve certain high end electronics that might feel an impact and commercial aviation, depending on what happens with travel. But at this point, by the way, we are not seeing that. And interestingly enough, our orders in our non-A&D markets, which I very often look at as a precursor to overall economic activity have remained strong and remain healthy. So at this point, it seems to be business as usual.\nJason Holcomb: Thank you, guys. And then maybe just one more for Victor. Victor, can you speak to some of the opportunities you're seeing in space and then sort of just maybe parse out the opportunities you're seeing in the near-term and then more on a longer time horizon?\nVictor Mendelson: Yeas, so our space business, as you know, is really focused on what I would call the high end in space. We're not on micro SATs very much. We don't chase those markets. We try to pursue and we've been successful pursuing the very highly engineered high end, very often radiation tolerant or radiation hardened solution. So for bigger, if you will, more expensive satellites but not entirely and that's a part of it. So what we're not doing is we're not chasing after this kind of explosion in everything space and I think our opportunities will continue to be in the higher end, more highly engineered products. And that's really where we're looking to expand as opposed to just sort of picking up revenue at any old margin to us. Our view is if it's a healthy margin, then it means we're adding some important value to the customer. And if it's low margin, then we're probably \u2013 we'd be looking at something that's more commoditized or they feel they could get elsewhere.\nJason Holcomb: Understood. Thanks guys.\nVictor Mendelson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC. Your line is open.\nKen Herbert: Yes. Hi, good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Hey Eric, I just wanted to start with maybe a finer point on the previous question, is it fair to say then that you haven't seen any change in pace of bookings or backlogs within your repair business into the second half of the fiscal year, as a result of any airline concerns around booking trends or maybe any slowdown in the pace of growth and then thinking that through, is there any reason why we shouldn't continue to assume sequential growth for your business into the fiscal third and fourth quarters?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I think I mean the booking trends are improving and so I expect continued growth in the third and fourth quarters. I think that we're grabbing market share. And I anticipate that we're going to continue to do very well in all of our businesses in the third and fourth quarters.\nKen Herbert: Okay. That's great. And if I could maybe Carlos, typically seasonally, you do very good from a cash standpoint into the back half of the year. I know you've been investing in working capital for a number of very good reasons. How should we think about the full year free cash flow? And is there any reason, again, you're not sort of in that 115%, 120% conversion as it relates to net income for the full year?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I think for the full year, Ken, we should be around those historic benchmarks. You're correct, first six months of this year, we have invested quite a bit in working capital to get to support the business. And maybe we invest a little bit more as the year goes on. If the revenues continue on pace with what we think they'll do. But I do think our conversion will be strong this year.\nKen Herbert: Okay, excellent. I'll stop there and pass it back. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: We have the line of Josh Sullivan from Benchmark. Your line is open. Josh Sullivan, your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Sorry. That was on mute. Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: Just on the acceleration of adoption of new products you mentioned, the market share gains, are you seeing new customer types either geographically or by airline business model, any entities, which historically were more hands off coming forward in this environment?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we say, we deal with every airline \u2013 virtually every airline out there, they're all customers of ours, but the answer to that is yes, they are adopting a broader range of product much more so than they ever have in the past. So yes, I think while we are not adding \u2013 it's not so much as adding customer names, we are broadening significantly what they're buying from us.\nJosh Sullivan: And then just one on the M&A front, in the past, you noted private equity was driving up target valuations, obviously interest rate environment, market environment have changed. Do you think you'll see less interest from private equity and more competition from strategics going forward?\nEric Mendelson: I certainly hope we're going to see less competition from private equity. As far as strategics, I think HEICO has a unique value proposition and for the seller who really wants a good home for the business, a good partner wants to take care of the team members, wants to treat the customers right. There is no better option than to partner with HEICO, period, bar none, we are by far the best option for that type of seller. And I think the trick is frankly finding that type of seller who isn\u2019t greedy and who wants to do the right thing, because you can\u2019t get blood from a stone. And frankly, shame on the seller who doesn\u2019t care about his or her people, and doesn\u2019t care about the customers and is just greedy and wants to take every penny they possibly can. And typically when private equity wins it\u2019s because of that and that trade off. So I think that we are \u2013 we offer a very unique proposition also for leadership teams. The HEICO model is incredibly motivational. And when we find good people who know what they\u2019re doing, we don\u2019t come up with the \u2013 all of this horse crap buzzwords from the corporate office, like so many companies do. And we instead let them focus on their business. We get on the same page, we get into the weeds and the detail, we understand exactly how they\u2019re operating and we\u2019re here to support them. And it works extremely well. So I personally am very optimistic. Yeah. I mean, can corporate acquirers end up paying more money? Well, they\u2019re also going to have to pay higher interest rates, and then they\u2019ve got to deal with the intangible amortization as do we. So I hope that they are restrained in what they do. But I\u2019m very optimistic. We\u2019re very competitive. I mean, nobody sells to us at a ridiculously lower price than they sell it to somebody else. I mean, we\u2019re obviously always competitive if we buy companies. And we\u2019re really busy right now. So I\u2019m very optimistic that the trend will continue.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay. Well, thank you for that.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: We have Greg Konrad from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nGreg Konrad: Maybe just Eric to start. I mean, I know we\u2019ve touched on this a bunch, but just when you think about the recovery and kind of the data that we see around traffic regionally, or narrow body versus wide body. Relative to your business, I mean, any surprises in terms of some of those areas or platforms that are maybe recovering faster than the broader market.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. And Greg, as a matter of fact, I remember Sheila asking me, I don\u2019t remember if it was on the last call or the call before that, did I think narrow body was going to recover in North America in 2022? And I don\u2019t recall the exact words I used. But I said, I\u2019d rather see the data and let it come out. And I didn\u2019t want to get in front of something like that. But clearly, North America narrow body is doing extremely well. And frankly, I am shocked as to the pace of recovery at HEICO. And I think we are recovering \u2013 we have recovered quicker than the industry. And I\u2019m \u2013 and there are a whole bunch of areas that haven\u2019t seen so much recovery. So I\u2019m very optimistic. But yes, I mean, the narrow body is the strength, North America is obviously the center of that strength. Europe is recovering, but it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. Asia is still struggling. South America is in the process of recovering. It\u2019s sort of more like Europe. But yes, North Americans are just itching to fly. So I think we\u2019re doing very well in that market.\nGreg Konrad: And then maybe one for Victor. In your opening remarks, you talked about the defense weakness kind of being in line with peers and the industry overall, I think is expected to tick up in the second half of the year, whether it\u2019s supply chain being alleviated some of the \u2013 getting the budget in place or even some tick up from just supplementals tied to Ukraine. I mean any commentary kind of leaking the booking commentary that you had with maybe how you expect conversion in the second half of the year. And would you expect to defense overall to maybe improve in the second half of your fiscal year?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Greg, I\u2019m going to be very cautious on this because there have just been more surprises I think this year in the last 12 months than usual. One would generally be encouraged by healthy bookings. But we have six months, right, the back half of the year is six months. So I\u2019m just not sure. And I\u2019m not trying to be evasive, but I prefer to wait and see how it all falls out.\nGreg Konrad: And then just a quick clean up question for Carlos. I mean, any update to the tax plus non-controlling interest rate for the year.\nCarlos Macau: Hey, Greg, I\u2019ll give you my cleanup comment. The tax and NCI rate should be between 25% to 27%. I expect as Larry mentioned in his comments, we had about a 3% headwind on our tax rate for market declines in tax exempt securities we hold in life insurances products. That\u2019s a wild card. The market keeps going down that could adversely affect our rate. I\u2019m expecting, let\u2019s say anywhere from 18% to 19% in a tax rate and somewhere between 7% and 8% in NCI rate of pre-tax income, percentage of pre-tax income as of right now.\nGreg Konrad: Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Peter Skibitski from Olympic Global. Your line is open.\nPeter Skibitski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully you can hear me I\u2019m traveling and I\u2019m on my mobile.\nLaurans Mendelson: We can hear you well.\nPeter Skibitski: Great. Just I was wondering if you could drill down a little more into defense and ETG sales a bit. I\u2019m just wondering as DoD kind of really goes full speed ahead on kind of next generation R&D efforts like, we touched on space, but also hypersonics. You\u2019ve got new aircraft efforts like NGA that are getting a lot of money and even some of the procurement efforts like F-35 will be well funded for a while. I\u2019m just wondering how you feel HEICO is positioned in these areas especially the R&D type spend areas. And do you kind of feel overall like you\u2019re well aligned with where DoD is going? Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: It\u2019s good question, Pete. The answer is definitely we feel very well aligned with where the DoD is going. And you\u2019ve heard us talk about this over the years that we\u2019ve tried to construct the business in such a way that we\u2019re not just reliant on the operations tempo, and we\u2019re trying to be in the higher technology areas that offer that future growth and the higher tech solutions and a lot of engineering. And so, as you saw, we\u2019re spending money on the R&D side and product development side. So I would \u2013 I feel very good about that. The timing of course is always very difficult to anticipate. But we\u2019re going to continue making those investments because over time the yield results.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Maybe just one last one for me, switch into FSG. I\u2019m just wondering in the repair and overhaul group, it seems like there is labor tightness in the U.S., and it seems like that would be maybe one of your more blue collar focused areas. I\u2019m just wondering, if any trouble, sourcing labor there, or if you\u2019re seeing in an over average amount of wage pressure in that group. So just wanted to get any color you can provide there.\nLaurans Mendelson: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. And obviously repair and overhaul is more labor intensive typically than parts as a total percentage of sales. We do have job openings in that market but we\u2019ve been able to figure out and how to get it done. I mean, we\u2019ve treated our people extremely well. They\u2019re very happy about the work environment, about the amount of autonomy that they\u2019ve gotten in doing their jobs. They, I think feel very, very much appreciated. I\u2019ve actually heard stories about some people who unfortunately were offered more money by competitors and they go over to the competitor for the additional money. And then we hear back from them very quickly saying, oh, I made a terrible mistake. That they, frankly, they don\u2019t operate in the same way that HEICO does. And please, please, can I come back? So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape. We\u2019re in pretty good shape. Yes. There are openings and we\u2019re watching it, we\u2019re watching it very, very carefully. And we take care of our people and we see that if there are areas where costs are going up, we're very proactive in making sure that our people remain whole and that we take care of them and that they're proud to be at HEICO. And frankly, they're the reason for our success. So we're in pretty good shape in that area.\nPeter Skibitski: Great. Thanks for the color.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you. Thanks, Pete.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have this Pete Esterline from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nPete Esterline: Hey, good morning. I am on for Michael Ciarmoli this morning. Thanks for taking our questions. First I just wanted to ask what are you seeing in terms of inventory levels at airline customers, has there been any significant restocking activity from customers so far this year? And are you anticipating that you might see any over the next couple of quarters?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. So I've asked that question because, I anticipated it would come up. And the answer is our people don't really see restocking to-date. What they do see is return to service. So obviously there have been some aircraft that have been parked and those aircrafts have to get returned to service and they require parts. So we have seen that, but we haven't seen what we believe is their traditional \u201crestocking\u201d. So that's \u2013 and I've asked that question 10 different ways from many, many different people and that's what seems to be coming back. So I believe that's the case.\nPete Esterline: All right. Great, thanks. And then I also just wanted to ask on your specialty products business, how is that trending? Are you seeing sequential recovery there? And are you seeing any increased interest from customers on your Build to Spec offerings that might translate into increased market share going forward?\nEric Mendelson: We're doing really, really well in specialty products. And that's the area that we said would always be lagging because that's more of an OEM support business where we support OEMs. So I have to tell you a little anecdote. I was visiting one of our specialty products, businesses about two weeks ago, and our partner who owns a chunk of the business. And his leadership team thanked me because they said, you know, two years ago, we were really looking into the biz, where our customers were canceling borders, because they were not delivering aircraft, airlines didn't want new aircraft. Things were absolutely terrible. And they wanted to cut employment and I fleeted with them and said, look we operate a decentralized structure. You can do what, it's your business, you can run it the way you want, but I am begging you please do not do that, maintain the people, because we are going to need them in order to rebound. And I have to say this leadership team of this company is never afraid to call me out if they disagree with me on anything. And they were so thankful that they followed that advice, they said don't worry about the hit that we're going to take. It's okay. And we need to be there. We need \u2013 if we don't have this team, there's no way we're going to be able to service them. And they hung onto the people and now their business is surging. And without those people, we wouldn't have been able to do that. So I think we're \u2013 our strategy and the only way that we can do that of course is we're not loaded with debt. And we treat people right. Everything is the long game at HEICO, so that's why I think, frankly, the numbers are where they are and there's more to come on the upside there.\nPete Esterline: Great. Thanks a lot for the color.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have your next question from Louis Raffetto from UBS. Your line is open.\nLouis Raffetto: Thank you. Good morning guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Louis.\nLouis Raffetto: Carlos, I'm gonna go to you first with a couple of quick ones. The accrued contingent consideration just, was that a focused in ETG or FSG? I think there was a\u2026\nCarlos Macau: Sure. There's a little bit of a benefit from the discount rate in the quarter. That was split between both segments pretty evenly. The discount rate for volume is liabilities went up from 4% to 6% on average for us and so that 2% did have an incremental benefit to the company, which by the way, we haven't seen that in a while. So as the rates rise, those liabilities get discounted. And that's why you see that in the cash flow statement, $1.7 million or $1.8 million.\nLouis Raffetto: That makes sense. Perfect. Thank you. And then a similarly there was a $9 million, $10 million outflow in the, I guess investing activities under other just was curious what that was?\nLaurans Mendelson: Yeah. The majority of that was related to a deposit on a product line acquisition that we're almost complete with. And so for timely reasons, we made that deposit. We're still doing some investigative work, but it's a small product line we're looking to buy. That's why you see it come in and investing activities as an outflow.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then Eric, I'm going to go back to you. So I guess I heard some of that margin, some of the goodness in the quarter was a bit on mix, maybe a little bit of mismatch on sort of pricing increases versus cost increases, but I know you said there's no one-time, so there's no reversals of any of those old bad debt expenses or inventory reserves or anything like that from a few, a couple of years ago?\nEric Mendelson: No, it is all clean and I'm glad you mentioned that. This is something which I am really proud about HEICO and I talk about this with our people all the time. If you look at our peers out there, most of our peers, if not, all of them took these big one-time charges, where they repositioned, they wrote off inventory, they did receivables, all sorts of stuff, HEICO never did that. And we've never done that in the history of operating this business. There are all sorts of people out there who make uneconomical decisions in order to goose short-term earn, HEICO does not do that. And if you look at our numbers it supports that, without taking these one-time charges. So to answer your question, no, it was not a reversal of inventory or receivables or something like that. And as far as pricing goes we've been, as I said, we've been very careful to make sure that we pass along our cost increases and we maintain our margins. So I don't think that there \u2013 I think it\u2019d be incorrect to say that there's been a mismatch in terms of pricing and costs, because yes, there are some areas where we were able to realize higher sales prices due to costs going up. And we had inventory at a lower cost, but I can also tell you that there are plenty of other areas where due to contracts we were not able to realize higher sales prices when costs went up. So I wouldn't draw that conclusion that our margins were driven because of that. I mean, we're operating in a very lean environment. Our people are working exceptionally hard. I think our cost base coming out of COVID is lower than it was and so that's really the benefit that we're seeing flow through the margins.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. That's great color. Appreciate it, Eric. And then Larry, I guess maybe one for you, and if it's Eric's point on uneconomical obviously it was a recent deal sort of for a brakes business, went out at 14 times. Is that something you guys had looked at just not worth 14 times?\nLaurans Mendelson: Look, the answer is we really don't comment on things that we look at or I think that paying 14 times for anything I think is a pretty high price, but it's up to the buyer. If he makes it work god bless him, let him buy it. I mean, some people are paying 17 times. So we don't do that because we are much more conservative and we'll buy something that's accretive. And, you know, I mean, historically our style, we'll buy very good companies, but we're not going to reach up to the moon. The real question is in hindsight, what did these 14, 17 time acquisition deals do for the accretion of the buying company? That in my opinion that sort of gets lost in the weeds, that's yesterday's news. We can't live like that. Remember we're the, basically the larger shareholders and we can't wait 25 or 30 years to get a payback on our investment. So that's, that's not our model. But if somebody else wants to buy it, I mean, I think they're worth, they happen to be very good companies, but the question is, how much do you pay for it?\nEric Mendelson: And the other thing Louis, this is Eric that I would add is that, we're very busy with acquisitions. We obviously pay competitive prices, but we're very busy. And in general, I would say, people should know, if there's something for sale, we see most of everything, which is for sale. I mean, we\u2019re the go-to buyer for a lot of companies, but we\u2019ve got various priorities and we\u2019ve got to do what really makes the most sense for HEICO. And I want to be careful if someone\u2019s paying a higher price, they probably see a good path to realizing very good value, but we\u2019ve got to focus in \u2013 focus on the acquisitions, which are most meaningful to HEICO. One other thing I have learned, I have been told by many experts in Wall Street and M&A that roughly 20% of acquisitions are successful, 80% of acquisitions really failed. But nobody puts out a press release to announce that we bought a pig in the poke and got stuck. So HEICO has made and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m not politically correct. I\u2019m telling you what I really believe. And I know that the M&A world knows that roughly 80% of acquisitions don\u2019t work. So I\u2019m not going to buy into the greater fool theory because I want to see my salary double from $1 million to $2 million and so forth. My family\u2019s money and our investors\u2019 money is hard on the line. And I want to see you payback before I die and wait 50 years to get my money back. So that\u2019s the way HEICO is structured. And the other thing is, if you look at the market acceptance of HEICO and the multiple that we sell at, it appears that a lot of investors appreciate what we do. And I\u2019ve gotten letter today, we get incredible letters on the earnings. I don\u2019t want to make them public, but many investors have sent us thank you notes by email this morning saying how they appreciate the way we run the company. And so again, we\u2019re not going to pay 14 or 16. There\u2019s one example where we would pay 14. And if we were absolutely convinced that they have a backlog or orders that would support the future being at nine or 10 or something like that, or whatever in that case, we might pay 14 on trailing. But in general, you\u2019ve heard me say, I want to get the money back within hopefully seven to 10 years. And that\u2019s how we get our strong cash flow. We\u2019re not up to our neck into debt. And when tough times come around, we don\u2019t get calls from banks and we don\u2019t have to sell debt at 8%. So, I mean, that\u2019s our strategy. And does that answer your question?\nLouis Raffetto: Yes, we appreciate the honesty.\nLaurans Mendelson: Do you agree with it or do you disagree with me?\nLouis Raffetto: No. Larry, no one can disagree with what you\u2019ve \u2013 what the family has built over the last 30 years there and how successful it\u2019s been.\nLaurans Mendelson: That\u2019s the right answer.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks, Louis.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have your next question from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I was just curious if you\u2019ve seen any change in the pace of FAA approvals for your PMA parts pipeline, has that changed at all over the last couple years?\nLaurans Mendelson: No. It has not changed. Our pace of approvals continues. And we have a very good relationship. We built up a lot of confidence over the years and we\u2019re doing great there. By the way, I\u2019m going to add one other bit of color. People internally and other engineers who have come to look at HEICO and see how we run our PMA analysis have said to us that we really overkill with the development of parts that we go to extremes to make sure they\u2019re correct and accurate, and probably cost us more money to do that. And I think that\u2019s a very good and we believe that\u2019s a very good investment. I think the FAA understands that too, that the extent to which we go to develop parts and the detail and the duplication and so forth. So we get it right. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s in our DNA. And I think the quality \u2013 remember HEICO in general, has to develop and sell quality parts. We can\u2019t sell junk to go on spacecrafts and the electronics don\u2019t work. We have to have parts that work and aircraft engines and everything else. So quality is absolutely number one. And we will overspend to get that quality. And that\u2019s very, very important to us.\nGautam Khanna: That\u2019s helpful. And then just, maybe Eric, could you remind us how much of FSG sales in a normal year are derived from the Chinese market? And I\u2019m just curious if you saw any slowdown, given other lockdowns and what have you in the quarter related to that region?\nLaurans Mendelson: Yes, we don\u2019t disclose for competitive reasons and we are active in China. We do not have any manufacturing sites in China, but we are active in China. We sell into that market and I would say we\u2019re doing just fine.\nGautam Khanna: And did you see any slowdown in the quarter related to the air traffic [ph] or were they continuing to buy?\nLaurans Mendelson: I am reluctant to reply to that because I really need to study it by business units. Sometimes you can have, I wouldn\u2019t want you to form the wrong opinion. Sometimes sales can be lumpy due to a big inventory purchase in one quarter or another. So I wouldn\u2019t say in looking at the China market that you could really get a sense looking from one quarter to the other.\nGautam Khanna: Fair enough. And then just, maybe do you guys have a high level view on any sort of Ukraine-Russia exposure, i.e., sales that will be lost as a result of that?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. This is Victor. We did have some sales in Ukraine and Russia in the ETG. So that\u2019s actually a headwind for us. I mean, it\u2019s not overwhelming, it\u2019s sort of in the neighborhood of maybe kind of 1% of sales headwind, I think probably on an ongoing basis is total potential, something like that.\nEric Mendelson: And I would say within the Flight Support, the group does, the numbers would be similar.\nGautam Khanna: Great. Thank you very much guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no more questions. I will turn the call back to the speakers for further remarks. Please go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: This is Larry Mendelson, again. It\u2019s been a long call and a lot of excellent questions. I hope we\u2019ve been able to satisfy you with the answers, if not where to reach us, give us a call at any time. We\u2019ll try to be very responsive. I thank you for your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking with you when we do our third quarter earnings call, which will be sometime in middle to late August. So with that, this is the end of the call and we wish you a very, very good day and hopefully a strong stock market to return.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Good morning. This is Carlos. I would just add real quickly to that. Keep in mind; we've been thinking about the FSG, approaching this 20% OI level. The road or the path to getting there is going to be a little lumpy because as the businesses return to volume levels that we've seen in the past, different parts of the FSG grow at different rates. And so that's going to affect our margin during the quarter. So that's why, for the year, I would think about it along the 20% range and recognize that it's going to be lumpy up and down to get there. Yes, Gautam. I think the PMA business, the parts business, have all been very strong and consistently strong where we saw a little bit of a tailwind, which we expected and we talked about last quarter was the return of our Specialty Products Group. Their volumes have picked up as we thought they would. Their volumes tend to be tied, to the OEM market. And as you probably notice across the board, that's coming back a little bit. So that's helped us, but the, I'd say the rate, especially products increases a little higher than it had been historically, which did have a mix impact if you would, on the margin. That's about the only thing... That's a good question. As Eric mentioned, we have, we do have a bit of a delay. It's not like this is instantaneous. Any of our price increases. It does come in phases over time. As we renegotiate contracts and discuss with our customers, the ongoing relationship that doesn't happen instantaneously. So I don't know that this quarter, we saw a huge impact from pricing. But nonetheless, I think, it will continue. And we will, as Eric said, we'll cover our cost increases. We'll do our best to cover our cost increases, but we're not raising prices as an effort to boost margins and things like that. We're trying to be very friendly to our customers. Again, it's a long term strategy, so. Thank you. Yes. I think during \u2013 first of all, we're structurally very entrepreneurial. We have a lot of different subsidiaries and managers running those facilities that have their roots as a sole proprietor and entrepreneur. And so they know how to adjust because when they learn how to manage that business, it was their wallet, their checkbook, right. And I think those tenants have benefited HEICO throughout this process. There is no doubt that inflation is part of the equation and I think that our guys have done an exceptional job at managing that cost. And then also to what Eric mentioned earlier, we've done a pretty good job of working with our customers to cover the increased costs as best we can. So I think the whole equation at HEICO because of our structure allows us to make that happen. Thanks, Larry. Well, I think for the full year, Ken, we should be around those historic benchmarks. You're correct, first six months of this year, we have invested quite a bit in working capital to get to support the business. And maybe we invest a little bit more as the year goes on. If the revenues continue on pace with what we think they'll do. But I do think our conversion will be strong this year. Thanks Ken. Hey, Greg, I'll give you my cleanup comment. The tax and NCI rate should be between 25% to 27%. I expect as Larry mentioned in his comments, we had about a 3% headwind on our tax rate for market declines in tax exempt securities we hold in life insurances products. That's a wild card. The market keeps going down that could adversely affect our rate. I'm expecting, let's say anywhere from 18% to 19% in a tax rate and somewhere between 7% and 8% in NCI rate of pre-tax income, percentage of pre-tax income as of right now. You're welcome. Sure. There's a little bit of a benefit from the discount rate in the quarter. That was split between both segments pretty evenly. The discount rate for volume is liabilities went up from 4% to 6% on average for us and so that 2% did have an incremental benefit to the company, which by the way, we haven't seen that in a while. So as the rates rise, those liabilities get discounted. And that's why you see that in the cash flow statement, $1.7 million or $1.8 million."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $237.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $243.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $459.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to $466.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The net sales decreased in both periods is mainly attributable to decreased demand for our defense products, partially offset by increased demand for our space, medical, other electronics and telecommunications products, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. Like many other defense industry suppliers, our defense product sales declined during the first half of 2022. As to the usual question of whether lower defense sales change or the defense sales change rather was concentrated in a single product. I would say that our defense sales change trends were essentially consistent and we're more or less proportionate in our various businesses and products, which isn't surprising is that it seems in phase with the rest of the industry. As we've explained over the years, our defense product sales tend to be uneven, which doesn't worry us given our excellent position supplying components on a wide assortment of programs and our healthy order flow and backlog, so we remain excited about both our long-term defense sales growth prospects and growth in the products and services we sell in other markets. Though, we all wish it weren't the case, and we wish that piece would reign over our planet. We are convinced that increasing global tensions and risks means the need for our defense products and services will continue to rise over time. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $66 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to $71.3 million in the second quarter, fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $121.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to $131.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating income decrease in fiscal 2022 second quarter, and first six months principally reflects lower efficiency levels resulting from the previously mentioned defense sales decrease and a lower gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned, decrease in defense product net sales and increase new product research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in order to support important and ongoing new product development activities.  The Electronic Technology Group's operating margin was 27.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to 29.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Electronic Technology Group's operating margin was 26.4% in the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to 28.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The lower operating margin in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned lower efficiency level, as well as the previously mentioned, lower gross profit margin.  I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes, Gautam. It's a good question. Actually, our book-to-bill ratio and our orders are very strong and book-to-bill accelerated for us both in the first quarter of the year, the second quarter of the year, sort of entire first half versus last year, so that remains strong. Of course, like everybody else, we've got these miscellaneous supply chain challenges, which were greater and seem to be accelerating. They're not overwhelming us fortunately, but they are accelerating and that that probably contributes to the book-to-bill ratio even more than it usually does. But as far as we're looking at it book-to-bill is accelerating and strong. You're welcome. Larry, I think, overall, that dynamic does have an effect on us, yes. And it does slow things down. I would say more pronounced is the situation where our customers are not getting products on order because they can't get it out of their factory or they don't have people, people working from home. And so in a number of instances or a few of our subsidiaries, I should say, had mentioned that to us as an issue and that has been actually happening for a while. And at some point, of course, that will even out and we should ship all that. And we get those orders that we're expecting and you hear the customers say things like it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, but we just can't take any more in the factory or in our plant or out of space, et cetera, et cetera. So expect the order a month or two or three or whatever later. So, this is Victor. I'll give you a perspective for the ETG companies. Lead times from suppliers continue to increase. There are lead times that are out for some components as far as, believe it or not, over 100 weeks. That's the exception though fortunately not the rule. We have generally, of course, found workarounds around those. And as you know, our inventory approach has been such that we've really minimized the effect of that. But I would expect this to continue to be a challenge. I would expect it to continue to accelerate a little bit. I would say that I think on our last conference call, I estimated that we had sort of in the $10 million range that had slipped from one quarter into the next quarter and I would say that's probably 50%, 70% more in this quarter that we just finished than it was in the prior quarter. And so again, you're talking about a few percent of sales, not overwhelming, but certainly something actually our growth would have been considerably higher or somewhat higher had we not dealt with that. But we'll continue to let our companies address those and keep it down to sort of a low simmer as they would say, rather than a more fire. Thank you. And this is Victor, for ETG, the effect the recession would have, it's fairly muted typically for us because we have a high proportion coming from defense and space and medical combined, those markets, which tend not to suffer like the broader economy does in a recession. Now our general markets where we serve certain high end electronics that might feel an impact and commercial aviation, depending on what happens with travel. But at this point, by the way, we are not seeing that. And interestingly enough, our orders in our non-A&D markets, which I very often look at as a precursor to overall economic activity have remained strong and remain healthy. So at this point, it seems to be business as usual. Yeas, so our space business, as you know, is really focused on what I would call the high end in space. We're not on micro SATs very much. We don't chase those markets. We try to pursue and we've been successful pursuing the very highly engineered high end, very often radiation tolerant or radiation hardened solution. So for bigger, if you will, more expensive satellites but not entirely and that's a part of it. So what we're not doing is we're not chasing after this kind of explosion in everything space and I think our opportunities will continue to be in the higher end, more highly engineered products. And that's really where we're looking to expand as opposed to just sort of picking up revenue at any old margin to us. Our view is if it's a healthy margin, then it means we're adding some important value to the customer. And if it's low margin, then we're probably \u2013 we'd be looking at something that's more commoditized or they feel they could get elsewhere. You're welcome. Good morning, Ken. Yes. Greg, I'm going to be very cautious on this because there have just been more surprises I think this year in the last 12 months than usual. One would generally be encouraged by healthy bookings. But we have six months, right, the back half of the year is six months. So I'm just not sure. And I'm not trying to be evasive, but I prefer to wait and see how it all falls out. Yes. This is Victor. We did have some sales in Ukraine and Russia in the ETG. So that's actually a headwind for us. I mean, it's not overwhelming, it's sort of in the neighborhood of maybe kind of 1% of sales headwind, I think probably on an ongoing basis is total potential, something like that."

            "content": "Thank you very much and good morning to everyone on this call. Thank you for joining us and we welcome you to this HEICO second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a few minutes to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another outstanding quarter. Your dedication to our customers and operational excellence has translated into superior results for the shareholders. I am truly delighted by the positive trends in our aerospace business, and I am optimistic that these favorable trends will continue during the remainder of fiscal 2022. I will summarize the highlights of our second quarter fiscal 2022 record results. Consolidated second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 operating income represents record results for HEICO and that was driven principally by record operating income within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from a continued rebound in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 improved 27% and 15% respectively as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. These results mainly reflect a 9% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the favorable impact from our fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions.  Consolidated operating margin improved to 22.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that was up from 20.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. And it improved to 21.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2022. And that was up from 20% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 87% and 33% in operating income and net sales respectively, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. These results principally reflect strong 31% quarterly organic growth for commercial aerospace parts and services. In addition, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group. Our total debt to shareholders' equity was 11% as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 10.3% as of October 31, 2021. Our net debt, which is total debt, less cash and cash equivalent of $148.6 million as of April 30, 2022, compared to shareholders' equity ratio was 6.1% as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 5.6% as of October 31, 2021. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.28x and 0.26x as of April 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021. We have no significant debt majorities until fiscal 2025. And we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes in order to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder return. I'd like to discuss our recent acquisition activity, which in March 2022, we acquired all of the stock of Flight Microwave Corporation, which is a designer and manufacturer of custom high power filters and filter assemblies used in space and defense applications. In March 2022, we successfully completed the previously announced agreement to acquire 74% of the membership interest of Pioneer Industries. And Pioneer is a specialty distributor of spares for military, aviation, Marine and ground platforms. The remaining 26% interest continues to be owned by certain members of Pioneer's management team. We expect both of these acquisitions to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 22% to $0.62 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and that was up nicely from $0.51 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 21% to a $1.25 in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that was also up nicely from a $1.03 in the first six months of fiscal 2021.  The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher consolidated operating income. Depreciation and amortization expense, totaled $23.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, that was up from $22.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and totaled $46.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, again, up from $45.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. Significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both ETG and Flight Support and this is critical for the development of new products and technologies that will fuel our future growth. R&D expense increased to $18.8 million or 3.5% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that was up from $18 million or 3.9% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. R&D expense increased to $37.1 million or 3.6% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and again, up from $34.2 million or 3.9% of net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2021. SG&A expenses were $88.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $83 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and that was an increase of $5.5 million.  The increase in consolidated SG&A expense principally reflects a $3.4 million attributable to our fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions and an increase of $3.1 million in selling expense to support the previously mentioned sales growth. And that was partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in G&A expenses. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $179.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to $161.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. Again, the increase in consolidate SG&A expense, principally reflects costs incurred to support the previously mentioned net sales growth, and that resulted in increases of $6.3 million and $6.1 million in general, administrative and selling expenses respectively, plus $6.3 million attributable to our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. Interest expense decreased to $1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and that was down from $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Interest expense decreased to $1.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that was down from $4.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The decrease in both quarters was principally due to lower weighted average balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. And that reflects our strong cash flow from operations, which we use to pay down borrowings. Other income in both quarters in the first six months of 2022 and 2021 was not significant. HEICO's effective tax rate was 23.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. And that compared to 19.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. HEICO's effective tax rate was 15% in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to 12% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate in the second quarter and it's first six months of fiscal 2022, principally reflects an unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO leadership compensation plan as compared to the tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized on such policies in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021. The impact of these unrealized losses accounted for an increase of about 3% in our second quarter tax rate and reflect recent overall stock market declines. As we discussed in last quarter's teleconference, HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 of $17.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, resulting from strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option lease holding period. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $15.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022 and that compared to $11.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects improved operating results of certain subsidiaries of the flight support group in which noncontrolling interests are held. And that's inclusive of fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. For the full fiscal 2022 year, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of 20 \u2013 between 25% and 27% of pre-tax income. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain extremely strong. Cash flow provided for operating \u2013 by operating activities was $96.8 million and $194.8 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022, respectively, as compared to a $102.9 million and $210.1 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2021. During 2022, we invested approximately $87 million in working capital. And the change in working capital includes a $43 million increase to inventories, and that reflects a strategic decision to increase inventory purchases within our distribution businesses and to support an increase in our consolidated backlog. In addition, receivables increased $20 million resulting from our net sales growth. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities have decreased by $16 million principally due to timing. Our working capital ratio improved to 3.4 times as of April 30. And that was up from 3.2 at times as of October 31, 2021. Our DSOs, day sales outstanding was 45 days as of April 30, 2022. And that compared to 41 days as of April 30, 2021. We closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit credit risk exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales and our top five customers represented approximately 21% and 23% of consolidated net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our inventory turnover rate decreased to 150 days where the period ended April 30, 2022. And that was down from 153 days where the period ended April 30, 2021. Now for the outlook, we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2022, and we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery. Despite the potential for additional pandemic variance, we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of pandemic vaccines, including boosters will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve, but it still remains very difficult to predict the pandemic's path and effect, including factors like new variants and vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions, and inflation, which can impact our key markets.  Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2022 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing conservative policies, strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of periodic strategic inventory, purchasing opportunities and execute on our successful acquisition program, which all of which collectively position HEICO for future market share gains. In closing, I would like to, again thank our incredible team members for their support and commitment to HEICO. They are the ones that make HEICO tick and grow. And we are very, very proud of our entire team. The remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond looks very promising for HEICO and to me personally. And we thank you all for making HEICO, the great company that it is. That is the extent of our prepared remarks, and I would like to open the floor to questions. Good morning. Good Morning. Thank you. Thanks. Good morning. We can hear you well. Yes. That's a good question. And obviously repair and overhaul is more labor intensive typically than parts as a total percentage of sales. We do have job openings in that market but we've been able to figure out and how to get it done. I mean, we've treated our people extremely well. They're very happy about the work environment, about the amount of autonomy that they've gotten in doing their jobs. They, I think feel very, very much appreciated. I've actually heard stories about some people who unfortunately were offered more money by competitors and they go over to the competitor for the additional money. And then we hear back from them very quickly saying, oh, I made a terrible mistake. That they, frankly, they don't operate in the same way that HEICO does. And please, please, can I come back? So I think we're in pretty good shape. We're in pretty good shape. Yes. There are openings and we're watching it, we're watching it very, very carefully. And we take care of our people and we see that if there are areas where costs are going up, we're very proactive in making sure that our people remain whole and that we take care of them and that they're proud to be at HEICO. And frankly, they're the reason for our success. So we're in pretty good shape in that area. Thank you. Thanks, Pete. Good morning, Louis. Yeah. The majority of that was related to a deposit on a product line acquisition that we're almost complete with. And so for timely reasons, we made that deposit. We're still doing some investigative work, but it's a small product line we're looking to buy. That's why you see it come in and investing activities as an outflow. Look, the answer is we really don't comment on things that we look at or I think that paying 14 times for anything I think is a pretty high price, but it's up to the buyer. If he makes it work god bless him, let him buy it. I mean, some people are paying 17 times. So we don't do that because we are much more conservative and we'll buy something that's accretive. And, you know, I mean, historically our style, we'll buy very good companies, but we're not going to reach up to the moon. The real question is in hindsight, what did these 14, 17 time acquisition deals do for the accretion of the buying company? That in my opinion that sort of gets lost in the weeds, that's yesterday's news. We can't live like that. Remember we're the, basically the larger shareholders and we can't wait 25 or 30 years to get a payback on our investment. So that's, that's not our model. But if somebody else wants to buy it, I mean, I think they're worth, they happen to be very good companies, but the question is, how much do you pay for it? Do you agree with it or do you disagree with me? That's the right answer. Thanks, Louis. No. It has not changed. Our pace of approvals continues. And we have a very good relationship. We built up a lot of confidence over the years and we're doing great there. By the way, I'm going to add one other bit of color. People internally and other engineers who have come to look at HEICO and see how we run our PMA analysis have said to us that we really overkill with the development of parts that we go to extremes to make sure they're correct and accurate, and probably cost us more money to do that. And I think that's a very good and we believe that's a very good investment. I think the FAA understands that too, that the extent to which we go to develop parts and the detail and the duplication and so forth. So we get it right. And that's something that's in our DNA. And I think the quality \u2013 remember HEICO in general, has to develop and sell quality parts. We can't sell junk to go on spacecrafts and the electronics don't work. We have to have parts that work and aircraft engines and everything else. So quality is absolutely number one. And we will overspend to get that quality. And that's very, very important to us. Yes, we don't disclose for competitive reasons and we are active in China. We do not have any manufacturing sites in China, but we are active in China. We sell into that market and I would say we're doing just fine. I am reluctant to reply to that because I really need to study it by business units. Sometimes you can have, I wouldn't want you to form the wrong opinion. Sometimes sales can be lumpy due to a big inventory purchase in one quarter or another. So I wouldn't say in looking at the China market that you could really get a sense looking from one quarter to the other. Thank you. This is Larry Mendelson, again. It's been a long call and a lot of excellent questions. I hope we've been able to satisfy you with the answers, if not where to reach us, give us a call at any time. We'll try to be very responsive. I thank you for your interest in HEICO. And we look forward to speaking with you when we do our third quarter earnings call, which will be sometime in middle to late August. So with that, this is the end of the call and we wish you a very, very good day and hopefully a strong stock market to return."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 33% to $306.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from $230.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 35% to $579 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from $429.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The net sales increased in the second quarter in first six months of fiscal 2022, reflects strong organic growth of 23% and 26% respectively, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the second quarter in first six months of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 87% to a record $66.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from $35.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 93% to a record $118.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from $61.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating income increase in the second quarter and for six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects an improved gross profit margin mainly from the previously mentioned higher net sales across all product lines and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. By the way, just as an aside and not part of the scripted remarks, I have to say and congratulate the Fight Support team because frankly, two years after COVID began and created such problems for this industry. I personally am just in awe of these results and the performance of our team. I don't think anybody expected that we would be back to record numbers within two years after the COVID crisis happened. So I just cannot stress enough how outstanding I think these results are. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 21.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, up from 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 20.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2022, up from 14.3% in the first six months of fiscal 2021. The operating margin increased in the second quarter and for six months of fiscal 2022 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, as well as a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Yes, I think the way we, think about pricing is we want to maintain our margins. So our margin percentage at a minimum so, we've got to pass through our added costs, and we've got to add our margin on top of that. Having said that, our list prices often reflect what the \u2013 what our competitors are doing. However, when we've got long term committed customers, we've got contractual arrangements where we sell at a discount to that list price. And we don't take those increases, to the extent that we would necessarily raise our list prices. So it's, it really depends on the, the arrangement, but as you can see from our results, we believe that we've been able to successfully pass along our cost increases along with maintaining a reason, maintaining our profit margin while at the same time, keeping our customers happy. And I actually have to just add a little anecdote was at the MRO Conference in Dallas a couple of weeks ago. And actually we had a major airline that everybody would be very, very familiar with. I can't mention the name and they brought all of their senior leadership to frankly, thank HEICO. In all of my years, I've never had a meeting quite like this, where they brought their senior leadership to thank HEICO; One for coming up with our new product solutions and helping them with all sorts of stuff that others wouldn't. And number two, not taking advantage of them and not doing what other people are doing. And they called out a number of other manufacturers, and they said that HEICO really differentiated itself and was going to be rewarded with not only increased business on products that we currently offer, but increase business on a new stuff that they wanted us to develop for them. So I think as a result of treating our customers, right, this is going to work, we'll get our in summary, we'll get our costs covered, we'll maintain or grow our margins a little bit. And most importantly, we will keep our customers happy because there's a huge amount of opportunity for us. Yes. I wouldn't say that there's anything abnormal in the quarter. I want to be careful though, not to predict. I mean, what these numbers, I think our record operating margin percentage for the Flight Support Group, which frankly, I am amazed that in this environment with all that we're aware of, that we're able to keep our customers happy and record margins. So we will continue to watch that very carefully. I want to be careful because obviously we're going to be replenishing inventories. We have to see what that is. We're adding back some positions, growing our engineering talent. So I want to be careful to predict these higher margins. But I feel good about where we're headed. Yes. Larry, that's a great question. And I always get \u2013 I mean, I'm very involved with all the businesses, of course, but I always get prepared in the week before these conference calls to get sort of the latest information on what's going on in the ground \u2013 on the ground. And I can tell you that in all of our business areas in which Flight Support operates. We are, in my opinion, gaining market share. I have never seen \u2013 in my 32.5 years at HEICO, I have never seen this level of enthusiasm from our people. And it is absolutely across the board. It's in PMA parts, component repair, distribution, specialty manufacturing, defense sustainment. It is just completely across the board. And I think that it is as a result of us taking care of our people as times got tough, making sure that we maintained our inventory and actually grew our inventories to make sure that we could support our customers, the fact that we are not highly levered and we're able to make all decisions for the long haul of the fact that our leadership teams and our salespeople have been with the company for decades. I mean they know the HEICO mantra and they speak it as well as if not better than I do. So it is incredibly broad-based. It's in the aftermarket. It's in the OEM. It's in defense sustainment. It's all across our business. And honestly, it made me feel really, really good. Yes. I believe that they are long lasting. We've always spoken about how the trend is up and that we need to continue \u2013 look, we're not going to have a large impact on any of our competitors. Our gains are very, very broad-based, and they're incremental. We're doing very well. But I see just tremendous strength and, frankly, everything \u2013 all areas in which we operate. Yes. We're very active in the M&A area, incredibly busy, busier than we've ever been. We remain disciplined. We recognize that the market is where the market is, and we've got to be competitive. But yes, I think that there are plenty of opportunities and we're working them very, very aggressively. Yes. And Peter, with regard to the Flight Support side I think that we were smart. Our people were really intelligent to make sure that we had sufficient inventory coming into this. We're working very closely with our suppliers. Frankly, there's no shortage of orders for us. The challenge is going to be making sure that we get everything delivered on time. And I think there could be hiccups down the road. Our people tell me about problems and they ultimately figure out solutions to them. So I would say on high alert watching the inventory restocking issue, but I'm hopeful that we will figure out how to manage through it. It would be the latter, more of \u2013 a greater acceleration of adoption. I think we're very content with the pace of new product development. We've got a lot of unsold potential where people can save a lot more money, if they buy the rest of our product line. So I think our preference would be to get all that stuff sold first and then to increase the rate of new product development later. We are \u2013 we continually grow in adjacent, what I call adjacent white spaces. And so there's no change there, but we got to make sure that we get everything sold. And I think our current volume and rate of new product development is really very, very well optimized. We've got the chain balanced, if we increase new product development, then you got to increase procurement, manufacturing, inspection, sales, there's a lot of stuff that has to happen in order to support that. So I think we're really well balanced right now. Good morning. When you say recessionary impacts, you mean with the markets that turning down possibly in the future? Yes. I think we've picked up market share and we in a downturn continue to pick up market share. So I'm not afraid of it, frankly, whatsoever. We don't at the moment, see that kind of impact, there's no question there's deflationary issues when it comes to consumer products. And that's because for the last two years, people have bought a lot of that stuff, especially with all the money that the government has pumped out there and given to consumers. However, if you look, the savings levels are still pretty elevated. And the one thing that everybody wants to do today, they don't care whether they have COVID, they risk of getting COVID, nobody cares. They're all traveling, everybody's been cooped up. And I think that trend is going to continue. So I don't see that same historic two times GDP impact on air travel occurring over the next couple of years. I think we've paid a huge price in the past few years. And I think air travel is going to be relatively strong, X obviously Russia, Ukraine, China, I mean that there are some places that are going to see an impact. But I think with \u2013 insofar as how it's going to impact HEICO, we are so well ingrained at our customers and they view us \u2013 I can't stress it enough that they no longer view us as this tiny little $30 million company that we were 30 years ago. I mean, they view us as a real powerhouse and power player in the industry. So I think we're going to be the go to company, frankly. Good morning. Yes, I think I mean the booking trends are improving and so I expect continued growth in the third and fourth quarters. I think that we're grabbing market share. And I anticipate that we're going to continue to do very well in all of our businesses in the third and fourth quarters. Good morning. Yes, we say, we deal with every airline \u2013 virtually every airline out there, they're all customers of ours, but the answer to that is yes, they are adopting a broader range of product much more so than they ever have in the past. So yes, I think while we are not adding \u2013 it's not so much as adding customer names, we are broadening significantly what they're buying from us. I certainly hope we're going to see less competition from private equity. As far as strategics, I think HEICO has a unique value proposition and for the seller who really wants a good home for the business, a good partner wants to take care of the team members, wants to treat the customers right. There is no better option than to partner with HEICO, period, bar none, we are by far the best option for that type of seller. And I think the trick is frankly finding that type of seller who isn't greedy and who wants to do the right thing, because you can't get blood from a stone. And frankly, shame on the seller who doesn't care about his or her people, and doesn't care about the customers and is just greedy and wants to take every penny they possibly can. And typically when private equity wins it's because of that and that trade off. So I think that we are \u2013 we offer a very unique proposition also for leadership teams. The HEICO model is incredibly motivational. And when we find good people who know what they're doing, we don't come up with the \u2013 all of this horse crap buzzwords from the corporate office, like so many companies do. And we instead let them focus on their business. We get on the same page, we get into the weeds and the detail, we understand exactly how they're operating and we're here to support them. And it works extremely well. So I personally am very optimistic. Yeah. I mean, can corporate acquirers end up paying more money? Well, they're also going to have to pay higher interest rates, and then they've got to deal with the intangible amortization as do we. So I hope that they are restrained in what they do. But I'm very optimistic. We're very competitive. I mean, nobody sells to us at a ridiculously lower price than they sell it to somebody else. I mean, we're obviously always competitive if we buy companies. And we're really busy right now. So I'm very optimistic that the trend will continue. Thanks, Josh. Yes. And Greg, as a matter of fact, I remember Sheila asking me, I don't remember if it was on the last call or the call before that, did I think narrow body was going to recover in North America in 2022? And I don't recall the exact words I used. But I said, I'd rather see the data and let it come out. And I didn't want to get in front of something like that. But clearly, North America narrow body is doing extremely well. And frankly, I am shocked as to the pace of recovery at HEICO. And I think we are recovering \u2013 we have recovered quicker than the industry. And I'm \u2013 and there are a whole bunch of areas that haven't seen so much recovery. So I'm very optimistic. But yes, I mean, the narrow body is the strength, North America is obviously the center of that strength. Europe is recovering, but it hasn't fully recovered. Asia is still struggling. South America is in the process of recovering. It's sort of more like Europe. But yes, North Americans are just itching to fly. So I think we're doing very well in that market. It's good question, Pete. The answer is definitely we feel very well aligned with where the DoD is going. And you've heard us talk about this over the years that we've tried to construct the business in such a way that we're not just reliant on the operations tempo, and we're trying to be in the higher technology areas that offer that future growth and the higher tech solutions and a lot of engineering. And so, as you saw, we're spending money on the R&D side and product development side. So I would \u2013 I feel very good about that. The timing of course is always very difficult to anticipate. But we're going to continue making those investments because over time the yield results. Yeah. So I've asked that question because, I anticipated it would come up. And the answer is our people don't really see restocking to-date. What they do see is return to service. So obviously there have been some aircraft that have been parked and those aircrafts have to get returned to service and they require parts. So we have seen that, but we haven't seen what we believe is their traditional \u201crestocking\u201d. So that's \u2013 and I've asked that question 10 different ways from many, many different people and that's what seems to be coming back. So I believe that's the case. We're doing really, really well in specialty products. And that's the area that we said would always be lagging because that's more of an OEM support business where we support OEMs. So I have to tell you a little anecdote. I was visiting one of our specialty products, businesses about two weeks ago, and our partner who owns a chunk of the business. And his leadership team thanked me because they said, you know, two years ago, we were really looking into the biz, where our customers were canceling borders, because they were not delivering aircraft, airlines didn't want new aircraft. Things were absolutely terrible. And they wanted to cut employment and I fleeted with them and said, look we operate a decentralized structure. You can do what, it's your business, you can run it the way you want, but I am begging you please do not do that, maintain the people, because we are going to need them in order to rebound. And I have to say this leadership team of this company is never afraid to call me out if they disagree with me on anything. And they were so thankful that they followed that advice, they said don't worry about the hit that we're going to take. It's okay. And we need to be there. We need \u2013 if we don't have this team, there's no way we're going to be able to service them. And they hung onto the people and now their business is surging. And without those people, we wouldn't have been able to do that. So I think we're \u2013 our strategy and the only way that we can do that of course is we're not loaded with debt. And we treat people right. Everything is the long game at HEICO, so that's why I think, frankly, the numbers are where they are and there's more to come on the upside there. Thank you. No, it is all clean and I'm glad you mentioned that. This is something which I am really proud about HEICO and I talk about this with our people all the time. If you look at our peers out there, most of our peers, if not, all of them took these big one-time charges, where they repositioned, they wrote off inventory, they did receivables, all sorts of stuff, HEICO never did that. And we've never done that in the history of operating this business. There are all sorts of people out there who make uneconomical decisions in order to goose short-term earn, HEICO does not do that. And if you look at our numbers it supports that, without taking these one-time charges. So to answer your question, no, it was not a reversal of inventory or receivables or something like that. And as far as pricing goes we've been, as I said, we've been very careful to make sure that we pass along our cost increases and we maintain our margins. So I don't think that there \u2013 I think it'd be incorrect to say that there's been a mismatch in terms of pricing and costs, because yes, there are some areas where we were able to realize higher sales prices due to costs going up. And we had inventory at a lower cost, but I can also tell you that there are plenty of other areas where due to contracts we were not able to realize higher sales prices when costs went up. So I wouldn't draw that conclusion that our margins were driven because of that. I mean, we're operating in a very lean environment. Our people are working exceptionally hard. I think our cost base coming out of COVID is lower than it was and so that's really the benefit that we're seeing flow through the margins. And the other thing Louis, this is Eric that I would add is that, we're very busy with acquisitions. We obviously pay competitive prices, but we're very busy. And in general, I would say, people should know, if there's something for sale, we see most of everything, which is for sale. I mean, we're the go-to buyer for a lot of companies, but we've got various priorities and we've got to do what really makes the most sense for HEICO. And I want to be careful if someone's paying a higher price, they probably see a good path to realizing very good value, but we've got to focus in \u2013 focus on the acquisitions, which are most meaningful to HEICO. One other thing I have learned, I have been told by many experts in Wall Street and M&A that roughly 20% of acquisitions are successful, 80% of acquisitions really failed. But nobody puts out a press release to announce that we bought a pig in the poke and got stuck. So HEICO has made and that's the way I'm not politically correct. I'm telling you what I really believe. And I know that the M&A world knows that roughly 80% of acquisitions don't work. So I'm not going to buy into the greater fool theory because I want to see my salary double from $1 million to $2 million and so forth. My family's money and our investors' money is hard on the line. And I want to see you payback before I die and wait 50 years to get my money back. So that's the way HEICO is structured. And the other thing is, if you look at the market acceptance of HEICO and the multiple that we sell at, it appears that a lot of investors appreciate what we do. And I've gotten letter today, we get incredible letters on the earnings. I don't want to make them public, but many investors have sent us thank you notes by email this morning saying how they appreciate the way we run the company. And so again, we're not going to pay 14 or 16. There's one example where we would pay 14. And if we were absolutely convinced that they have a backlog or orders that would support the future being at nine or 10 or something like that, or whatever in that case, we might pay 14 on trailing. But in general, you've heard me say, I want to get the money back within hopefully seven to 10 years. And that's how we get our strong cash flow. We're not up to our neck into debt. And when tough times come around, we don't get calls from banks and we don't have to sell debt at 8%. So, I mean, that's our strategy. And does that answer your question? Thank you. And I would say within the Flight Support, the group does, the numbers would be similar."

As we begin the call, I turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.\nLaurans Mendelson: Polly, thank you, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us and welcome you to HEICO's first quarter fiscal '22 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into excellent results for shareholders and I'm encouraged by the steady improvement in the operating results over the past 18 months. I'm also optimistic that this trend will continue during the remainder of fiscal year -- this fiscal year. I will now summarize the highlights of the first quarter fiscal '22 results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 improved 23% and 17%, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21, driven mainly by our 13% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the favorable impact from our fiscal '21 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 103% and 37% in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21. These results principally reflect strong 48% quarterly organic growth for commercial aerospace parts and services. Additionally, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at Flight Support. Our total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 10.1% as of January 31, '22. And that was down slightly from 10.3% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt, which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, of $112.3 million at January 31, '22, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 4.8% as of January 31, '22 and that was down slightly from 5.6% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.22x as of January 31, '22 and down -- that was down slightly, again from 0.26x as of October 31, '21. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, that compared to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The decrease is principally attributable to an investment of $54.8 million in working capital, partially offset by $18 million increase in net income from consolidated operations. The investment in working capital includes $29.6 million increase in inventories which reflect strategic buys within distribution businesses and to support an increase in the consolidated backlog as well as a decrease in accrued expenses resulting from the payment of fiscal '21 accrued performance-based compensation. A little bit of color. We added to inventory, as you know, to prevent inventory shortages. So our companies would not be running out of stock and could complete their manufacturing and processes and ship. We think that, that was a very wise decision. In January '22, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.09 per share. This represented our 87th consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. In January '22, we reported that our Sierra Microwave subsidiary, designed and manufactured flight critical components in the James Webb Space Telescope, which is considered to be the premier observatory of the next decade. As always, we thank Sierra Microwave for their outstanding accomplishments, great quality and we take great pride in their involvement in this amazing feat. Moving over to recent acquisition activity; February 22, we announced Flight Support and entered into an agreement to acquire 74% of the membership interest of Pioneer Industries LLC, a specialty distributor of spares for military aviation, marine and ground platforms. The remaining 26% will continue to be owned by certain members of Pioneer's management team and closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal '22. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. My own comment, which was not prepared is that, in my own mind, this was a very timely acquisition because of the events taking place in Ukraine and possibly in the future in the Far East. We think our military budget clearly, I've read this morning, that Congress is probably going to pass some additional military budgets and I would not be surprised to see that. My comment is, that's a good idea. We continue to bet excellent M&A opportunities, which meet our high standards for acquisition. Due diligence is ongoing on many of these opportunities and I'm optimistic that we will be successful in closing additional transactions in fiscal '22, all of which I believe will be accretive to earnings. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 37% to $272.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from $199.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase reflects strong organic growth of 30% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 103% to $52.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from $25.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The operating income increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned net sales increase which was across all of our product lines. Additionally, the operating income increase reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and the benefit of SG&A efficiencies realized from higher net sales volume. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 19.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from 13% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin as well as a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales -- as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $222.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 which was comparable to the $223.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The Electronic Technologies Group experienced continued growth in medical and other electronics products net sales as well as from the impact from our fiscal '21 acquisitions, offset by a slight decrease in defense and space product net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22. As historically -- as has historically been the case, Electronic Technologies Group sales tend to be lumpy by quarter and we expect that this year's three remaining quarters sales will each be greater than the first quarter sales which were reduced as a result of many team members being out from work as the Omicron variant surged. We witnessed the same issue at both vendors and customers, particularly in January which delayed production, deliveries and orders at various subsidiaries. We expect these effects to be cured during the remainder of our year. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $60.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, mainly from an increase in new product research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to support ongoing new product and development activities as well as lower level of efficiencies on SG&A expenses during the quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to 26.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The lower operating income as a percent of net sales principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned reduced efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. I turn the discussion back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 24% to $0.63 in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up from $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned higher consolidated operating income. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $23.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up very slightly from $23 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Research and development; significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and Flight Support and this is critical for the development of new products and technologies that fuel our growth. R&D expense increased to $18.4 million or 3.8% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up from $16.2 million or 3.9% of sales -- net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $91.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $78.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. And that's in line with our large net sales growth and is inclusive of a $3.8 million higher corporate expense, mainly attributable to increased performance-based compensation expense as well as the suspension of corporate salary reductions as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 18.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that compared to 18.7% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, a slight drop. Interest expense decreased to $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, down from $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and that was due to lower weighted average borrowing balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '22 was not significant. HEICO's effective tax rate was 4.1% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that compared to 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The rate increase -- slight rate increase reflect an unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies relating to the HEICO leadership compensation plan during the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized on such policies in the first quarter of fiscal '21, partially offset by a larger tax benefit from stock option exercise recognized in the first quarter of fiscal '22. My comment on this, when we get into the details in the questions, some people have pointed out that the gain from year-to-year was a result of tax and so forth. And if you study -- dig deep into it, you'll see that the two tax provisions are fairly comparable. So we are really comparing apples and apples. So when you say the -- to analyze it, certain people have pointed out that it's all due to tax benefit. And in my opinion, that is definitely not the case and those people should clarify it with Carlos, who can explain it to them in more detail. HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal '22 and '21 and they were $17.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively and that resulted from strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option lease holding period. For those of you who are not familiar with the taxation of stock options, again, Carlos can get into the detail. But essentially, the recipient of the stock option when he exercises it pays ordinary income tax on the gain, whether he sells the stock or not. And the company takes a tax deduction for the opposite side for the gain. So that's how the company picks up this tax benefit. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22. That compared to $5.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, principally reflecting aggregate increase in the operating results of subsidiaries in which noncontrolling interests are held. Bottom line, noncontrolling interest-owned companies did very well. For the first full fiscal year '22, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of between 25% and 27% of pretax income. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow; our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain very strong. Working capital ratio improved to 3.6x as of January '22 -- January 31, '22 and that was up from 3.2x as of October 31, '21. Our accounts receivable days outstanding which we call DSOs, improved to 43 days as of January 31, '22 and that was down from 45 days as of January 31, '21. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales and our Top 5 customers represented approximately 22% and 24% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and '21. Inventory turnover rate decreased to 154 days for the period ended January 31, '22 and that was down nicely from 164 days for the period ended January 31, '21. I'd like to talk about the outlook as we see it. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '22, we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery despite the potential for additional pandemic variants. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout, including boosters, will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. However, it remains very difficult to predict the pandemics path and effect, including factors like new variants, vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruption and inflation which can impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing conservative policies, very strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity enable us to continually invest in new research and development, take advantage of periodic strategic inventory purchasing opportunities and execute on our successful acquisition program, all which collectively position HEICO for market share gains. In closing, I would like again to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. The remainder of fiscal '22 looks very promising. And I do believe that our culture of ownership and entrepreneurial excellence will provide the necessary foundation to win in the marketplace. We thank all of our team members for everything you do to make HEICO a great company. We also thank our shareholders who have been extremely supportive during these difficult times and we appreciate your interest and concern with HEICO. And now I would like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. \nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning, everybody. Larry, thank you for all the color. I have a couple of questions here for Victor and for Eric. Victor, I guess I'd start with the R&D and you talked about the margin pressure there. Is that elevated R&D across all of your product lines? Or is there a specific target market? And so where are you concentrating that spend? And is there a seasonality here? Because I see a similar margin decline last year in the first quarter. So would you expect margins to rise from here?\nVictor Mendelson: Rob, thank you. Good questions. The answer is that, of course, it's not every business, everywhere but I would say it's fairly broad across our product lines where we're spending but it varies, of course, by business. There can be a seasonality to it. I don't know, honestly, this year, whether there is one, but it can be -- there are times of the year in some of our businesses where they have to do more spending and then it tends to plan. Now most of our R&D expense is people and that's followed by third-party vendor expenses, things like testing and parts where we have to buy parts and discard them and we do destructive testing and things like that. So I'd have to actually go in and look at case by case. In terms of our margins, I would say that -- as you've heard me say in the past that -- by the way, these margins, if you add amortization of about 400 basis points to 500 basis points to it, you get to about 30% on an operating basis. I consider an operating basis, obviously a cash flow basis. So those are pretty high margins. And as I've said in the past, I think that we're with -- we're going to stay in shooting distance of that. Whether it's down below that a little or up above that, it's going to vary, I think, by quarter.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, all right. That's very helpful. And then, Eric, I've got one for you. Just really on the supply chain. And are you seeing concerns from the airlines about the ability to procure enough spare parts from the OE component manufacturers that's maybe driving an accelerated interest in your products?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Rob. That's a very good question. We made the conscious decision to, if you recall, when we had -- when the pandemic started, to retain a higher percentage of our people and to make sure that we invested in inventory in order to be able to support the market when it recovered. So the short answer is, yes. I think that we are picking up some market share due to competitors not being able to supply. But I think the majority of the market share, though that we're picking up, is because customers are approving parts that they hadn't purchased before from us. And I met -- in meeting with our sales heads last week in reviewing going customer-by-customer and understanding what the situation is and what the customers are looking for, I can tell you that our people are more optimistic than I have ever seen them in terms of HEICO's market share capture and what the future looks like for us. So yes, some of the short-term lack of supply has helped, but I think it's more of really the long-term development positioning of the product line which has helped us so much.\nRobert Spingarn: So it's really driven by the value opportunity that the customers are looking for?\nEric Mendelson: Correct.\nLaurans Mendelson: Correct.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just on -- and that's really about existing parts in your catalog. Is there any evidence that this is also accelerating the pace of new part development more. Airlines and customers coming to you and saying, can we develop these other parts that you don't currently have for the same reasons?\nEric Mendelson: The answer is, yes. I would say that the airlines have been fairly lean in terms of staff going through the crisis. And obviously, they've had to focus on many things. So I think that the opportunities that we're seeing are more driven by us in the recent past as opposed to driven by the customers but the customer support is just as strong, if not stronger, than it was in the past. And again, it's due to the competitive nature of our products and the desire for the airlines to have alternative sources at competitive prices.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Just the last question on this; would you say your new parts development activity this year is any different than prior years? Are you doing more or less, regardless of the reason?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would say it's consistent with prior years. We did not -- as you probably remember, we did not take down new product development during the crisis. We continue to develop similar number of products. So those products are getting sold. And our current inductions and our forecasted inductions, I would say, are consistent with those numbers. We do have the ability to flex it up if we want and we'll have to see how market developments are.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nEric Mendelson:\n.:\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning, Larry, Victor and Carlos.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Hey, Eric, maybe just to come back to you, maybe just talking about the margins a little bit. You obviously have recovered all the way back which is really great to see. And are you seeing any kind of structural gains coming out of the pandemic? I know you were focused on a lot of cost and -- but you're always kind of careful on pricing, too. So, maybe you could talk a little bit about margins?\nEric Mendelson: So you're talking structural gains in margins specifically as opposed to end customers?\nPeter Arment: Yes.\nEric Mendelson: So, the 19.2% honestly, surprised me on the upside. We thought that we would get back to our historical level, but I thought that it was going to take a longer period of time in there. And I think that speaks to frankly, the strength of our people and the strengths of the product offering. So we'll have to see what develops going forward. But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get back to our old margins fairly soon and possibly exceed them. I want to be careful and not get in front of myself and predict an increase in them. But I can tell you, based on the confidence that I see coming out of the sales and marketing group as well as the businesses, I think that, that's a real possibility.\nPeter Arment: That's really helpful. And then just on Eric, just staying on the kind of the demand environment. How did you see the cadence of orders during the quarter because you obviously had to deal with Omicron. And are you seeing any changes now as we kind of prepare for it or could be a busy, spring and summer season?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. As I've mentioned in the fourth quarter call in December, we thought Omicron would be negative. And of course, in general, it was negative for the industry. However, there has been very strong strength. I would say, the quarter was fairly consistent across it. And I can tell you that the forecast going forward is consistent as well and very strong. So again, I think that's a combination of our market share gains as well as the market just being strong.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate it for all the color. Thanks guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: Hey good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on Peter's question with regard to FSG margin rate. I think we're really talking about a lot of volume -- positive volume impact. I'm interested in just the net inflationary impact to the business. Are you guys seeing gains net of inflation or is inflation kind of holding you back, I guess, that kind of gets to pricing? Could you talk about all that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, absolutely. This is Eric. With regard to gains, I feel very confident of our ability to maintain gains net of inflation. And we've been very cognizant to make sure that we pass those added costs on to our customers. We're not trying to take advantage of them to change the value proposition but we do need to make sure that we get our costs covered. So I can tell you that our businesses, yes, they have seen cost increase in all the usual areas and they've been extremely proactive in making sure that we get those price increases as well to maintain our margins and not give up ground because of inflation.\nPeter Skibitski: All right, appreciate that. Just one last one for me. Maybe you guys are anticipating this a week or two weeks ago but certainly with the news this morning of this Russian Invasion, do you guys foresee any near-term impact to your business? Do you change how you manage the business? And do you get concerned about supplies, like titanium, that sort of a thing? Just interested in your kind of top-level thoughts.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. If you look at our businesses, I think one of the key strengths of HEICO is the decentralized nature. And we've got these basically 60 decentralized business units who are each very intimate and knowledgeable about the products that they use and they work very quickly with their suppliers to get what they need. And that's not to say that we don't have occasional shortages as we do. However, I would not say that there is anything -- there is no one input that is so predominant that would have a major impact across all of HEICO. So specifically, if you look at titanium coming out of Russia, yes, we are a user of titanium. But I think that we've got the ability to buy titanium in the quantities that we use it from a variety of sources. So we're typically able to mitigate that. And typically, it's not going to be a major impact to us like it would -- other folks who require very, very large quantities of this. So we're still very bullish on our business, both on the commercial side as well as the military. Frankly, events of today prove the importance of having a strong defense, not only in the United States and in NATO but around the world. And when the world goes through periods of time without conflict, I think events like today serve as very good reminders that there'll always be somebody out there who wants to destabilize. And the best way to ensure peace is through a strong defense. And that's why we are -- we continue to be very bullish on defense as well as the commercial side and we really like the nature of our businesses.\nPeter Skibitski: Great. Thanks, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nLee Jagoda: Hi, it's actually Lee Jagoda for Larry this morning. Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLee Jagoda: So just going back to the inflation and pricing conversation. Given that both you and obviously, the OEM parts producers are seeing inflation and are trying to price to at least capture the inflationary increases. Does that -- how does that impact the spread between the OEM parts and the PMA parts? And does that make you more competitive in periods of rising material costs?\nEric Mendelson: I would say that it does make us more competitive. There -- the OEM responses tend to be very aggressive and they tend to be in excess of their true cost changes. So we've got the ability to create additional value to make sure that we cover our costs and make sure our margins don't shrink as a result of it. And I think it does make our product offering even more compelling.\nLee Jagoda: Okay. And then just looking at the FSG revenue in Q1, it looks like we're about 5% below where we were in Q1 of 2019. Obviously, not all organic because we have some M&A in there but that was also despite the Omicron impact during Q1. So if we look forward and assume that the Omicron impact is less in the next few quarters than it was in Q1, is it a reasonable assumption to think that FSG revenue looks closer to where it was in 2019 for the full year, just given the Q1 performance. And if for some reason, that's not the case, what are the other factors we should be thinking about to make that not the case?\nCarlos Macau: So this is Carlos. I think if you strip out the acquisitions that we've had since then, it's going to be a slow grind the rest of the year up to those levels. Whether -- I hope we get there in total. But our expectation is that by the end of this fiscal year for HEICO, we ought to be at a run rate that mirrors 2019, end of this year, maybe first quarter of '22. That's been our goal since day 1 of this crisis and what we thought would happen. And I think that's playing out. So we're not giving guidance for the full year but if that directionally gets you where your question is going, I hope it's helpful.\nLee Jagoda: It is helpful. And was your commentary on FSG specifically or both segments?\nCarlos Macau: FSG specifically.\nLee Jagoda: Okay, great. Very helpful.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital.\nKenneth Herbert: Hey, hi. Thanks. Carlos, maybe I could just follow up on that or Eric. It looks like organically, the last three quarters, FSG revenues have grown about, call it, 5%-ish mid-single-digits sequentially. Is there any reason that sort of sequential growth in the segment shouldn't change as we think about the next three quarters here or for the year?\nEric Mendelson: Hi Ken, it's Eric. I think that we're going to continue, as I mentioned, continue to grab market share. And our sequential growth will continue. If you look, our first quarter was frankly well ahead of what anybody expected. And I can tell you, in particular, over on the aftermarket side, the quarter-over-quarter change was really quite strong. So I think, yes, as the year continues, we will -- we'll continue to post the increase. I don't know if Carlos has got added color on.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I think, Kevin, that's probably the right way to look at it because what that does is, it grinds us north as opposed to assuming that we'll have peaks and valleys throughout the year. We continue to believe that it's just going to be more of a linear run back to the '19 levels. And whether it's 5%, 4%, 10%, whatever it is, it's going to get us back at a rate that is more linear than jumping, at least in the FSG. And to Eric's point, one thing that's hard to predict is the strength that we're going to have in any one particular market segment. I think Eric is pointing out that our aftermarket was incredibly strong in Q1 which typically for HEICO Q1 is probably our down quarter, right? It's been historically our softest quarter due to November and December holiday season travels, less days in the quarter, those kind of things and less planes being worked on. They're all in the air flying. So we were very pleased with the FSG's performance in Q1. It did exceed what we thought the company would do in Q1 this year.\nKenneth Herbert: No, that's great. And if I run that out, it looks like you're obviously -- you've got another, call it, sort of quarter of easy comps this quarter, just considering the timing. And then the second half of fiscal '22, obviously, you're up against more challenging comps within FSG. But if I run that out, it looks like you should still be able to maintain pretty significant sort of growth relative to sort of historical averages and where traffic growth could be. And I'm guessing part of that is, it sounds like we're maybe hearing some restocking efforts at some airlines and obviously, we had a pent-up demand. But is there anything else you would call out, Eric, that could perhaps get to or maintain sort of above trend line growth in the back half of the year with what you're seeing in the marketplace today?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I -- going out on a limb here a little bit. And of course, we don't have the orders at the moment to support them because we get most of our orders in the month of shipment. But I think we're going to be comfortably ahead in the back half of the year as well. Given everything that we know today with regard to Omicron, Ukraine, I feel very confident in predicting continued growth. I had the luxury of being able to look at certain detailed numbers. And I can tell you the -- when you look at our commercial aftermarket, the quarter-over-quarter change has really been very, very good. And if you look at the growth that we've had over the prior year, that's also extremely strong. So I feel our growth is going to continue. It's not going to be -- based on what we see here today, it's not going to be limited in our first and second quarter. We're going to grow substantially in the third and fourth quarter as well.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. No, that's excellent. And if I could, just one for Victor. You called out, Victor, in the quarter, some supply chain and Omicron related disruptions. Is it possible to size that a little bit or maybe think about within the defense portfolio, specifically within ETG, how that could have looked organically, excluding some of these onetime disruptions?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. It's a good question. The answer is -- and by the way, the disruptions that I was talking about is mostly actually people related, I think as I commented. I think at one point during January, I made -- a rough estimate is that we had close to 10%, maybe 8%. I'm not sure exactly the number of our people in ETG out because of COVID, either they had it or exposed to somebody who had it or they were caring for somebody. But there was a point in January, when the country and the world was experiencing that surge. So I went into January believing our sales would be at least $10 million higher than where they wound up. And that's -- so the people issue existed within our company. We also had it, as I said, it's some suppliers and even customers and we had customers pushing out deliveries, delaying deliveries, you've got to cooperate with your customers. I mean you could go. And in some instances, I think we had the ability to really push the customer based on a purchase order, a contract but we don't believe in doing that. So these things should resolve themselves over the course of the year. And that I felt really good in December, sales would be at least $10 million higher in the quarter but they move out. And that's why we point out. ETG, it's a great business. They're great margins over time but it tends to be lumpy like that. And something else I should comment on. I think I've been saying it for over a year now, maybe 1.5 years that we thought defense budgets would moderate, drop or flatten out at the very least. And so this isn't inconsistent with our own internal thoughts and planning. Now what's transpired recently on Ukraine and elsewhere, may change that calculus who knows and we'll see. But this is not outside of our contemplation, certainly.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Thank you very much, Victor.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe, Eric, just can you give a little bit more color on maybe what you're seeing from your customers regarding wide-body ordering and parts procurement? It seems like the airline industry in general is getting ready for a pretty big uptick in international travel. Are you seeing that demand flow through yet?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we are. We are starting to see widebody recovery. If you look at the statistics, obviously, domestic is stronger and followed by Europe. Of course, Asia and South America are still depressed. And -- but we do see continued recovery in those markets and -- including the wide-body. So yes, I think people are getting ready for a good wide-body increase in demand here.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Back to Ken's line of questioning. I mean as these carriers prep for the summer season, does that create a step function increase at all in your 2Q FSG revenues and maybe bleed into early 3Q? Or you think you've kind of got all that contemplated?\nEric Mendelson: I think we -- our forecast takes that into account. And that's one of the reasons why I continue to be very bullish in particular in our aftermarket area but also in our new OE equipment areas as well, seeing continued growth throughout the fiscal '22 and '23 due to market share gains as well as recovery.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. And then back to the FSG margins. I mean you're still basically running, I guess, revenue maybe give or take $50 million below your quarterly run rate high. You've been getting really good incrementals. You talked about the efficiencies. I mean, you're in shooting distance already with the margins. Assuming you've got some sustained efficiencies, better cost takeout. I mean could we see these FSG margins get into that 22% to 23% range once we're kind of fully recovered and you guys are kind of humming at a quarterly run rate in excess of 300, call it, $20 million in revenue?\nCarlos Macau: Mike, this is Carlos. Look, we do expect at some point in the future here in the near future that we will get back to approximately 20% operating margins on a sustained basis. During COVID, just be thankful, we didn't structurally change the business. We didn't tool plants or do things that would impact the way we operate. In fact, we kept that structure in place. And so I would be cautious to model in or think about expanded margins at higher interest. Now, I do think what you'll see in the FSG is once we level out and get back to '19 run rate growth from there, you ought to witness what happened historically. If you look back over 15 years, you will see FSG's margins just had these incremental pickups. And really, that was a function of growth in the business and really efficiencies on our fixed costs and SG&A spend and I think that would continue. But I wouldn't anticipate that for the near term. I think that's more of an intermediate play in thinking.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. And then just last one, Eric, any thoughts and maybe even using history as a guideline here on airline consolidation. We've got Frontier and Spirit. What should we expect? I mean if we see more consolidation globally, what typically happens to the HEICO catalog? Is that consolidation generally good for you, bad for you based on historical trends?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Consolidation is typically very good for us. Because basically, the more aircraft that a customer has got, the more savings potential they've got. So it tends to be very good for us. There are -- you point out Frontier and Spirit, there are also some other talk in Europe about some other consolidation. So I think, again, whenever that occurs, it's typically or always good news for us.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it, perfect thanks guys.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: When you start looking at the pipeline for potential acquisition targets, are you seeing more opportunities these days? I guess when we look at COVID, we've seen fewer bankruptcies in the supply chain and as it seems the payment -- the paycheck protection program seem to have worked. But as this kind of expires or already expired and then the banks are now starting to collect on bad debt, does this open up opportunity there for targets?\nLaurans Mendelson: I think -- Kristine, I think we have a pretty full pipeline. We're doing a lot of due diligence. I can tell you the big issue that we face is competition from say, private equity or corporate buyers who will pay 17x EBITDA. And we can't compete. Our model doesn't work at 17x EBITDA. And we were with an investment banker who you probably know fairly well or you would know. And he came for a meeting to talk about an acquisition. And in the conversation, he said, you realize that 90% of all acquisitions are not successful. And the percent -- it's easy to make acquisitions, it's easy to buy but it's not so easy to make them work out. And our model requires us to buy a company, continue it and keep it in the portfolio virtually forever. We don't -- the old expression, we don't buy a company, put lipstick on the pig and dump it, in three years so we make a profit because we increased the multiple or cut expenses by a few bucks. That's not our model. So we're competing with people who have a different model than we do. Now saying all that, we are still able to find companies who are very anxious to join HEICO because of the HEICO culture. But when you're dealing with, say, another private equity company or a corporate, they really don't care about the culture. They just want to get the highest dollar. And if they want the highest dollar, we tell them at the get-go, we're not your buyer. So I would say this is the most difficult part that we're facing. However, there are many people, as I say, because look, we've made 89 acquisitions and we give lists of people that sold companies to us. We give you a list to see if we've done what we said, how we've treated people, how we treated their team members and everything else and that's very positive. So many private owners would rather sell to us at a slightly lower price than to sell to, say, one of the other companies, private equity guys because they know that the culture -- they will stay with the company. They will be able to share in the future profits. We let them keep whatever, 20%, 25%, whatever it might be. So they are really our partners and they like that structure. So there are plenty of companies. We are doing the due diligence. And I can tell you the due diligence that we do, we do it all internally. We don't farm it out to other company, except if there's a specific technical question that we need special expertise. So it takes our staff's time to get in and do it. But we're spending an enormous amount of time on these acquisitions and there are plenty of them in the pipeline.\nKristine Liwag: Okay, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. \nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital Management.\nColin Ducharme: Hi, good morning. Just a couple for you. Look, you've got a heck of a franchise that's in no small part built, been built on long-term industry relationships. And you've historically not used price as a weapon or really a key piece of your growth algorithm. Now that's -- given prior comments in today's call, that's been critical of the HEICO value prop long term for customers but inflation is forcing your hand a little bit here on pricing to protect your margins from inputs. So to kind of protect that historical value prop kind of reputation with customers which has been a differentiator for you. Do you now see an opportunity to embed any pricing models that perhaps share value with customers? And in particular, I'm thinking kind of like discrete COVID supply chain charges or something like that? Akin to what we've seen from freight providers years ago embedding fuel surcharges when those inputs shot up or what we see from certain waste haulers today who have volatile recycling businesses and have kind of price share, cost share mechanisms with customers? Anything that could be perhaps kind of discretely broken out for customers; so they see that it's input-driven for you all, not a HEICO weapon and that, that pricing can kind of rise and fall with that volatility of the share the value with customers. Idea here is further embedding your long-term relationships and gendering new ones and just making that customer base even stickier. Just wondering what you're doing from a pricing standpoint that's been quite different from your long-term history. And I got a follow-up.\nVictor Mendelson: Colin, thank you. That's a very good question. This is Victor. I think you've hit the nail on the head by the way. And it's -- you know that HEICO offers this value proposition across all of our product lines and all of our businesses. So PMA is what's most notable with that, right, is a cost-saving solution but it's actually across the board that what we do is a lower cost alternative to something else. And consistent with that, we've made and our businesses have made the decisions not to go, if you will, ripping off our customers. And not to just use this as an excuse to dig prices and then get them angry with us. And then we lose that long-term loyalty which we have and it's very important and extremely valuable to us. At the same time, of course, we need to be compensated for the additional inflation. We need to maintain our margins, et cetera. So we do it in each business, does it case by case. They decide how they're going to address it. Many businesses use the methods that you've mentioned that where they're putting through something that is identified relative to inflation. The thing is, to be honest, we don't expect inflation to drop back. There may be lower cost here and there. But overall, we would expect that and our businesses expect that their cost rates will be higher. And so the pricing that they've made will continue to stick. And case by case, they'll break it out. They'll show different categories, different reasons. Some customers, you've actually got to do that in the defense realm, where you've got to actually break it out and in other cases.\nCarlos Macau: Colin, I would just add one thing to that. Keep in mind that any price increases that we may be passing on to cover our costs tend to lag, right? You don't often reprice backlog and things like that. So oftentimes, when we're talking about getting a bit of price to cover the cost increases, it's a little more prospective than it is contemporary enough to this quarter. So just keep that in mind.\nColin Ducharme: Okay, thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up. You talked a little bit about supply chain management bottleneck alleviation. Larry chatted about buying inventory ahead being a safe decision for you this quarter. What else? What other color can you provide about additional actions. I've just long heard Eric, Victor talk about cost quality and turn time being keys for HEICO and the value prop. And we know crises are terrible things to waste and often can spark innovation here. So are there any new operating practices that are finding their way into kind of your go-forward HEICO standard operating procedure that are perhaps learned COVID behaviors but might stick longer term to either benefit operating practice, financial model, margins, et cetera?\nVictor Mendelson: Another good question, Colin. And it varies, of course, case by case but the answer is -- to your question is yes, definitely. And it varies by subsidiary, as I said but we look at things that we're doing more things we're doing and more aggressively in automation, in a number of our subsidiaries making decisions to in-source some of the production of materials. Even down in some cases, packaging materials and things like that. Now we want to keep up the right balance. We don't want to create too much of a heavy overhead, if you will. So we leave it up to each subsidiary. But those are some examples between automation and insourcing as well as training and we rely to a certain degree on technology to advance the equipment that we have so that we can increase the throughput. And then there are other things, I mean, increasing the vendor base. We've done that in a number of subsidiaries where we decided to decrease the risk. And that has been, I know of, at least a few that's been a crucial part of decision-making for us. Things like arranging transportation directly in some instances as opposed to going through brokers or through other transportation companies are just some more examples of that. Eric, I don't know if you've got any...\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I agree with all the points that Victor mentioned. And again, I would just point back to our corporate structure which I think is a competitive advantage, that rather than having a highly centralized organization where people are waiting on instructions from the corporate office on what to do. We've got 60 decentralized entrepreneurial, hardworking, aggressive business heads and their staff out in the field, figuring out every day what they need to do. And the old adage, \"necessity is the motherhood of invention,\" I think is very much the case. I mean when there are shortages, people figure out other ways to get stuff done. So, I think that our corporate structure really lends itself very much to these kinds of dislocations. And if you look, we've emerged after every -- after every economic setback, we've emerged a much stronger company in terms of revenues, earnings, margin, cash flow, everything. And I fully anticipate that to happen again after this most recent situation. Operator, I think...\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hi, good morning, guys. How are you doing?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: Just wanted -- a lot of questions were already answered. So the one I wanted to make sure I had a better sense for was at ETG in the first quarter, you mentioned some of the outages related to staffing and COVID and the like. Do you have a sense for how much -- what the opportunity cost of sales were in the quarter related to -- if you have the personnel and everything you needed, sales would have been higher by how much?\nVictor Mendelson: It's -- yes, Gautam, it's a good question. And it's difficult to pinpoint. But -- and that's why I said I believe that we were looking at -- before the surge, we were looking at around $10 million more in revenue in the quarter which moved off into later in the year. And that was principally driven by personnel issues within our company but also actually at vendors and at customers. So it was kind of roundly out there. But that's my best guess at this point is probably in the range of $10 million or so.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And you mentioned the conflict in Ukraine is potentially a stimulant for demand. I was curious maybe what products within ETG could actually see more OPTEMPO driven demand? And what percentage -- if there's a way to frame it quantitatively, like how much of the ETG product portfolio is kind of very OPTEMPO sensitive?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. And I'll give you my opinion on this, of course, I don't know anything more than anybody else about what's happening over in Europe, in Russia, Ukraine, et cetera. But our -- so our products that might see an impact is pretty well across the board. And I don't think it's instantaneous but I don't think tomorrow morning, we're going to suddenly get an order and be able to ship, double the product or something like that because of this. So we'll see what happens. I don't -- none of us know what's going to happen. But it's very much across the board. I mean, we have things that are used, for example, electrooptical products, both in the infrared and the laser realm. We've got a lot of power products, power amplifiers, products like digitizers, tuners, things that help to pick up over the ear signals as well as items that are used on precision guide ammunitions as well as missiles and targeting systems, surveillance and reconnaissance as well. So it's kind of a broad range of what we do. I even see possibility in fuel systems on top of that. But it's hard to know exactly because it really depends on what's being supplied and to whom and what's needed. Is it to our country? Is it to our allies? And how does it make it's way over there? And how does Congressional approval work and state department -- you can get through all those things. So right now, our internal planning and our internal assumption is nothing additional from those. And the rest, if it comes, then we will obviously see that in our sales.\nGautam Khanna: That makes sense. One for Eric, just quickly on FSG. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the submarkets though repair -- component repair versus the PMA parts? If there's any -- are the trends kind of the same? Are they -- are you seeing any disconnects there? And so what might explain it?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Our -- I would have to say that our aftermarket across -- our commercial aftermarket across PMA, repair and distribution is all up similarly and operating in similar area. Yes, there's been particular strength over in the PMA area. But our aftermarket is really performing extremely well. There are times when one business may be ahead of the other. But I would say they're all in a very similar number. And frankly, have surprised me in terms of the recovery which has been very swift and meaningful.\nCarlos Macau: I'll just further point out your knowledge that we talked in December on our call about Specialty Products being a laggard in '21 with the OEM products that they produce. And we started to see life out of that slip of the business during Q1. So that was very positive. And we think that will be a tailwind for us going into '22.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nRon Epstein: Good morning, guys.\nCarlos Macau: Good morning.\nRon Epstein: Yes. One area I don't think you spoke to but I was wondering how it's going. How are things on the labor front, right? I mean, labor is pretty tight. Have you been able to keep all of your employees and so on and so forth? And what are you seeing in terms of labor inflation?\nVictor Mendelson: Well...\nEric Mendelson: Go ahead.\nVictor Mendelson: We've been very good at retention. Definitely, there is inflation in payroll and people are the most important part of our business. So we are making sure that we take care of our people and that is definitely an inflation factor. Again, generally winds up something that we can pass on to our customers, they understand and expect it because they're undergoing the same thing. It is challenging to get new people, right, for growth and retirements and things of that sort. And that's where I said that it's the kind of thing that we just have to address on a case-by-case basis.\nEric Mendelson: And Ron, I would -- this is Eric. I would also add that due to our corporate structure and due to the competitive advantage we've got by operating these smaller businesses, I would have to say that overall, our people, our legacy people, the people who have been at the company a number of years like very much the way that they are treated because they are able to do meaningful work, they're able to decide autonomously what they want to do. They're intrinsically motivated. And also, they feel good when the opportunity, there are -- if you look at large corporate employers, typically, people aren't able to decide and people are not able to make their own decisions on running their businesses, running their areas, they've got to go through five levels of sign off. They've got to get other people involved. At HEICO very entrepreneurial and decentralized and that's very, very rewarding for people, number one. Number two, when you compare HEICO to a private equity shop, where everybody understands very clearly in private equity, that the goal is to get a temporary rise, defer shipments, accelerate shipments, get it all into one period, try to price off an abnormally high moment in time, try to get the highest multiple as possible. They understand that their labor is not really appreciated. And yes, there could be a financial -- a short-term financial benefit but it's not a long-term benefit. And if you look at the performance of these companies, they're really substandard. So Victor mentioned that we tend to hang on to our people and do very well with that. Yes, it is harder to get new people. However, we've also been successful in being able to recruit new folks. As far as labor rate inflation, I would say that it's consistent with what you read in the newspaper about what's going on nationally. Yes, it depends very much in certain pockets. There are certain areas where they put in -- they've raised minimum wage rates which have a knock-on effect, not a lot of our people are at minimum wage but there are others that are based off of that. So you've got certain labor markets which can be tighter than others. But across the board, I would say it's consistent with what you read nationally.\nCarlos Macau: Ron, this is Carlos. I just want to put since you're a numbers guy like me, I'll put a finer point on it, the attrition rate at HEICO last I checked was in the mid-single digits. And we're proud of that. We -- to Eric's point, Victor's, we tend to keep our folks very happy, give them a good career path. So we're not losing people to others but the cost of labor add-ons to growth aspect of that is inflated from what we've seen in the past.\nRon Epstein: Great. And then, maybe if I can just change gears a little bit. Are you guys seeing any opportunities yet in kind of \"new space\" or in sort of the new aerospace, electric propulsion, the EV side of the world or either in launch or satellites in the commercial space?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. Ron, this is Victor. We are seeing opportunities in all those categories, right? I mean -- and we supply components to a lot of manufacturers or a lot of companies in design stage and things of that sort. In new space and we'll call it, clean aviation, just broadly. And I don't think that's going to be immediately a huge part of our business but we do have to be involved in play. In space, generally speaking, we're serving higher-end applications. And we've always been fairly focused on the value we add that gets recognized in our margins. And that's -- I think that will continue to be the case. We're not going to chase after the more commodity work, the more low-margin work. So we'll try to stay in the upper end. And we're even looking at a few acquisitions which would help us that way.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Ellen Page with Jefferies.\nEllen Page: Hi, thanks for the question. Just looking at ETG; how do we think about the return to growth? And can you give us any sense of how sales trended through the quarter across the different pieces of defense? And anything you can give on the customer split across the Army, Navy and Air Force?\nEric Mendelson: Ellen, we don't break out the sales split or the split by products. But what I can say about it or try to put a little bit of color on it is that, generally speaking, our higher end electronics are stronger than some of the electronics that were -- and are -- or the equipment that were in our forward deployed in what I'll call the operations tempo. And so that's within defense, that's kind of how it broke out. And of course, we're seeing the strength in our non-defense, non-space, the high-end electronics market outside of space, defense and that includes commercial aviation is -- has some nice growth prospects for us there.\nEllen Page: Thank you. That's helpful.\nEric Mendelson: You're welcome.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Louis Raffetto with UBS.\nLouis Raffetto: I guess, Victor, one for you, just to sort of follow up on some of the earlier questions. The -- if we look at ETG year-over-year, margins were down 2% and sales were roughly flat. And obviously, you guys called out defense being weak. So can you ballpark how much of that margin decline was actually just mix? Because I know the defense and space tend to have higher versus any incremental investment or some of those inefficiencies you talked about?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Unfortunately, Louis, I can't break that out.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Figured I tried. And I know that those businesses tend to have...\nVictor Mendelson: Yes.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And then Eric, just one for you. As I look at this new Pioneer business, once it closes, it looks like another one of your typical solid singles or doubles you guys talked about. But I guess I think, a little bit bigger, is that something you guys are looking to may be, be able to leverage some of your other HEICO parts to sell more through that distribution business?\nEric Mendelson: Louis, I would say that's always a possibility. We -- I think you're pretty familiar with how HEICO operates with our decentralized structure. And definitely Pioneer is going to bring into the HEICO family, certain capabilities that aren't as developed or built out today. So I think that our businesses will definitely look to their Pioneer brethren about how to penetrate some additional markets. So yes, I think that, that will definitely be an opportunity for us. Pioneer is really very, very well skilled, very entrepreneurial, fits culturally very well with how HEICO does, performs well financially. So we're very excited about it.\nLouis Raffetto: And then just last one. How much of FSG is distribution, would you say at this point, given Blue, Seal Dynamics, ACT or all those different ones you've got there?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We -- Louis, we -- in our SEC filings, we disaggregate revenue into parts, repair and specialty products. So the distribution business would be within the Parts segment of -- would be reported within the segments but we don't further great disaggregate parts, we just believe it all. It's got very similar dynamics. And you have to remember, in particular over on the commercial side, we can either sell something as a PMA, we can work with the distributor, it really becomes very discretionary which bucket it goes. So we think that it's most wise and provides the greatest investor disclosure and analysis by putting it all together in the parts side because there are such similarities between the businesses.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Thank you very much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further audio questions. Are there any closing remarks?\nLaurans Mendelson: The only closing remarks are, we thank everybody that's been on this call for their interest in HEICO and for their questions. And we look forward to having our second quarter call in about three months from now. So we wish you all a very good day. And we look forward to speaking with you. If you have questions in the meantime, about HEICO, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself are available. Give us a call, send us an e-mail and we'll set up an appointment to speak with you. So thank you and that's the end of our comments for this morning.\nOperator: And thank you. And thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "So this is Carlos. I think if you strip out the acquisitions that we've had since then, it's going to be a slow grind the rest of the year up to those levels. Whether -- I hope we get there in total. But our expectation is that by the end of this fiscal year for HEICO, we ought to be at a run rate that mirrors 2019, end of this year, maybe first quarter of '22. That's been our goal since day 1 of this crisis and what we thought would happen. And I think that's playing out. So we're not giving guidance for the full year but if that directionally gets you where your question is going, I hope it's helpful. FSG specifically. Yes. I think, Kevin, that's probably the right way to look at it because what that does is, it grinds us north as opposed to assuming that we'll have peaks and valleys throughout the year. We continue to believe that it's just going to be more of a linear run back to the '19 levels. And whether it's 5%, 4%, 10%, whatever it is, it's going to get us back at a rate that is more linear than jumping, at least in the FSG. And to Eric's point, one thing that's hard to predict is the strength that we're going to have in any one particular market segment. I think Eric is pointing out that our aftermarket was incredibly strong in Q1 which typically for HEICO Q1 is probably our down quarter, right? It's been historically our softest quarter due to November and December holiday season travels, less days in the quarter, those kind of things and less planes being worked on. They're all in the air flying. So we were very pleased with the FSG's performance in Q1. It did exceed what we thought the company would do in Q1 this year. Mike, this is Carlos. Look, we do expect at some point in the future here in the near future that we will get back to approximately 20% operating margins on a sustained basis. During COVID, just be thankful, we didn't structurally change the business. We didn't tool plants or do things that would impact the way we operate. In fact, we kept that structure in place. And so I would be cautious to model in or think about expanded margins at higher interest. Now, I do think what you'll see in the FSG is once we level out and get back to '19 run rate growth from there, you ought to witness what happened historically. If you look back over 15 years, you will see FSG's margins just had these incremental pickups. And really, that was a function of growth in the business and really efficiencies on our fixed costs and SG&A spend and I think that would continue. But I wouldn't anticipate that for the near term. I think that's more of an intermediate play in thinking. Colin, I would just add one thing to that. Keep in mind that any price increases that we may be passing on to cover our costs tend to lag, right? You don't often reprice backlog and things like that. So oftentimes, when we're talking about getting a bit of price to cover the cost increases, it's a little more prospective than it is contemporary enough to this quarter. So just keep that in mind. I'll just further point out your knowledge that we talked in December on our call about Specialty Products being a laggard in '21 with the OEM products that they produce. And we started to see life out of that slip of the business during Q1. So that was very positive. And we think that will be a tailwind for us going into '22. Thank you. Good morning.

And we're proud of that. We -- to Eric's point, Victor's, we tend to keep our folks very happy, give them a good career path. So we're not losing people to others but the cost of labor add-ons to growth aspect of that is inflated from what we've seen in the past."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $222.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 which was comparable to the $223.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The Electronic Technologies Group experienced continued growth in medical and other electronics products net sales as well as from the impact from our fiscal '21 acquisitions, offset by a slight decrease in defense and space product net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22. As historically -- as has historically been the case, Electronic Technologies Group sales tend to be lumpy by quarter and we expect that this year's three remaining quarters sales will each be greater than the first quarter sales which were reduced as a result of many team members being out from work as the Omicron variant surged. We witnessed the same issue at both vendors and customers, particularly in January which delayed production, deliveries and orders at various subsidiaries. We expect these effects to be cured during the remainder of our year. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $60.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The decrease principally reflects a lower gross profit margin, mainly from an increase in new product research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to support ongoing new product and development activities as well as lower level of efficiencies on SG&A expenses during the quarter. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 25% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to 26.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The lower operating income as a percent of net sales principally reflects an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously mentioned reduced efficiencies as well as the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin. I turn the discussion back over to Larry Mendelson. Rob, thank you. Good questions. The answer is that, of course, it's not every business, everywhere but I would say it's fairly broad across our product lines where we're spending but it varies, of course, by business. There can be a seasonality to it. I don't know, honestly, this year, whether there is one, but it can be -- there are times of the year in some of our businesses where they have to do more spending and then it tends to plan. Now most of our R&D expense is people and that's followed by third-party vendor expenses, things like testing and parts where we have to buy parts and discard them and we do destructive testing and things like that. So I'd have to actually go in and look at case by case. In terms of our margins, I would say that -- as you've heard me say in the past that -- by the way, these margins, if you add amortization of about 400 basis points to 500 basis points to it, you get to about 30% on an operating basis. I consider an operating basis, obviously a cash flow basis. So those are pretty high margins. And as I've said in the past, I think that we're with -- we're going to stay in shooting distance of that. Whether it's down below that a little or up above that, it's going to vary, I think, by quarter. Yes. It's a good question. The answer is -- and by the way, the disruptions that I was talking about is mostly actually people related, I think as I commented. I think at one point during January, I made -- a rough estimate is that we had close to 10%, maybe 8%. I'm not sure exactly the number of our people in ETG out because of COVID, either they had it or exposed to somebody who had it or they were caring for somebody. But there was a point in January, when the country and the world was experiencing that surge. So I went into January believing our sales would be at least $10 million higher than where they wound up. And that's -- so the people issue existed within our company. We also had it, as I said, it's some suppliers and even customers and we had customers pushing out deliveries, delaying deliveries, you've got to cooperate with your customers. I mean you could go. And in some instances, I think we had the ability to really push the customer based on a purchase order, a contract but we don't believe in doing that. So these things should resolve themselves over the course of the year. And that I felt really good in December, sales would be at least $10 million higher in the quarter but they move out. And that's why we point out. ETG, it's a great business. They're great margins over time but it tends to be lumpy like that. And something else I should comment on. I think I've been saying it for over a year now, maybe 1.5 years that we thought defense budgets would moderate, drop or flatten out at the very least. And so this isn't inconsistent with our own internal thoughts and planning. Now what's transpired recently on Ukraine and elsewhere, may change that calculus who knows and we'll see. But this is not outside of our contemplation, certainly. Thank you. Colin, thank you. That's a very good question. This is Victor. I think you've hit the nail on the head by the way. And it's -- you know that HEICO offers this value proposition across all of our product lines and all of our businesses. So PMA is what's most notable with that, right, is a cost-saving solution but it's actually across the board that what we do is a lower cost alternative to something else. And consistent with that, we've made and our businesses have made the decisions not to go, if you will, ripping off our customers. And not to just use this as an excuse to dig prices and then get them angry with us. And then we lose that long-term loyalty which we have and it's very important and extremely valuable to us. At the same time, of course, we need to be compensated for the additional inflation. We need to maintain our margins, et cetera. So we do it in each business, does it case by case. They decide how they're going to address it. Many businesses use the methods that you've mentioned that where they're putting through something that is identified relative to inflation. The thing is, to be honest, we don't expect inflation to drop back. There may be lower cost here and there. But overall, we would expect that and our businesses expect that their cost rates will be higher. And so the pricing that they've made will continue to stick. And case by case, they'll break it out. They'll show different categories, different reasons. Some customers, you've actually got to do that in the defense realm, where you've got to actually break it out and in other cases. Another good question, Colin. And it varies, of course, case by case but the answer is -- to your question is yes, definitely. And it varies by subsidiary, as I said but we look at things that we're doing more things we're doing and more aggressively in automation, in a number of our subsidiaries making decisions to in-source some of the production of materials. Even down in some cases, packaging materials and things like that. Now we want to keep up the right balance. We don't want to create too much of a heavy overhead, if you will. So we leave it up to each subsidiary. But those are some examples between automation and insourcing as well as training and we rely to a certain degree on technology to advance the equipment that we have so that we can increase the throughput. And then there are other things, I mean, increasing the vendor base. We've done that in a number of subsidiaries where we decided to decrease the risk. And that has been, I know of, at least a few that's been a crucial part of decision-making for us. Things like arranging transportation directly in some instances as opposed to going through brokers or through other transportation companies are just some more examples of that. Eric, I don't know if you've got any... It's -- yes, Gautam, it's a good question. And it's difficult to pinpoint. But -- and that's why I said I believe that we were looking at -- before the surge, we were looking at around $10 million more in revenue in the quarter which moved off into later in the year. And that was principally driven by personnel issues within our company but also actually at vendors and at customers. So it was kind of roundly out there. But that's my best guess at this point is probably in the range of $10 million or so. Yes. And I'll give you my opinion on this, of course, I don't know anything more than anybody else about what's happening over in Europe, in Russia, Ukraine, et cetera. But our -- so our products that might see an impact is pretty well across the board. And I don't think it's instantaneous but I don't think tomorrow morning, we're going to suddenly get an order and be able to ship, double the product or something like that because of this. So we'll see what happens. I don't -- none of us know what's going to happen. But it's very much across the board. I mean, we have things that are used, for example, electrooptical products, both in the infrared and the laser realm. We've got a lot of power products, power amplifiers, products like digitizers, tuners, things that help to pick up over the ear signals as well as items that are used on precision guide ammunitions as well as missiles and targeting systems, surveillance and reconnaissance as well. So it's kind of a broad range of what we do. I even see possibility in fuel systems on top of that. But it's hard to know exactly because it really depends on what's being supplied and to whom and what's needed. Is it to our country? Is it to our allies? And how does it make it's way over there? And how does Congressional approval work and state department -- you can get through all those things. So right now, our internal planning and our internal assumption is nothing additional from those. And the rest, if it comes, then we will obviously see that in our sales. Well... We've been very good at retention. Definitely, there is inflation in payroll and people are the most important part of our business. So we are making sure that we take care of our people and that is definitely an inflation factor. Again, generally winds up something that we can pass on to our customers, they understand and expect it because they're undergoing the same thing. It is challenging to get new people, right, for growth and retirements and things of that sort. And that's where I said that it's the kind of thing that we just have to address on a case-by-case basis. Sure. Ron, this is Victor. We are seeing opportunities in all those categories, right? I mean -- and we supply components to a lot of manufacturers or a lot of companies in design stage and things of that sort. In new space and we'll call it, clean aviation, just broadly. And I don't think that's going to be immediately a huge part of our business but we do have to be involved in play. In space, generally speaking, we're serving higher-end applications. And we've always been fairly focused on the value we add that gets recognized in our margins. And that's -- I think that will continue to be the case. We're not going to chase after the more commodity work, the more low-margin work. So we'll try to stay in the upper end. And we're even looking at a few acquisitions which would help us that way. Yes. Unfortunately, Louis, I can't break that out. Yes."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Polly, thank you, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us and welcome you to HEICO's first quarter fiscal '22 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into excellent results for shareholders and I'm encouraged by the steady improvement in the operating results over the past 18 months. I'm also optimistic that this trend will continue during the remainder of fiscal year -- this fiscal year. I will now summarize the highlights of the first quarter fiscal '22 results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 improved 23% and 17%, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21, driven mainly by our 13% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the favorable impact from our fiscal '21 acquisitions. The Flight Support Group reported quarterly increases of 103% and 37% in operating income and net sales, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21. These results principally reflect strong 48% quarterly organic growth for commercial aerospace parts and services. Additionally, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at Flight Support. Our total debt to shareholders' equity improved to 10.1% as of January 31, '22. And that was down slightly from 10.3% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt, which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, of $112.3 million at January 31, '22, compared to shareholders' equity ratio improved to 4.8% as of January 31, '22 and that was down slightly from 5.6% as of October 31, '21. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 0.22x as of January 31, '22 and down -- that was down slightly, again from 0.26x as of October 31, '21. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal '24 and we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high-quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, that compared to $107.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The decrease is principally attributable to an investment of $54.8 million in working capital, partially offset by $18 million increase in net income from consolidated operations. The investment in working capital includes $29.6 million increase in inventories which reflect strategic buys within distribution businesses and to support an increase in the consolidated backlog as well as a decrease in accrued expenses resulting from the payment of fiscal '21 accrued performance-based compensation. A little bit of color. We added to inventory, as you know, to prevent inventory shortages. So our companies would not be running out of stock and could complete their manufacturing and processes and ship. We think that, that was a very wise decision. In January '22, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.09 per share. This represented our 87th consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. In January '22, we reported that our Sierra Microwave subsidiary, designed and manufactured flight critical components in the James Webb Space Telescope, which is considered to be the premier observatory of the next decade. As always, we thank Sierra Microwave for their outstanding accomplishments, great quality and we take great pride in their involvement in this amazing feat. Moving over to recent acquisition activity; February 22, we announced Flight Support and entered into an agreement to acquire 74% of the membership interest of Pioneer Industries LLC, a specialty distributor of spares for military aviation, marine and ground platforms. The remaining 26% will continue to be owned by certain members of Pioneer's management team and closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal '22. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing. My own comment, which was not prepared is that, in my own mind, this was a very timely acquisition because of the events taking place in Ukraine and possibly in the future in the Far East. We think our military budget clearly, I've read this morning, that Congress is probably going to pass some additional military budgets and I would not be surprised to see that. My comment is, that's a good idea. We continue to bet excellent M&A opportunities, which meet our high standards for acquisition. Due diligence is ongoing on many of these opportunities and I'm optimistic that we will be successful in closing additional transactions in fiscal '22, all of which I believe will be accretive to earnings. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the results of the Flight Support Group. Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 24% to $0.63 in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up from $0.51 in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned higher consolidated operating income. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $23.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up very slightly from $23 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Research and development; significant ongoing new product development efforts are continuing at both Electronic Technologies and Flight Support and this is critical for the development of new products and technologies that fuel our growth. R&D expense increased to $18.4 million or 3.8% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that was up from $16.2 million or 3.9% of sales -- net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $91.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to $78.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. And that's in line with our large net sales growth and is inclusive of a $3.8 million higher corporate expense, mainly attributable to increased performance-based compensation expense as well as the suspension of corporate salary reductions as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Consolidated SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 18.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that compared to 18.7% in the first quarter of fiscal '21, a slight drop. Interest expense decreased to $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, down from $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and that was due to lower weighted average borrowing balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Other income in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and '22 was not significant. HEICO's effective tax rate was 4.1% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and that compared to 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The rate increase -- slight rate increase reflect an unfavorable impact from tax-exempt unrealized losses in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies relating to the HEICO leadership compensation plan during the first quarter of fiscal '22 as compared to tax-exempt unrealized gains recognized on such policies in the first quarter of fiscal '21, partially offset by a larger tax benefit from stock option exercise recognized in the first quarter of fiscal '22. My comment on this, when we get into the details in the questions, some people have pointed out that the gain from year-to-year was a result of tax and so forth. And if you study -- dig deep into it, you'll see that the two tax provisions are fairly comparable. So we are really comparing apples and apples. So when you say the -- to analyze it, certain people have pointed out that it's all due to tax benefit. And in my opinion, that is definitely not the case and those people should clarify it with Carlos, who can explain it to them in more detail. HEICO recognized a discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises in both the first quarter of fiscal '22 and '21 and they were $17.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively and that resulted from strong appreciation in HEICO stock price during the option lease holding period. For those of you who are not familiar with the taxation of stock options, again, Carlos can get into the detail. But essentially, the recipient of the stock option when he exercises it pays ordinary income tax on the gain, whether he sells the stock or not. And the company takes a tax deduction for the opposite side for the gain. So that's how the company picks up this tax benefit. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $7.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22. That compared to $5.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21, principally reflecting aggregate increase in the operating results of subsidiaries in which noncontrolling interests are held. Bottom line, noncontrolling interest-owned companies did very well. For the first full fiscal year '22, we continue to estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of between 25% and 27% of pretax income. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow; our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain very strong. Working capital ratio improved to 3.6x as of January '22 -- January 31, '22 and that was up from 3.2x as of October 31, '21. Our accounts receivable days outstanding which we call DSOs, improved to 43 days as of January 31, '22 and that was down from 45 days as of January 31, '21. We continue to closely monitor all receivable collection efforts in order to limit our credit exposure. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales and our Top 5 customers represented approximately 22% and 24% of consolidated net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '22 and '21. Inventory turnover rate decreased to 154 days for the period ended January 31, '22 and that was down nicely from 164 days for the period ended January 31, '21. I'd like to talk about the outlook as we see it. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '22, we expect global commercial air travel to continue on a path to recovery despite the potential for additional pandemic variants. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout, including boosters, will continue to positively influence global commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve. However, it remains very difficult to predict the pandemics path and effect, including factors like new variants, vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruption and inflation which can impact our key markets. Therefore, we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal '22 net sales and earnings guidance at this time. However, we believe that our ongoing conservative policies, very strong balance sheet, high degree of liquidity enable us to continually invest in new research and development, take advantage of periodic strategic inventory purchasing opportunities and execute on our successful acquisition program, all which collectively position HEICO for market share gains. In closing, I would like again to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. The remainder of fiscal '22 looks very promising. And I do believe that our culture of ownership and entrepreneurial excellence will provide the necessary foundation to win in the marketplace. We thank all of our team members for everything you do to make HEICO a great company. We also thank our shareholders who have been extremely supportive during these difficult times and we appreciate your interest and concern with HEICO. And now I would like to open the floor for questions. Correct. I think -- Kristine, I think we have a pretty full pipeline. We're doing a lot of due diligence. I can tell you the big issue that we face is competition from say, private equity or corporate buyers who will pay 17x EBITDA. And we can't compete. Our model doesn't work at 17x EBITDA. And we were with an investment banker who you probably know fairly well or you would know. And he came for a meeting to talk about an acquisition. And in the conversation, he said, you realize that 90% of all acquisitions are not successful. And the percent -- it's easy to make acquisitions, it's easy to buy but it's not so easy to make them work out. And our model requires us to buy a company, continue it and keep it in the portfolio virtually forever. We don't -- the old expression, we don't buy a company, put lipstick on the pig and dump it, in three years so we make a profit because we increased the multiple or cut expenses by a few bucks. That's not our model. So we're competing with people who have a different model than we do. Now saying all that, we are still able to find companies who are very anxious to join HEICO because of the HEICO culture. But when you're dealing with, say, another private equity company or a corporate, they really don't care about the culture. They just want to get the highest dollar. And if they want the highest dollar, we tell them at the get-go, we're not your buyer. So I would say this is the most difficult part that we're facing. However, there are many people, as I say, because look, we've made 89 acquisitions and we give lists of people that sold companies to us. We give you a list to see if we've done what we said, how we've treated people, how we treated their team members and everything else and that's very positive. So many private owners would rather sell to us at a slightly lower price than to sell to, say, one of the other companies, private equity guys because they know that the culture -- they will stay with the company. They will be able to share in the future profits. We let them keep whatever, 20%, 25%, whatever it might be. So they are really our partners and they like that structure. So there are plenty of companies. We are doing the due diligence. And I can tell you the due diligence that we do, we do it all internally. We don't farm it out to other company, except if there's a specific technical question that we need special expertise. So it takes our staff's time to get in and do it. But we're spending an enormous amount of time on these acquisitions and there are plenty of them in the pipeline. Thank you. The only closing remarks are, we thank everybody that's been on this call for their interest in HEICO and for their questions. And we look forward to having our second quarter call in about three months from now. So we wish you all a very good day. And we look forward to speaking with you. If you have questions in the meantime, about HEICO, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself are available. Give us a call, send us an e-mail and we'll set up an appointment to speak with you. So thank you and that's the end of our comments for this morning."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 37% to $272.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from $199.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The net sales increase reflects strong organic growth of 30% as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '21 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 103% to $52.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from $25.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The operating income increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned net sales increase which was across all of our product lines. Additionally, the operating income increase reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and the benefit of SG&A efficiencies realized from higher net sales volume. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 19.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '22, up from 13% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin as well as a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales -- as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Good morning, Rob. That's a very good question. We made the conscious decision to, if you recall, when we had -- when the pandemic started, to retain a higher percentage of our people and to make sure that we invested in inventory in order to be able to support the market when it recovered. So the short answer is, yes. I think that we are picking up some market share due to competitors not being able to supply. But I think the majority of the market share, though that we're picking up, is because customers are approving parts that they hadn't purchased before from us. And I met -- in meeting with our sales heads last week in reviewing going customer-by-customer and understanding what the situation is and what the customers are looking for, I can tell you that our people are more optimistic than I have ever seen them in terms of HEICO's market share capture and what the future looks like for us. So yes, some of the short-term lack of supply has helped, but I think it's more of really the long-term development positioning of the product line which has helped us so much. Correct. The answer is, yes. I would say that the airlines have been fairly lean in terms of staff going through the crisis. And obviously, they've had to focus on many things. So I think that the opportunities that we're seeing are more driven by us in the recent past as opposed to driven by the customers but the customer support is just as strong, if not stronger, than it was in the past. And again, it's due to the competitive nature of our products and the desire for the airlines to have alternative sources at competitive prices. Yes. I would say it's consistent with prior years. We did not -- as you probably remember, we did not take down new product development during the crisis. We continue to develop similar number of products. So those products are getting sold. And our current inductions and our forecasted inductions, I would say, are consistent with those numbers. We do have the ability to flex it up if we want and we'll have to see how market developments are. .: Good morning. So you're talking structural gains in margins specifically as opposed to end customers? So, the 19.2% honestly, surprised me on the upside. We thought that we would get back to our historical level, but I thought that it was going to take a longer period of time in there. And I think that speaks to frankly, the strength of our people and the strengths of the product offering. So we'll have to see what develops going forward. But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get back to our old margins fairly soon and possibly exceed them. I want to be careful and not get in front of myself and predict an increase in them. But I can tell you, based on the confidence that I see coming out of the sales and marketing group as well as the businesses, I think that, that's a real possibility. Yes. As I've mentioned in the fourth quarter call in December, we thought Omicron would be negative. And of course, in general, it was negative for the industry. However, there has been very strong strength. I would say, the quarter was fairly consistent across it. And I can tell you that the forecast going forward is consistent as well and very strong. So again, I think that's a combination of our market share gains as well as the market just being strong. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. This is Eric. With regard to gains, I feel very confident of our ability to maintain gains net of inflation. And we've been very cognizant to make sure that we pass those added costs on to our customers. We're not trying to take advantage of them to change the value proposition but we do need to make sure that we get our costs covered. So I can tell you that our businesses, yes, they have seen cost increase in all the usual areas and they've been extremely proactive in making sure that we get those price increases as well to maintain our margins and not give up ground because of inflation. Yes. If you look at our businesses, I think one of the key strengths of HEICO is the decentralized nature. And we've got these basically 60 decentralized business units who are each very intimate and knowledgeable about the products that they use and they work very quickly with their suppliers to get what they need. And that's not to say that we don't have occasional shortages as we do. However, I would not say that there is anything -- there is no one input that is so predominant that would have a major impact across all of HEICO. So specifically, if you look at titanium coming out of Russia, yes, we are a user of titanium. But I think that we've got the ability to buy titanium in the quantities that we use it from a variety of sources. So we're typically able to mitigate that. And typically, it's not going to be a major impact to us like it would -- other folks who require very, very large quantities of this. So we're still very bullish on our business, both on the commercial side as well as the military. Frankly, events of today prove the importance of having a strong defense, not only in the United States and in NATO but around the world. And when the world goes through periods of time without conflict, I think events like today serve as very good reminders that there'll always be somebody out there who wants to destabilize. And the best way to ensure peace is through a strong defense. And that's why we are -- we continue to be very bullish on defense as well as the commercial side and we really like the nature of our businesses. Thank you. Good morning. I would say that it does make us more competitive. There -- the OEM responses tend to be very aggressive and they tend to be in excess of their true cost changes. So we've got the ability to create additional value to make sure that we cover our costs and make sure our margins don't shrink as a result of it. And I think it does make our product offering even more compelling. Hi Ken, it's Eric. I think that we're going to continue, as I mentioned, continue to grab market share. And our sequential growth will continue. If you look, our first quarter was frankly well ahead of what anybody expected. And I can tell you, in particular, over on the aftermarket side, the quarter-over-quarter change was really quite strong. So I think, yes, as the year continues, we will -- we'll continue to post the increase. I don't know if Carlos has got added color on. Yes. I -- going out on a limb here a little bit. And of course, we don't have the orders at the moment to support them because we get most of our orders in the month of shipment. But I think we're going to be comfortably ahead in the back half of the year as well. Given everything that we know today with regard to Omicron, Ukraine, I feel very confident in predicting continued growth. I had the luxury of being able to look at certain detailed numbers. And I can tell you the -- when you look at our commercial aftermarket, the quarter-over-quarter change has really been very, very good. And if you look at the growth that we've had over the prior year, that's also extremely strong. So I feel our growth is going to continue. It's not going to be -- based on what we see here today, it's not going to be limited in our first and second quarter. We're going to grow substantially in the third and fourth quarter as well. Yes, we are. We are starting to see widebody recovery. If you look at the statistics, obviously, domestic is stronger and followed by Europe. Of course, Asia and South America are still depressed. And -- but we do see continued recovery in those markets and -- including the wide-body. So yes, I think people are getting ready for a good wide-body increase in demand here. I think we -- our forecast takes that into account. And that's one of the reasons why I continue to be very bullish in particular in our aftermarket area but also in our new OE equipment areas as well, seeing continued growth throughout the fiscal '22 and '23 due to market share gains as well as recovery. Yes. Consolidation is typically very good for us. Because basically, the more aircraft that a customer has got, the more savings potential they've got. So it tends to be very good for us. There are -- you point out Frontier and Spirit, there are also some other talk in Europe about some other consolidation. So I think, again, whenever that occurs, it's typically or always good news for us. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. I agree with all the points that Victor mentioned. And again, I would just point back to our corporate structure which I think is a competitive advantage, that rather than having a highly centralized organization where people are waiting on instructions from the corporate office on what to do. We've got 60 decentralized entrepreneurial, hardworking, aggressive business heads and their staff out in the field, figuring out every day what they need to do. And the old adage, \"necessity is the motherhood of invention,\" I think is very much the case. I mean when there are shortages, people figure out other ways to get stuff done. So, I think that our corporate structure really lends itself very much to these kinds of dislocations. And if you look, we've emerged after every -- after every economic setback, we've emerged a much stronger company in terms of revenues, earnings, margin, cash flow, everything. And I fully anticipate that to happen again after this most recent situation. Operator, I think... Good morning. Yes. Our -- I would have to say that our aftermarket across -- our commercial aftermarket across PMA, repair and distribution is all up similarly and operating in similar area. Yes, there's been particular strength over in the PMA area. But our aftermarket is really performing extremely well. There are times when one business may be ahead of the other. But I would say they're all in a very similar number. And frankly, have surprised me in terms of the recovery which has been very swift and meaningful. Go ahead. And Ron, I would -- this is Eric. I would also add that due to our corporate structure and due to the competitive advantage we've got by operating these smaller businesses, I would have to say that overall, our people, our legacy people, the people who have been at the company a number of years like very much the way that they are treated because they are able to do meaningful work, they're able to decide autonomously what they want to do. They're intrinsically motivated. And also, they feel good when the opportunity, there are -- if you look at large corporate employers, typically, people aren't able to decide and people are not able to make their own decisions on running their businesses, running their areas, they've got to go through five levels of sign off. They've got to get other people involved. At HEICO very entrepreneurial and decentralized and that's very, very rewarding for people, number one. Number two, when you compare HEICO to a private equity shop, where everybody understands very clearly in private equity, that the goal is to get a temporary rise, defer shipments, accelerate shipments, get it all into one period, try to price off an abnormally high moment in time, try to get the highest multiple as possible. They understand that their labor is not really appreciated. And yes, there could be a financial -- a short-term financial benefit but it's not a long-term benefit. And if you look at the performance of these companies, they're really substandard. So Victor mentioned that we tend to hang on to our people and do very well with that. Yes, it is harder to get new people. However, we've also been successful in being able to recruit new folks. As far as labor rate inflation, I would say that it's consistent with what you read in the newspaper about what's going on nationally. Yes, it depends very much in certain pockets. There are certain areas where they put in -- they've raised minimum wage rates which have a knock-on effect, not a lot of our people are at minimum wage but there are others that are based off of that. So you've got certain labor markets which can be tighter than others. But across the board, I would say it's consistent with what you read nationally. Ellen, we don't break out the sales split or the split by products. But what I can say about it or try to put a little bit of color on it is that, generally speaking, our higher end electronics are stronger than some of the electronics that were -- and are -- or the equipment that were in our forward deployed in what I'll call the operations tempo. And so that's within defense, that's kind of how it broke out. And of course, we're seeing the strength in our non-defense, non-space, the high-end electronics market outside of space, defense and that includes commercial aviation is -- has some nice growth prospects for us there. You're welcome. Louis, I would say that's always a possibility. We -- I think you're pretty familiar with how HEICO operates with our decentralized structure. And definitely Pioneer is going to bring into the HEICO family, certain capabilities that aren't as developed or built out today. So I think that our businesses will definitely look to their Pioneer brethren about how to penetrate some additional markets. So yes, I think that, that will definitely be an opportunity for us. Pioneer is really very, very well skilled, very entrepreneurial, fits culturally very well with how HEICO does, performs well financially. So we're very excited about it. Yes. We -- Louis, we -- in our SEC filings, we disaggregate revenue into parts, repair and specialty products. So the distribution business would be within the Parts segment of -- would be reported within the segments but we don't further great disaggregate parts, we just believe it all. It's got very similar dynamics. And you have to remember, in particular over on the commercial side, we can either sell something as a PMA, we can work with the distributor, it really becomes very discretionary which bucket it goes. So we think that it's most wise and provides the greatest investor disclosure and analysis by putting it all together in the parts side because there are such similarities between the businesses. Thank you."

I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Samara. Good morning to everyone on this call, and we thank you very much for joining us, and we welcome you to the HEICO fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I\u2019m joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO\u2019s Co-President and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO\u2019s talented team members for delivering another strong quarter and strong year. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into superb results for the shareholders. I would also like to congratulate and thank the Wencor team for a terrific quarter within the HEICO family. We could not be more pleased with their performance and their results. I personally continue to be very optimistic about the future for HEICO. And as a matter of fact, I have never been more optimistic about HEICO\u2019s future than I am today. I will now summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 record results. Consolidated fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 operating income and net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group and Electronic Technologies Group, mainly arising from continued strong demand for our commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal \u201823 and \u201822 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 improved by 29% and 54% respectively as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. These results mainly reflect 14% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the impact from the acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 6% to $103.4 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and that was up from $97.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. In connection with the Wencor acquisition, HEICO incurred acquisition cost during the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and they decreased net income attributable to HEICO by approximately $13.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Our consolidated operating margins before the Wencor related non-recurring deal expenses remain strong and are consistent with the expectations we have previously communicated. These margins are extremely healthy, even though our product mix this year has meant lower overall margins than in prior year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, excluding the Wencor acquisition cost, consolidated net income increased 20% to $117 million or $0.84 per diluted share. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.04x as of October 31, \u201823 and that compares to 0.25x as of October 31, \u201822. The net debt to EBITDA ratio increased in the fiscal year ending October 31, \u201823 principally reflects our successful offering of $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes and increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of Wencor. Cash flow provided by operating activities improved to $148.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and that was up from $143.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. Cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support our increased consolidated backlog. The continued excellent cash flow generation by HEICO permitted our Board of Directors to recently declare a $0.10 per share semiannual dividend, which represents our 91st consecutive dividend payment. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. I would like to take a moment to recognize and welcome the Wencor team members to the HEICO family. The Wencor team is a perfect and highly complementary fit with the HEICO culture and I am extremely optimistic about the future of Wencor\u2019s contributions to the Flight Support Group\u2019s future. I must say that over the last number of months, I have gotten the chance to visit most of the Wencor facilities. And I\u2019ve been incredibly impressed with the caliber of team members that Wencor has. We had very high expectations for them prior to closing the acquisition, but they continue to amaze everyone and really perform outstandingly well. It really is a privilege and an honor to have gotten to know these people. And also I\u2019d like to thank the HEICO team members for being so welcoming to their new Wencor brothers and sisters and bringing them into the board, because as a team, we can accomplish so much more than we can individually. The HEICO team members have been phenomenally excited about the Wencor acquisitions. We have done about 100 acquisitions, but I can say that this one really has generated incredible enthusiasm and excitement. And I am just absolutely honored to work with both the HEICO and the Wencor team members. We have got a phenomenal group. And I think the results really speak for themselves with a lot more to come. So, again, thank you very much to all of our HEICO Flight Support team members for an incredible performance in the fourth quarter and full 2023. On to the results. The Flight Support Group\u2019s net sales increased 74% to a record $601.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $346 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 reflects $185.7 million from Wencor and strong organic growth of 20%. The Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income increased 47% to a record $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $77.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. Wencor\u2019s operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $29.3 million. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by $12.7 million of Wencor acquisition costs and $11.8 million of Wencor\u2019s intangible asset amortization expense and higher performance-based compensation expense. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Fight Support Group\u2019s operating margin was 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 as compared to 22.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The operating margin decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 principally reflects the previously mentioned Wencor acquisition cost and intangible asset amortization expense. Excluding the Wencor acquisition cost and intangible asset amortization expense, the Flight Support Group\u2019s operating income increased 79% to $139.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and the operating margin was 23.1%. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO\u2019s Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s net sales increased 28% to a record $342.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $268.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal \u201823 and \u201822 acquisitions as well as 6% organic growth. The organic net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 mainly resulted from increased net sales of defense, space and commercial aviation products, partially offset by lower net sales of other electronics products. We are pleased to see 26% sequential growth in defense product net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 over the prior quarter, which now marks our third consecutive quarter of defense-related net sales growth. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating income increased 8% to a record $86.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by higher costs from the Exxelia acquisition, higher performance-based compensation expense and unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent compensation. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 25.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 as compared to 29.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. As acquisitions intangible amortization is equal to approximately 400 basis points from our sales, we view that our ETG businesses achieved a roughly 29% margin from their, what we consider to be their true operational activities, which is excellent by any measure. And we are very happy with it even if it is not as high as it was before. I also note that in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we recorded a $3 million gain from contingent consideration reversal. So last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating income included that gain, while this year, we had the opposite effect, which reduced the operating margin in total between the 2 years by around 140 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. All of this is why I look at what we consider to be the businesses\u2019 actual performance before non-cash acquisition accounting. And that, as I said before, is excellent in absolute terms. The lower operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, as we said, principally reflects the previously mentioned higher costs from the Exxelia acquisition, the unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of contingent compensation and higher performance-based compensation. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal \u201824, we anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support Group and the Electronic Technologies Group and that will be driven by contributions from our fiscal \u201823 acquisitions as well as the demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures may lead to higher material and labor costs. We plan to actively work on Wencor\u2019s ongoing integration into our business and operations, continue our commitment to developing new products and services and further market penetration while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. Our operating margins, especially before non-recurring acquisition expenses remain extremely healthy and reflect our strong business operations. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies and strong cash flow enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of strategic acquisition opportunities, which collectively position HEICO for success in the markets that we serve. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Their persistent drive and determination to win in the marketplace has resulted in another quarter of outstanding results. Thank you all team members for everything you do to make HEICO a great company. And now, Samantha, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning everybody.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: You put up a terrific quarter. You\u2019re so far ahead of 2019 where everybody else is trying to get even on an organic basis. I\u2019d like to start there with Victor and just talk about this 26% sequential growth, Victor, if you could and characterize what\u2019s behind that? Is that across defense? Is it a few specific programs that have started to move forward?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, hey, Rob, it\u2019s good to talk with you. And it\u2019s a good question as always. So I think our strongest market right now and what\u2019s the biggest driver has been commercial aviation. And we have a few businesses in the ETG that have been particularly strong as a result of multiple factors. Some of it is the recovery in air travel. Some of it is new products that we have introduced. Some of it is also some efficiency initiatives and some of it is acquisition related. So it\u2019s a broad mix there. Defense is definitely moving in the right direction for us as well. The \u2013 and commercial space is holding in pretty nicely overall for us. There are pockets of weakness here and there. But overall, it\u2019s pretty good for us. I would say the headwind for us and I mentioned this before, I think over the last year, I signaled this probably a year or more ago that I thought some of our high-end non-aerospace and defense markets would start to turn down this year. And those have been more difficult. So, those markets that serve some high-end electronics, medical and markets like those are definitely trending in the opposite direction. And I would expect that will continue for some time. And I think we will see the effects of that over the next few quarters, actually, first quarter in particular and as we go on into the year before that starts to reverse. And that\u2019s principally a result of probably overly aggressive ordering by customers during the supply chain crunch dealing with the same kinds of things that we were dealing with. They wanted to get out ahead of it. And now the deliveries are coming in and some of their orders maybe slower, so they have to correct their inventory levels.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Understood. And then the next one moves over to FSG. So Eric, this is either for you, it could be for Carlos. But if we look at the 8-K that you filed back in mid-October, it looks like Wencor sales outgrew overall organic sales for FSG. I mean the numbers look like they could be 40% or more. It\u2019s not an exact comparison, because it\u2019s an October quarter versus the December quarter. But I wanted to ask if that math is correct. And if so, what\u2019s driving that strong performance and can it continue for Wencor?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, good morning, Rob, This is Eric. So I\u2019ll start out answering that question, and then Carlos will fill in with some of the details. Wencor has performed exceptionally well as have, frankly, all of the HEICO Flight Support businesses. They are ahead of plan. They are doing very well, working incredibly hard and very similar in culture to the HEICO Group in terms of being conservative in what they predict and frankly, outperforming. I am not sure that the numbers that you state are let\u2019s see what Carlos has to say about it. My sense is the Wencor is growing at a similar rate to the HEICO Flight Support aftermarket businesses, but I\u2019ll let Carlos fill in on that.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, Rob, this is Carlos. I would say that you have to remember that when we put the 8-K out, we had pro forma sales in there, which, as you know, Wencor has some acquisitions early in \u201823 and so that\u2019s probably why you are seeing sort of exponential growth. I really, to be honest, haven\u2019t gone back and calculated the organic as we just bought them. I will tell you that we were counting on about $724 million in pro forma sales. I mean if you just divide that before, we would expect at $181 million, they delivered almost $186 million. So we are pleased with the sales growth. I would say that Q4 is typically a little bit more richer than some of the other quarters when it comes to aerospace sales. So, none of this is unexpected. But no, they had a great year. And to Eric\u2019s point, they are performing at the same rate that the overall FSG is, particularly in the parts business.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And just on all of this growth and on the complementary nature of the two groups, Eric, how are you doing with the cross-selling effort? Has that started to get traction and what might we expect from that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I would say that we have started the effort and its borne fruit. There are a number of projects that the companies are cooperating on. The HEICO style is very much to let our new acquisitions to continue to run as they have. So we can really make sure that we fully understand. I can tell you that a lot of the businesses are cooperating, figuring out product rationalization, how to maximize sales opportunities. There are number of projects that are moving forward. But I would say that, that\u2019s something that we are going to be getting into more heavily in 2024.\nRobert Spingarn: Great. Thank you so much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nPete Skibitski: Maybe another one for Eric or Carlos. But Eric, I think what you called out for kind of the adjusted FSG margin was over 23%, which is really strong. And I don\u2019t know how much seasonality factored in there, but I would also think you\u2019d have some pricing power in \u201824 because some of the bigger suppliers, I think have called out high single-digit pricing increases for \u201824. So it seems like you have got some bigger room there or even though I know you guys don\u2019t want to be too aggressive, but \u2013 so is something approaching 23% reasonable all-in for 2024 at FSG or are there other factors that we should \u2013 I know Laurans called out inflation and that sort of thing. So how do you think it nets out next year?\nCarlos Macau: Let me take that one, Eric. So hey, Pete, this is Carlos. You have to remember that we have a pretty big amortization flow coming in from the Wencor acquisition. So that\u2019s going to temper some of the, just going to temper the GAAP margin a little bit. I think that it\u2019s going to be a little lumpy throughout the quarters, but I wouldn\u2019t get too proud over your skis. I\u2019ve been talking about the segment doing around 21% margins when things settle when we sort of settle into our footprint. And I think as we are looking forward, that might be a good barometer. We haven\u2019t given guidance, but that\u2019s kind of what I am thinking that the \u201824 is going to look like right now.\nPete Skibitski: Okay and just curious. Go ahead...\nEric Mendelson: I am sorry. And Pete, this is Eric to add, you had asked about pricing. Yes, there is no question that we\u2019ve got pricing upside potential. However, it\u2019s really been our philosophy to pass along our cost increases. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focused on doing to be able to maintain our margins and to continue to provide a lot of opportunities for our customers. So I think that there is a very large potential there. One of the things is as \u2013 if someone\u2019s not buying a part and the OEM has raised the price on the part, then as new customers come in and start buying that part, they pay higher prices. So in a sense, we do get some pricing that way, but we are being very good to our existing customers, and we\u2019re looking very much at our cost increases and cost increases have been significant in a number of areas. I don\u2019t need to tell you about labor and material. And we have been successful in passing along those cost increases because it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to do in order to maintain our margins. As far as the overall operating margin before intangible amortization, I think that we will continue to perform as we have in the past that I\u2019m quite pleased with our performance in the past. And we\u2019ve got a lot of very, very good things in the hopper, a lot of projects where HEICO and Wencor can work together on a number of things. So I\u2019m very optimistic about the future.\nPete Skibitski: I appreciate it guys. And just overall, clear on the amortization, I think you called out $11.8 million in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s kind of the run rate you\u2019re expecting in \u201824 that flows through FSG?\nCarlos Macau: That would be the quarterly run. Are you talking about for just one quarter or for the whole segment?\nPete Skibitski: Well, I think the $11.8 million you referred to was Wencor purchase intangibles amortization. So I\u2019m just wondering that number, how that runs through \u201824.\nCarlos Macau: So it should be about that much each quarter. I will caution you that we\u2019re in the middle of purchase accounting and valuations and all that kind of stuff. So it could move a few ticks to the right or left, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re counting on for next year, each quarter about $11.8 million.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning. And thanks for the question.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nBert Subin: Maybe just to follow-up on that margin question. If we look at FSP margins being dilutive to HEICO, just given where ETG margins are, you noted last quarter, Wencor was in-line with FSG, excluding the amortization piece, which seems to be the case based on your prepared comments, Eric. When you put that together with the synergy opportunity and the broader parts pricing opportunity that we\u2019ve seen on the OEM side, do you think there is a path to overall operating margins getting back to or above FY \u201822 levels in the next, let\u2019s say, 3 years?\nEric Mendelson: Well, so when we look at this past year for the Flight Support Group, in \u201823, our operating margin even after the one-time expenses was about roughly 22%. So we are going to have some additional headwinds as a result of the intangible amortization. But I think that when you add back the intangible amortization, you get into around the 23% area within the Flight Support Group. So I do think that we yes, when you add back the intangible amortization and M&A expense, you get back to the 23%. So I do think that there is additional opportunity for us. But again, as I said, we want to be very protective and make sure we take care of our existing customers who have been buying the existing parts. But there is no question that there is a pricing opportunity. I mean if somebody has not purchased a part from us, our list price would escalate and they would not be able to pay the same price for that part as somebody who had been buying it for a long time. So yes, I think that we do have pricing opportunity on the upside. I want to be careful not to get too far over my skis here because again, we are very customer-friendly, but I do think there is pricing opportunity.\nBert Subin: Okay. Great. And then just as, I guess, a higher-level follow-up, you\u2019ve called out commercial aviation in that end market as being strong. Boeing and Airbus is clearly talking about driving towards target production rates, that are much higher than today\u2019s rates over the next couple of years. Assuming that plays out based on sort of what you know today, how would you expect your Commercial Air end market to change? Do you think they remain fairly similar over that period?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think they remain fairly similar. One of the things that happened for us during the COVID crisis is we got rid of a lot of old aircraft at one-time. So instead of having those headwinds, those headwinds as those older aircraft would have been retired over time, we got rid of them all. So if you look at our sales today, there is been a significant upgrade in the improvement in our fleet age and distribution. So I think that the aircraft that we\u2019re servicing today are going to be out there for a long time. They continue to age 1-year per year, and their price points are very positive for HEICO. So I think that we\u2019re going to have the wind to our backs for many years.\nBert Subin: Thank, so much.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes. Hi, good morning, everybody.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Herbert: Maybe a question, Eric, for you to start off. If you look at HEICO now with Wencor in the combined business. Can you talk organically perhaps how much you\u2019d expect your PMA portfolio, for instance, to grow into \u201824 or \u201825? I guess I\u2019m just curious about what kind of share gain or opportunities you\u2019re seeing in PMA in particular and how you\u2019re investing to support that?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We, both HEICO and Wencor performed very well in terms of new PMA generation. We\u2019re continuing to invest, continuing to find new opportunities. So I mean without doubt, this is going to be a record year in terms of PMA generation and the number of parts that we can come out with. I can tell you that I\u2019ve met with a number of customers since Wencor has closed, and they are really excited and enthusiastic unlike I\u2019ve ever seen, concerning our product line. They want us to do more Again, there is going to be plenty of business for the OEMs. There is more than enough business to go around. But they clearly have seen after going through a supply chain constraint like we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, not only does HEICO bring cost savings, but we also bring availability. And that is a very, very key part of our value proposition. So that is driving them to want to continue to develop more parts with us. And why I\u2019m so bullish on it. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re not going to HEICO-Wencor won\u2019t develop the same parts and we can have each of the business units focused in areas where they have a competitive advantage, and that is our plan to be able to broaden the amount of product that we can bring to our customers.\nKen Herbert: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, thanks, Eric. And maybe, Carlos, if you look at the Wencor business, to the extent to which it\u2019s still sort of stand-alone or independent somewhat. How is the cash generation profile of that business relative to legacy HEICO? And is there an opportunity to maybe see some better cash generation out of the Wencor business?\nCarlos Macau: Ken, it was a little hard to hear that, but it sounds like you\u2019re wondering how we might be able to squeeze more money out of Wencor? Is that essentially your question?\nKen Herbert: Exactly. Yes, sort of the cash profile and the outlook there. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. So I think that on a cash flow for basis from an EBITDA perspective, they are doing quite nicely. They are ahead of our expectations. I think that as we coordinate operations and coordinate our sort of consolidation of some back office things, there may be some savings there. As I mentioned to you before, we\u2019re not going to, we\u2019re not going to disrupt operations right now with any consolidation moves because our end markets are too hot and candidly, they are doing great. And I think that if they continue to do what they did this quarter, we will be very happy. They are not consuming a lot of working capital at the moment. So that\u2019s all a positive going forward in \u201824.\nKen Herbert: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Deuschle: Eric, can you talk a little bit about the munitions growth at FSG? Maybe kind of what the growth has looked like over the last year than what the outlook is going forward into 2024?\nEric Mendelson: I\u2019m sorry, can you just \u2013 the growth of which product line?\nScott Deuschle: The munitions product line, I think, in Specialty Products, I think it was a big driver of growth in the first half of the year. I\u2019m just curious a little more granularity there? Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Got it. Yes. I think what you\u2019re speaking about is the Missile Defense products that we\u2019re doing. And there is a lot of, there is been a tremendous amount of growth as you can imagine in that area. Everybody has been significantly under-invested in it. And for that reason, we\u2019re very optimistic on it. Within our Specialty Products business, we are adding capabilities and space and people to a number of those businesses. So there is a fair amount of, I would say, one-time costs that we\u2019re anticipating in 2024, but we\u2019re going to be able to cover it within our normal margins. But the business is very strong. And I think that we\u2019ve really carved out a niche for ourselves in many areas in the defense products.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. And then Eric, you talked earlier about price and availability being two of the differentiators for what allows you to get the sale on a PMA part. But it seems like another one is that the PMA part is often just a better part. So I\u2019m curious if you could talk a bit about that and how frequently the product itself and the capabilities of the product are what drives the sale? As opposed to just the price and availability piece that you mentioned earlier.\nEric Mendelson: Sure, Scott. I\u2019d be happy to. So in order to get PMA, it\u2019s got, the part has got to be the same in terms of form, fit and function. So therefore, yes, the way that we are able to differentiate ourselves with respect to quality, is we typically have tighter tolerances so we produce more consistent parts. And we also have an extremely robust quality inspection program. So when parts come in from vendors, whether they are HEICO vendors or outside vendors, there is a very robust material analysis, whether the part\u2019s metal or not metal to confirm grain size, microstructure, hardness, coatings, all of those various constituents to ensure that the part that we ship out is exactly what was designed. Likewise, we have a very robust inspection process to review the dimensions. So I would say that with regard to basically shipping the part according to the design intent, HEICO scores incredibly high in that area. So the parts are more consistent. Airlines are able to basically use them and install them right away and the fallout or rejection rate with HEICO parts, we believe, is significantly lower than with other companies\u2019 parts. So they are improved in that regard. We do offer some parts that are improvements where material or dimensions can be changed. But that is a smaller part of our business, but that\u2019s also an area of opportunity for us.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then last question, Carlos. Can you give any kind of framework for how to best think about ETG margins for next year? Is something in the range of 24% to 25%, a good kind of base case framework to think about \u201824? Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Well, I can tell you this for the ETG. I think it\u2019s going to be lumpy. I think the defense sales look like they have turned to our benefit. But we have, as Victor mentioned earlier, we have a lot of high-end reliable parts that are going to non-aerospace defense and space areas. That business, we believe, will calm down a little bit. So the margin is going to go all over the place. I would say if you\u2019re at 24%, you\u2019re probably in the right ballpark for the year. But I would let us get a couple of quarters underneath this before we before we commit to a margin. Because, again, I think based on backlog and what we see right now, it\u2019s going to be a little lumpy going into next year.\nScott Deuschle: Great. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: You are welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. And thank you. Maybe just continuing on that line of questioning with ETG profitability. Victor, can you talk about Exxelia, just to provide us with an update there, the performance of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the underlying profitability profile of the business and kind of how that tempers into your fiscal \u201824 expectations as just Carlos just said as well as beyond that period.\nVictor Mendelson: Sure, Sheila. So Exxelia has been doing pretty much exactly what we expected it to do, more or less right on plan. The business has been growing. And I, as we\u2019ve said before, that penalizes our operating margin by about 200 basis points. And I would expect that to probably continue to be the case. I would expect their margins will march up a bit over time, but not to the level of the rest of the ETG. So we\u2019re very happy to have the business. They have mined out a lot of new opportunities. They are working on other opportunities beyond that. Continuing good product development, producing out their backlog, which has been very strong. So overall, very happy and very happy with the people there.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thans for that color. And maybe, Eric, one for you. I know you got lots of questions on price. Any way you could quantify cumulative price over the last, since 2019 for us? And also, any thoughts on the GTF issues and how you think that will potentially benefit HEICO\u2019s PMA portfolio?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, good morning, Sheila. Great question. With regard to price action, I don\u2019t have that information in front of me. And due to HEICO\u2019s decentralized nature, it would be very difficult to pull all of that together. But I would say that in general, we have not, as I said before, we have not pushed price beyond our cost increases. So therefore, customers who have been purchasing the parts for a long time have been treated very well and it\u2019s our plan to continue doing that. But of course new people buy the parts, and they haven\u2019t purchased the parts in the past, they pay the newer price, and that would reflect increased prices as our labor and material costs have gone up. So, and then with regard to the GTF, I assume that will keep the existing fleet in great demand for a long time. It\u2019s going to take a while to work through the GTF problems. And I have no question that they\u2019ll ultimately get through them. But in the meantime, that should be really a very strong indicator, I would say, for the aftermarket. And fortunately, these aircraft are able to pick up the slack. So I think that, that\u2019s working out quite nicely. Originally, we always said that whenever you got a recovery, there is always a little bit of an overshoot. Well, it looks like perhaps as a result of the GTF issue that overshoot may either be delayed or won\u2019t happen, because there is just increased demand. Our backlogs are tremendous. Our suppliers are challenged to keep up I think we\u2019re doing better than most in that regard, but there is tremendous, there continues to be tremendous demand for our products and services.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice results. And thanks for taking the questions here. Carlos, just can you give us any more maybe clarity or direction on the revenue growth outlook for \u201824? I mean, I know you called out in the press release, you expect growth in FSG and ETG, assuming FSG will be lapping a tough comp on the 20% organic, so maybe unlikely to see acceleration there. But I would think with ETG and defense kind of showing that sequential improvement. We get some acceleration of this 1%. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on kind of the top line growth expectations?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I mean, as we\u2019re sitting here today, our growth is going to be solid next year from acquisition revenue. If you\u2019re referring to organic, you are right. We\u2019re lapping 20% plus growth quarters for 2 years now. So I think what, in the FSG, I think that will be, I don\u2019t think it will continue at that rate, Michael. I mean it could, but I\u2019m not anticipating that. I do think it peels back a little bit. Not a ton, but it will peel back, I think the ETG\u2019s growth is going to be quite lumpy based on what we see in backlog right now. And I think with the ETG, if you\u2019re counting on the organic side, look to the low to mid-single digits. FSG should be high single to double digits, something like that. It should continue a nice growth next year.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just back to the FSG margins, I guess, as you guys think about kind of the integration plans, Wencor had been running at 15.8%, give or take. Where do you think you can take those margins? And I know, Carlos, you called out a couple of times the amortization from Wencor to $11.8 million flowing through. But what was the other amortization as well that flows through there to kind of get to that 23%? Just want to make sure we\u2019ve got all the math correct.\nCarlos Macau: Michael, are you talking about just Wencor or the segment?\nMichael Ciarmoli: The first question was just on Wencor. The second was the segment in total at that 23%.\nCarlos Macau: So I think that percent of sales are going to run 2%, 2.5%, I believe, is the number for amortization in the segment and Wencor is part of that. And like I said, you\u2019re close to $12 million a quarter for Wencor in amortization. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at next year.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. Got it. And then any thoughts on where you could take those Wencor margins, like just that, from that 15.8% level as you guys integrate and kind of go through the process?\nEric Mendelson: So Michael, this is Eric. Let me see if I can help you out with that a little bit. If you take the Wencor operating income for the quarter, of $29.3 million and then you add back the $11.8 million of intangible amortization, then you get to a number of about $41 million for the quarter. So when you divide that $41 million by the $186 million approximately of Wencor sales get to about 22% margin adding back the intangible amortization. So if we\u2019re saying that HEICO is, Flight Support Group is going to be in the 23% area for this coming year. Wencor based on the fourth quarter was just a tick below that. To just, but I would say it\u2019s very similar, very similar to HEICO.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Prefect. Thanks, guys. I will jump back in the queue.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: A couple of questions. First, Eric, I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen any differences in demand by channel? Wencor, I think you guys said sells more to the MRO, whereas HEICO on the PMA side directly to the airlines. Was there any discernible differences or changes in customer pager between the two channels?\nEric Mendelson: No, I would say there really hasn\u2019t been thus far. I think that, that is an opportunity for us to mine, as we go forward. And I think that, that will be very much an opportunity. Again, Wencor has operated basically as a stand-alone business. Yes, we\u2019re coordinating some activities, but it continues to operate with its own leadership and its own P&L. And, but I think there will be opportunities, such as the ones you\u2019re alluding to.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And Airlines appear to be in some financial distress incrementally. I\u2019m just curious, has that, have you seen any increase in the number of inquiries from non-PMA buying customers that are now looking to switch over? Or just you\u2019re seeing more volume among certain customers than you would expect at the airlines given some of the challenges?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And they are, I mean, pretty much everybody uses PMAs, but there has been an increase in using parts that using HEICO parts that they haven\u2019t purchased in the past. And what is it the old saying Necessity is the motherhood of invention. And sometimes people can\u2019t get apart from the OEM, then they\u2019ll go ahead and then they\u2019ll buy it from HEICO. And we certainly have seen that happen. And as a matter of fact, it\u2019s particularly gratifying when you see OEMs do that. So, and that\u2019s been, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics, obviously, but it\u2019s very nice when we see OEMs purchasing the HEICO and the Wencor alternative parts in order to meet their demand because we know the quality is outstanding.\nGautam Khanna: Appreciate it. And then, Victor, just quickly on some of the earlier questions related to the defense improvement that you saw sequentially. What, is this a letup of past due backlog? Or is there, is that not really a driver? And what can you say about maybe book-to-bill or any sort of discernible change in order trends among those customers?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. On defense, I think our book-to-bill is positive on defense, and moving in the right direction. For our defense businesses, I would say, very little of it, if any, would be supply chain catch up. In fact, quarter, in the whole quarter, we, our companies estimate that maybe approximately $10 million worth of shipments moved to the right, right? So compare that to where we were, I don\u2019t know, roughly a year ago, I think we reached up in the $40 million range or even higher. So that\u2019s definitely trended in the right direction for us and overall optimistic on our defense business throughout the year. Again, as Carlos emphasized, it will be lumpy. And the mix sensitivity is important, because we have some products, some subsidiaries, which have a much higher margin than others and how that backlog falls out is very important. So, I would expect, for example, the first quarter on margin side to be tougher for us than the following quarters.\nGautam Khanna: Last one, if I may, just back to Eric. On the number of PMA parts you expect to introduce between the two entities, legacy HEICO and Wencor, can you just update us on that over the next year.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think HEICO has been running in that 300 to 500 area, roughly 400 parts a year, and Wencor has been running in about 150 area, so I would anticipate those numbers continuing that way.\nGautam Khanna: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. Wish you happy holidays.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nLouie DiPalma: Larry, Eric, Victor and Carlos, good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: When discussing the Wencore deal, Wencor\u2019s e-commerce platform was touted as one of the unique assets with potential synergies. Has HEICO started the process of selling any of the HEICO parts on the Wencor online marketplace? And are there many revenue and cost synergy projects planned for 2024, or is that more of a 2025 event? Thanks.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. This is Eric. I would be happy Louie, to answer that. As I mentioned, the HEICO philosophy when we acquire a business is just to leave it alone and observe what\u2019s going on. We have got our initial view, and then we want to make sure we confirm that first before making substantial changes. So yes, the ownership period of Wencor has gone extremely well. And we are working on a number of projects in terms of product rationalization, sharing resources between the businesses, sending business to HEICO-Wencor, which used to go outside. So, all of that is going well. Specifically with regard to the e-commerce platform, we think that that\u2019s going to be an opportunity for 2024. It\u2019s something that we are looking at right now. We continue to believe very much that\u2019s going to be a huge asset. They are studying the best way to go ahead and do that. But no, we have not done it to-date, not because we don\u2019t want to do it, but because frankly, both businesses are running at such a high percentage of utilization that we don\u2019t have people to be able to focus on all of the projects that we are just sort of taking them as we can handle them. But we believe that that\u2019s going to be a tremendous benefit for us in 2024.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And a follow-up on that, in terms of the cost synergies, then you said that you plan to let Wencor operate in a standalone mode. Should we think of synergies more as a 2025 event then? Like how long would you generally plan to let it operate in a standalone mode?\nEric Mendelson: Well, I think the revenue synergies are going to start accruing quickly. And then as far as some of the cost synergies, the business units are taking it upon themselves to work together and to find areas where they can rationalize product lines. If one business does more of a particular product than another, they are looking at swapping. So this way, we can maintain the workforces. We have got tremendous volumes and all the businesses are running at a high utilization factor. So, but if we can redirect people to more efficient activities, we want to do that. So, we are taking advantage of the revenue synergies and of some of the cost synergies, but I would say that that\u2019s going to be something that benefits us in both \u201824 and \u201825.\nLouie DiPalma: Excellent. Thanks Eric and thanks everyone.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLarry Solow: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Happy holidays to everybody. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one, I guess on \u2013 just on free cash flow, a couple there. Sort of you are \u2013 without getting specific guidance sort of your general outlook on free cash flow in terms of working capital needs, do you expect maybe have to build a little more inventory? How do you think that\u2019s going to shake out? And then part to that question would be kind of priorities for free cash flow. A little more leverage than you guys are used to. So, I am just curious, would that number one priority be sort of debt pay down, maybe in front of even strategic acquisitions? Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: So, let me take a stab at that, Larry. It\u2019s Carlos. I think that on the \u2013 as you mentioned, the inventories side, we did have a significant investment in \u201823 in inventory. And I suspect that for a few quarters into \u201824, we might have a little bit more inventory build. Part of that is due to firm commitment orders we place, sometimes as much as 2 years ago, to deal with the supply chain challenges to make sure we had product on the shelf for our customers. But I do think that carrying costs and inventory isn\u2019t free anymore, right. Rates are up, so we are very cognizant of that. And I do think as we get into \u201824, my hope is, is that towards the back half of the year, we get a little bit more rationalization on the working capital usage. That\u2019s my expectation. As far as free cash flow, I expect the company to continue to have strong free cash flows. And I do think you have hit the nail on the head. Once the working capital investment to support the growth and some of these firm commitment orders has tempered, I think our conversion will be slightly [Technical Difficulty]. Does that answer your question, Larry?\nLarry Solow: Yes. Absolutely. And I guess just priority. Debt pay down, is that probably the priority or\u2026?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. Look, I mean our objective right now as we stated before, is to try and de-lever as quick as possible. Our plan after completing the Wencor acquisition within 12 months to 18 months, we set out on a plan to get our debt leverage ratio, something close to normal, around the 2% range, roughly. That\u2019s the goal of the 12 months to 18 months, I would say that, that is not a goal that prohibits us from doing acquisitions. I would say that for smaller acquisitions we will draw on our line to do what we need to do to complete those if they are good for our shareholders. I think if they are larger deals, we might have to get creative, but I don\u2019t expect that over the next 12 months to 18 months, something as large as Wencor probably would be very unique. I don\u2019t know that we have got something on the horizon right now. And I do think, to your point, that deleveraging is sort of our highest and best use of free cash right now.\nLarry Solow: Excellent. Okay. Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Yes.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning everyone. This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. I am going to ask a big picture question. Larry, in your prepared remarks you highlighted, you have never been more optimistic about HEICO\u2019s future than you are today. When you think about the year ahead, what are you most excited about, if the industry is a particular end market, it\u2019s HEICO competitive position?\nLaurans Mendelson: I think all of the above and other areas, too. I think that the Wencor acquisition puts us in a very unique spot. As we have told you today, it\u2019s actually working out better than we anticipated. To HEICO, the culture of a company is critical. And I can tell you, as a large acquisition like Wencor, having that excellent culture is really a wonderful thing. We have learned \u2013 I am a financial person, originally started as a CPA long ago, and finance is very important. And we key on that, of course, in cash. But when I look at our cash flow and I look at our culture, the culture is what ultimately drives the bottom line. So, this is very, very good. On the other hand, the Exxelia acquisition has come off almost exactly what we expected. So and we expected it to be good, and it is good. So, when I look at all these things and the size of the company, I also believe that, as a matter of fact, I have said many times that we have a goal of growing 15% to 20% bottom line. And in \u201823, if you add back those non-recurring expenses that we incurred, the legal investment banking and so forth for the acquisition, we grew about 20% over the prior year \u201822. I feel very confident that in the current year, we will be able to grow 15% or 20%. We don\u2019t give guidance, but clearly, we focus on our budgets and where we think we will wind up. But I feel knowing everything I know now that we will be able to repeat a 15%, 20% growth. So \u2013 and then that\u2019s after making these sizable acquisitions and digesting them. So, HEICO is a much stronger, bigger company than it has ever been. I mean it\u2019s a major factor today in this, in the industries we operate. So, for all those reasons, I would say HEICO has become a powerhouse, and for those reasons, I feel extremely confident of the future for HEICO. Does that answer your question?\nMariana Perez Mora: Yes. Thanks so much. And then when you think about potential challenges, what keeps you up at night, gets you up at night? Like where are you like paying close attention to?\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, the only thing that I worry about is exogenous events, which we can\u2019t control or strange things like this. But as far as the operation of HEICO, I am highly confident because we have great depth in management. In other words, since we are a company that\u2019s not consolidated. We are diversified and we leave the decision-making down at the level where we believe it belongs. So, corporate doesn\u2019t tell the operating entities, what they have to do. We say to them, what do you think we should do, and how will you accomplish it in your budget. And to that extent, I have great confidence. These are people who have been running these businesses for many years. Nobody, in my opinion, nobody knows their market, their labor market, their customer market better than the people operating the businesses. So and they have done it over and over and over again. So, it\u2019s not as though, well, this is something new, can they do it, can they accomplish it, no. They have been doing this for many years. I mean HEICO has a record of growing over 30-some years, the bottom line close to 20% compounded growth. So, because of that, I have great, great confidence in what they are doing. I mean Eric and Victor run those companies, and they go out and they meet with the business unit leaders constantly. They speak to them by phone. Carlos has an extremely detailed financial report weekly. So, we keep track of the receivables of growth, the backlog, cash flows, everything. So, for all those reasons, I really don\u2019t worry about the operation of our company. I just worry about, but I don\u2019t worry about it because I can\u2019t control it. The things like COVID, wars and things like that, which might impact us. But I can\u2019t change that. I think we have done as well, Eric, Victor and our team members have done as well as can be done with the company in terms of operations and control, so none of those things worry me.\nMariana Perez Mora: Perfect. Thanks so much. And then if I may, one last question for Carlos. Could we please dig deeper on M&A? I am curious if you could discuss the two sides of it, like, number One, like pipeline of opportunities and like how \u2013 any color on pricing there? But also you mentioned deleveraging. What is the targeted leverage? And I am curious how and if the an easing interest rate environment influences that target?\nCarlos Macau: Well, clearly, higher interest rates causes me to want to pay down debt quicker, right. I mean that\u2019s kind of our motor operation here. Within the next 12 months to 18 months, I am targeting somewhere in the low 2x, and that gets us close to historic norms, which have been somewhere slightly lower than 2x. That was the goal when we set out, and that\u2019s what our objectives are. As far as our \u2013 as far as M&A backlog goes, we have a very active process, both segments have teams that are focused on markets and opportunities. It\u2019s very opportunistic. And as I mentioned earlier, there will be those handful of deals that we see every year, which I would probably categorize a smaller, $100 million spend and less and things like that. We will find deals like that all day long, and if it makes sense for our shareholders, we will pull the trigger. That won\u2019t damage our plan to de-lever. But as far as larger deals, such as Wencor where we spent over $2 billion, I would think over the next 12 months to 18 months that, that would be unlikely that we would pursue something like that until we have de-levered a bit\u2026\nMariana Perez Mora: Perfect. Thanks so much and yes that\u2019s perfect. Thanks so much and happy holidays to everyone.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ian Franz Engelberg [ph] with Baird. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning Larry, Eric, Victor and Carlos. Thanks for taking the question.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Eric, if I can just sort of a high-level question, just over the next 12 months, in terms of flight activity across narrow-body, wide-body and then sort of North America, Europe and China. If you can just let us know how you are thinking about sort of potential areas of strength and potential regions where there is a watch item for your business for the aftermarket?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We are seeing strength, frankly, across the board. So, we dive down into the part number level. So, it\u2019s just very, very broad-based strength straight across the board. So, I wouldn\u2019t want to call out one area or another. It\u2019s really just very strong across the board.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, that makes sense. Thank you. And if I could just have a quick follow-up, Victor, I think you may have answered just with ETG. But if you could just talk about sort of the supply chain outlook in 2024 and beyond, so there is less of an impact. I think you guys mentioned $10 million. Does that keep on improving for the remainder of \u201824?\nVictor Mendelson: I would expect that to be the case. I think it\u2019s improved dramatically, but there is still room to go. Lead times have improved. Of course, there are some products. There are some components particularly when the realm one would think of as \u201cChips\u201d, that\u2019s still elevated and a little complicated. And I would say even in ordinary times, as I reflect on it, I would expect that there will always be products and vendors that are delayed, but we wouldn\u2019t categorize it as a supply chain crunch like the world experienced before. And so I think it will return to normal at some time, I would expect within calendar 2024.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you. Thanks, and happy holidays and congrats on a good quarter. I will jump back.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Thank you, and good morning guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nLouis Raffetto: Victor, so it\u2019s great to see defense up again. I guess have we lapped year-over-year growth yet? I know it was down high-single digits last year or last quarter for defense. I guess, was it up this quarter?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, it was up this quarter.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Eric, just can you help baseline $186 million of sales for Wencor between sort of the sub-segments within FSC? Any way you could help us out there?\nEric Mendelson: I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have that actually in front of me right now. But it would fall broadly into parts and into MRO in terms of the disaggregation of revenue. But I don\u2019t have that information in front of me at the moment. But I would say that we are doing very well in both of those areas.\nLouis Raffetto: Alright. Great. Appreciate it. And then Carlos, just to make sure we are all based on, I guess on the interest cost in the quarter. Was there anything one-time, or should we think of this $40 million level as sort of going into fiscal year \u201824 as the right level?\nCarlos Macau: And Louis, that\u2019s a good question. So, within the interest line this quarter, we had a $3.8 million worth of one-time costs in there related to the commitment letter to fund the Wencor deal. So, going into there, we basically had to pay about $3.8 million to get a bank to write a letter to say that we are good for the purchase price. That\u2019s the one-timer, that won\u2019t repeat. So, as you are looking forward next year, if you pull that out, you are looking at roughly $38 million and then decreasing as we de-lever.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And then I guess, just taxes, any way to think about taxes for next year?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I hope they remain. I am planning on them to remain similar to what they were this year. I always kind of count on a 20% to 21% rate, this year, we have did a little better. It\u2019s because, frankly, we have that leadership compensation plan where we have some tax deferred earnings that has a positive impact on our rate and because the market was generally up through \u201823 for our fiscal year, that did help us as opposed to hurting us last year. So, I think if you are in the 20% to 21% range, you are going to be in good shape.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And then just last clean-up on the intangible amortization, was there no sort of one-time step-ups or anything like that, that $11.8 million was, to your point, sort of the go-forward rate?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, it was. The one thing about, Wencor doesn\u2019t have what I will call a manufacturing base like we do. They outsource a lot of their manufacturing. So, there wasn\u2019t any manufacturing profit to pull out of the purchase accounting to pull out of the numbers. I mean maybe a little bit on the repair side, but it wasn\u2019t anything notable, Louis. So, I would say that $11.8 million is a pretty good run rate number.\nLouis Raffetto: Alright. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: You bet.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital. Please go ahead.\nColin Ducharme: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I had actually one clarification for Eric and then one question for Carlos, if I may. Eric, on the GTF question earlier, could you just please clarify your impression of the materiality of that potential demand driver for 2024. Do you view that as an incremental needle mover for you all? And then do you have any additional certifications, etcetera, that your subsidiaries perhaps need to attain to win that work and then you have the capacity to kind of take that on? And then for Carlos, just stepping back and thinking of the post Wencor and Exxelia balance sheet that you are sitting on now, you are facing one of the most significant de-levering processes in recent memory for HEICO. And we have just witnessed a significant and favorable change to financial market conditions in the last month or so. And while I am no macroeconomist, things could continue to favorably develop here in 2024. So, I just wanted to ask about your thinking and has it changed at all regarding the cost or pace of this de-levering journey that you are on. Any change to your thinking and/or steps as you kind of prosecute that playbook? Thanks again.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Colin, so I will start out. What I was referring to in response to the prior question, concerning the GTF was that as a result of the GTF-powered aircraft being taken out of service in order to have their engines overhauled, that would create additional demand for legacy aircraft. So, I don\u2019t want to call that out as anything more than a tailwind. But clearly, it\u2019s going to be good for the use of the utilization of non-GTF powered aircraft. With regard to HEICO\u2019s involvement in the GTF campaign, I would say that it is not material. We are not supplying PMAs on the GTF in any material quantity. And frankly, the service that\u2019s being done now is being paid by the manufacturer. So, that would not be a revenue opportunity for us. If we have got businesses that are supplying parts into the OEM, then there could be a little bit of increased demand for that. But no, I would not call it out as a special one-time item.\nCarlos Macau: Colin, this is Carlos. I don\u2019t know that anything on the horizon is going to change my view on the de-levering. In my mind, we have got almost 10,000 team members and uncountably [ph] number of family members that are attached to those people, and we want to make sure we have a battle hardened company that has a lot of staying power. And so my objective with that in mind is to try and de-lever as quick as possible, so we could de-risk the balance sheet. I will tell you this, I mean at net leverage at 3x, it\u2019s not like we are highly levered. But for me, I would prefer to be back down to historical norms. So, that\u2019s kind of the marching orders into the next couple of years, and we will see how it plays out. I can tell you, we will not miss opportunities that are good for our shareholders as a result of that plan. But the stated goals right now are to continue the thoughts of de-levering. Does that answer your question?\nColin Ducharme: Yes. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jordan Lines [ph] with Bank of America. Please go ahead. It appears they have disconnected and we have no additional questions at this time.\nLaurans Mendelson: Okay. Well, thank you very much. I want to thank everybody who has been listening to this call. I hope we have satisfied you and give you information that you would like, if not, we are available, as you know, give us a call, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself. And we look forward to speaking to you in the first quarter call, which will be in a few months from now. And we wish all of you a very happy, healthy holiday season, and New Year. And that\u2019s the end of this call.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Yes, Rob, this is Carlos. I would say that you have to remember that when we put the 8-K out, we had pro forma sales in there, which, as you know, Wencor has some acquisitions early in \u201823 and so that's probably why you are seeing sort of exponential growth. I really, to be honest, haven't gone back and calculated the organic as we just bought them. I will tell you that we were counting on about $724 million in pro forma sales. I mean if you just divide that before, we would expect at $181 million, they delivered almost $186 million. So we are pleased with the sales growth. I would say that Q4 is typically a little bit more richer than some of the other quarters when it comes to aerospace sales. So, none of this is unexpected. But no, they had a great year. And to Eric's point, they are performing at the same rate that the overall FSG is, particularly in the parts business. Let me take that one, Eric. So hey, Pete, this is Carlos. You have to remember that we have a pretty big amortization flow coming in from the Wencor acquisition. So that's going to temper some of the, just going to temper the GAAP margin a little bit. I think that it's going to be a little lumpy throughout the quarters, but I wouldn't get too proud over your skis. I've been talking about the segment doing around 21% margins when things settle when we sort of settle into our footprint. And I think as we are looking forward, that might be a good barometer. We haven't given guidance, but that's kind of what I am thinking that the \u201824 is going to look like right now. That would be the quarterly run. Are you talking about for just one quarter or for the whole segment? So it should be about that much each quarter. I will caution you that we're in the middle of purchase accounting and valuations and all that kind of stuff. So it could move a few ticks to the right or left, but that's what we're counting on for next year, each quarter about $11.8 million. Ken, it was a little hard to hear that, but it sounds like you're wondering how we might be able to squeeze more money out of Wencor? Is that essentially your question? Sure. So I think that on a cash flow for basis from an EBITDA perspective, they are doing quite nicely. They are ahead of our expectations. I think that as we coordinate operations and coordinate our sort of consolidation of some back office things, there may be some savings there. As I mentioned to you before, we're not going to, we're not going to disrupt operations right now with any consolidation moves because our end markets are too hot and candidly, they are doing great. And I think that if they continue to do what they did this quarter, we will be very happy. They are not consuming a lot of working capital at the moment. So that's all a positive going forward in \u201824. Well, I can tell you this for the ETG. I think it's going to be lumpy. I think the defense sales look like they have turned to our benefit. But we have, as Victor mentioned earlier, we have a lot of high-end reliable parts that are going to non-aerospace defense and space areas. That business, we believe, will calm down a little bit. So the margin is going to go all over the place. I would say if you're at 24%, you're probably in the right ballpark for the year. But I would let us get a couple of quarters underneath this before we before we commit to a margin. Because, again, I think based on backlog and what we see right now, it's going to be a little lumpy going into next year. You are welcome. Well, I mean, as we're sitting here today, our growth is going to be solid next year from acquisition revenue. If you're referring to organic, you are right. We're lapping 20% plus growth quarters for 2 years now. So I think what, in the FSG, I think that will be, I don't think it will continue at that rate, Michael. I mean it could, but I'm not anticipating that. I do think it peels back a little bit. Not a ton, but it will peel back, I think the ETG's growth is going to be quite lumpy based on what we see in backlog right now. And I think with the ETG, if you're counting on the organic side, look to the low to mid-single digits. FSG should be high single to double digits, something like that. It should continue a nice growth next year. Michael, are you talking about just Wencor or the segment? So I think that percent of sales are going to run 2%, 2.5%, I believe, is the number for amortization in the segment and Wencor is part of that. And like I said, you're close to $12 million a quarter for Wencor in amortization. So that's what we're looking at next year. So, let me take a stab at that, Larry. It's Carlos. I think that on the \u2013 as you mentioned, the inventories side, we did have a significant investment in \u201823 in inventory. And I suspect that for a few quarters into \u201824, we might have a little bit more inventory build. Part of that is due to firm commitment orders we place, sometimes as much as 2 years ago, to deal with the supply chain challenges to make sure we had product on the shelf for our customers. But I do think that carrying costs and inventory isn't free anymore, right. Rates are up, so we are very cognizant of that. And I do think as we get into \u201824, my hope is, is that towards the back half of the year, we get a little bit more rationalization on the working capital usage. That's my expectation. As far as free cash flow, I expect the company to continue to have strong free cash flows. And I do think you have hit the nail on the head. Once the working capital investment to support the growth and some of these firm commitment orders has tempered, I think our conversion will be slightly [Technical Difficulty]. Does that answer your question, Larry? Yes. Look, I mean our objective right now as we stated before, is to try and de-lever as quick as possible. Our plan after completing the Wencor acquisition within 12 months to 18 months, we set out on a plan to get our debt leverage ratio, something close to normal, around the 2% range, roughly. That's the goal of the 12 months to 18 months, I would say that, that is not a goal that prohibits us from doing acquisitions. I would say that for smaller acquisitions we will draw on our line to do what we need to do to complete those if they are good for our shareholders. I think if they are larger deals, we might have to get creative, but I don't expect that over the next 12 months to 18 months, something as large as Wencor probably would be very unique. I don't know that we have got something on the horizon right now. And I do think, to your point, that deleveraging is sort of our highest and best use of free cash right now. Yes. Well, clearly, higher interest rates causes me to want to pay down debt quicker, right. I mean that's kind of our motor operation here. Within the next 12 months to 18 months, I am targeting somewhere in the low 2x, and that gets us close to historic norms, which have been somewhere slightly lower than 2x. That was the goal when we set out, and that's what our objectives are. As far as our \u2013 as far as M&A backlog goes, we have a very active process, both segments have teams that are focused on markets and opportunities. It's very opportunistic. And as I mentioned earlier, there will be those handful of deals that we see every year, which I would probably categorize a smaller, $100 million spend and less and things like that. We will find deals like that all day long, and if it makes sense for our shareholders, we will pull the trigger. That won't damage our plan to de-lever. But as far as larger deals, such as Wencor where we spent over $2 billion, I would think over the next 12 months to 18 months that, that would be unlikely that we would pursue something like that until we have de-levered a bit... Thank you. Yes, it was up this quarter. And Louis, that's a good question. So, within the interest line this quarter, we had a $3.8 million worth of one-time costs in there related to the commitment letter to fund the Wencor deal. So, going into there, we basically had to pay about $3.8 million to get a bank to write a letter to say that we are good for the purchase price. That's the one-timer, that won't repeat. So, as you are looking forward next year, if you pull that out, you are looking at roughly $38 million and then decreasing as we de-lever. Yes. I hope they remain. I am planning on them to remain similar to what they were this year. I always kind of count on a 20% to 21% rate, this year, we have did a little better. It's because, frankly, we have that leadership compensation plan where we have some tax deferred earnings that has a positive impact on our rate and because the market was generally up through \u201823 for our fiscal year, that did help us as opposed to hurting us last year.

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 28% to a record $342.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $268.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal \u201823 and \u201822 acquisitions as well as 6% organic growth. The organic net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 mainly resulted from increased net sales of defense, space and commercial aviation products, partially offset by lower net sales of other electronics products. We are pleased to see 26% sequential growth in defense product net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 over the prior quarter, which now marks our third consecutive quarter of defense-related net sales growth. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 8% to a record $86.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The operating income increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by higher costs from the Exxelia acquisition, higher performance-based compensation expense and unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent compensation. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 25.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 as compared to 29.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. As acquisitions intangible amortization is equal to approximately 400 basis points from our sales, we view that our ETG businesses achieved a roughly 29% margin from their, what we consider to be their true operational activities, which is excellent by any measure. And we are very happy with it even if it is not as high as it was before. I also note that in last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $3 million gain from contingent consideration reversal. So last year's fourth quarter operating income included that gain, while this year, we had the opposite effect, which reduced the operating margin in total between the 2 years by around 140 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. All of this is why I look at what we consider to be the businesses' actual performance before non-cash acquisition accounting. And that, as I said before, is excellent in absolute terms. The lower operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, as we said, principally reflects the previously mentioned higher costs from the Exxelia acquisition, the unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of contingent compensation and higher performance-based compensation. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes, hey, Rob, it's good to talk with you. And it's a good question as always. So I think our strongest market right now and what's the biggest driver has been commercial aviation. And we have a few businesses in the ETG that have been particularly strong as a result of multiple factors. Some of it is the recovery in air travel. Some of it is new products that we have introduced. Some of it is also some efficiency initiatives and some of it is acquisition related. So it's a broad mix there. Defense is definitely moving in the right direction for us as well. The \u2013 and commercial space is holding in pretty nicely overall for us. There are pockets of weakness here and there. But overall, it's pretty good for us. I would say the headwind for us and I mentioned this before, I think over the last year, I signaled this probably a year or more ago that I thought some of our high-end non-aerospace and defense markets would start to turn down this year. And those have been more difficult. So, those markets that serve some high-end electronics, medical and markets like those are definitely trending in the opposite direction. And I would expect that will continue for some time. And I think we will see the effects of that over the next few quarters, actually, first quarter in particular and as we go on into the year before that starts to reverse. And that's principally a result of probably overly aggressive ordering by customers during the supply chain crunch dealing with the same kinds of things that we were dealing with. They wanted to get out ahead of it. And now the deliveries are coming in and some of their orders maybe slower, so they have to correct their inventory levels. Sure, Sheila. So Exxelia has been doing pretty much exactly what we expected it to do, more or less right on plan. The business has been growing. And I, as we've said before, that penalizes our operating margin by about 200 basis points. And I would expect that to probably continue to be the case. I would expect their margins will march up a bit over time, but not to the level of the rest of the ETG. So we're very happy to have the business. They have mined out a lot of new opportunities. They are working on other opportunities beyond that. Continuing good product development, producing out their backlog, which has been very strong. So overall, very happy and very happy with the people there. Yes. On defense, I think our book-to-bill is positive on defense, and moving in the right direction. For our defense businesses, I would say, very little of it, if any, would be supply chain catch up. In fact, quarter, in the whole quarter, we, our companies estimate that maybe approximately $10 million worth of shipments moved to the right, right? So compare that to where we were, I don't know, roughly a year ago, I think we reached up in the $40 million range or even higher. So that's definitely trended in the right direction for us and overall optimistic on our defense business throughout the year. Again, as Carlos emphasized, it will be lumpy. And the mix sensitivity is important, because we have some products, some subsidiaries, which have a much higher margin than others and how that backlog falls out is very important. So, I would expect, for example, the first quarter on margin side to be tougher for us than the following quarters. I would expect that to be the case. I think it's improved dramatically, but there is still room to go. Lead times have improved. Of course, there are some products. There are some components particularly when the realm one would think of as \u201cChips\u201d, that's still elevated and a little complicated. And I would say even in ordinary times, as I reflect on it, I would expect that there will always be products and vendors that are delayed, but we wouldn't categorize it as a supply chain crunch like the world experienced before. And so I think it will return to normal at some time, I would expect within calendar 2024."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Samara. Good morning to everyone on this call, and we thank you very much for joining us, and we welcome you to the HEICO fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another strong quarter and strong year. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence has translated into superb results for the shareholders. I would also like to congratulate and thank the Wencor team for a terrific quarter within the HEICO family. We could not be more pleased with their performance and their results. I personally continue to be very optimistic about the future for HEICO. And as a matter of fact, I have never been more optimistic about HEICO's future than I am today. I will now summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 record results. Consolidated fourth quarter fiscal \u201823 operating income and net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group and Electronic Technologies Group, mainly arising from continued strong demand for our commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal \u201823 and \u201822 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 improved by 29% and 54% respectively as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. These results mainly reflect 14% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the impact from the acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 6% to $103.4 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and that was up from $97.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. In connection with the Wencor acquisition, HEICO incurred acquisition cost during the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and they decreased net income attributable to HEICO by approximately $13.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Our consolidated operating margins before the Wencor related non-recurring deal expenses remain strong and are consistent with the expectations we have previously communicated. These margins are extremely healthy, even though our product mix this year has meant lower overall margins than in prior year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, excluding the Wencor acquisition cost, consolidated net income increased 20% to $117 million or $0.84 per diluted share. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.04x as of October 31, \u201823 and that compares to 0.25x as of October 31, \u201822. The net debt to EBITDA ratio increased in the fiscal year ending October 31, \u201823 principally reflects our successful offering of $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes and increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of Wencor. Cash flow provided by operating activities improved to $148.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and that was up from $143.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. Cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support our increased consolidated backlog. The continued excellent cash flow generation by HEICO permitted our Board of Directors to recently declare a $0.10 per share semiannual dividend, which represents our 91st consecutive dividend payment. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal \u201824, we anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support Group and the Electronic Technologies Group and that will be driven by contributions from our fiscal \u201823 acquisitions as well as the demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures may lead to higher material and labor costs. We plan to actively work on Wencor's ongoing integration into our business and operations, continue our commitment to developing new products and services and further market penetration while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. Our operating margins, especially before non-recurring acquisition expenses remain extremely healthy and reflect our strong business operations. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies and strong cash flow enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of strategic acquisition opportunities, which collectively position HEICO for success in the markets that we serve. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Their persistent drive and determination to win in the marketplace has resulted in another quarter of outstanding results. Thank you all team members for everything you do to make HEICO a great company. And now, Samantha, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Good morning, Rob. Good morning Louie. I think all of the above and other areas, too. I think that the Wencor acquisition puts us in a very unique spot. As we have told you today, it's actually working out better than we anticipated. To HEICO, the culture of a company is critical. And I can tell you, as a large acquisition like Wencor, having that excellent culture is really a wonderful thing. We have learned \u2013 I am a financial person, originally started as a CPA long ago, and finance is very important. And we key on that, of course, in cash. But when I look at our cash flow and I look at our culture, the culture is what ultimately drives the bottom line. So, this is very, very good. On the other hand, the Exxelia acquisition has come off almost exactly what we expected. So and we expected it to be good, and it is good. So, when I look at all these things and the size of the company, I also believe that, as a matter of fact, I have said many times that we have a goal of growing 15% to 20% bottom line. And in \u201823, if you add back those non-recurring expenses that we incurred, the legal investment banking and so forth for the acquisition, we grew about 20% over the prior year \u201822. I feel very confident that in the current year, we will be able to grow 15% or 20%. We don't give guidance, but clearly, we focus on our budgets and where we think we will wind up. But I feel knowing everything I know now that we will be able to repeat a 15%, 20% growth. So \u2013 and then that's after making these sizable acquisitions and digesting them. So, HEICO is a much stronger, bigger company than it has ever been. I mean it's a major factor today in this, in the industries we operate. So, for all those reasons, I would say HEICO has become a powerhouse, and for those reasons, I feel extremely confident of the future for HEICO. Does that answer your question? Well, the only thing that I worry about is exogenous events, which we can't control or strange things like this. But as far as the operation of HEICO, I am highly confident because we have great depth in management. In other words, since we are a company that's not consolidated. We are diversified and we leave the decision-making down at the level where we believe it belongs. So, corporate doesn't tell the operating entities, what they have to do. We say to them, what do you think we should do, and how will you accomplish it in your budget. And to that extent, I have great confidence. These are people who have been running these businesses for many years. Nobody, in my opinion, nobody knows their market, their labor market, their customer market better than the people operating the businesses. So and they have done it over and over and over again. So, it's not as though, well, this is something new, can they do it, can they accomplish it, no. They have been doing this for many years. I mean HEICO has a record of growing over 30-some years, the bottom line close to 20% compounded growth. So, because of that, I have great, great confidence in what they are doing. I mean Eric and Victor run those companies, and they go out and they meet with the business unit leaders constantly. They speak to them by phone. Carlos has an extremely detailed financial report weekly. So, we keep track of the receivables of growth, the backlog, cash flows, everything. So, for all those reasons, I really don't worry about the operation of our company. I just worry about, but I don't worry about it because I can't control it. The things like COVID, wars and things like that, which might impact us. But I can't change that. I think we have done as well, Eric, Victor and our team members have done as well as can be done with the company in terms of operations and control, so none of those things worry me. Thank you. You too. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I want to thank everybody who has been listening to this call. I hope we have satisfied you and give you information that you would like, if not, we are available, as you know, give us a call, Eric, Victor, Carlos, myself. And we look forward to speaking to you in the first quarter call, which will be in a few months from now. And we wish all of you a very happy, healthy holiday season, and New Year. And that's the end of this call."

            "content": "Thank you very much. I would like to take a moment to recognize and welcome the Wencor team members to the HEICO family. The Wencor team is a perfect and highly complementary fit with the HEICO culture and I am extremely optimistic about the future of Wencor's contributions to the Flight Support Group's future. I must say that over the last number of months, I have gotten the chance to visit most of the Wencor facilities. And I've been incredibly impressed with the caliber of team members that Wencor has. We had very high expectations for them prior to closing the acquisition, but they continue to amaze everyone and really perform outstandingly well. It really is a privilege and an honor to have gotten to know these people. And also I'd like to thank the HEICO team members for being so welcoming to their new Wencor brothers and sisters and bringing them into the board, because as a team, we can accomplish so much more than we can individually. The HEICO team members have been phenomenally excited about the Wencor acquisitions. We have done about 100 acquisitions, but I can say that this one really has generated incredible enthusiasm and excitement. And I am just absolutely honored to work with both the HEICO and the Wencor team members. We have got a phenomenal group. And I think the results really speak for themselves with a lot more to come. So, again, thank you very much to all of our HEICO Flight Support team members for an incredible performance in the fourth quarter and full 2023. On to the results. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 74% to a record $601.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $346 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The net sales increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 reflects $185.7 million from Wencor and strong organic growth of 20%. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 47% to a record $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823, up from $77.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. Wencor's operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $29.3 million. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by $12.7 million of Wencor acquisition costs and $11.8 million of Wencor's intangible asset amortization expense and higher performance-based compensation expense. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Fight Support Group's operating margin was 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 as compared to 22.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822. The operating margin decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 principally reflects the previously mentioned Wencor acquisition cost and intangible asset amortization expense. Excluding the Wencor acquisition cost and intangible asset amortization expense, the Flight Support Group's operating income increased 79% to $139.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823 and the operating margin was 23.1%. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Hi, good morning, Rob, This is Eric. So I'll start out answering that question, and then Carlos will fill in with some of the details. Wencor has performed exceptionally well as have, frankly, all of the HEICO Flight Support businesses. They are ahead of plan. They are doing very well, working incredibly hard and very similar in culture to the HEICO Group in terms of being conservative in what they predict and frankly, outperforming. I am not sure that the numbers that you state are let's see what Carlos has to say about it. My sense is the Wencor is growing at a similar rate to the HEICO Flight Support aftermarket businesses, but I'll let Carlos fill in on that. Yes, I would say that we have started the effort and its borne fruit. There are a number of projects that the companies are cooperating on. The HEICO style is very much to let our new acquisitions to continue to run as they have. So we can really make sure that we fully understand. I can tell you that a lot of the businesses are cooperating, figuring out product rationalization, how to maximize sales opportunities. There are number of projects that are moving forward. But I would say that, that's something that we are going to be getting into more heavily in 2024. Thank you, Rob. Good morning. I am sorry. And Pete, this is Eric to add, you had asked about pricing. Yes, there is no question that we've got pricing upside potential. However, it's really been our philosophy to pass along our cost increases. And so that's what we've been focused on doing to be able to maintain our margins and to continue to provide a lot of opportunities for our customers. So I think that there is a very large potential there. One of the things is as \u2013 if someone's not buying a part and the OEM has raised the price on the part, then as new customers come in and start buying that part, they pay higher prices. So in a sense, we do get some pricing that way, but we are being very good to our existing customers, and we're looking very much at our cost increases and cost increases have been significant in a number of areas. I don't need to tell you about labor and material. And we have been successful in passing along those cost increases because it's something that we've got to do in order to maintain our margins. As far as the overall operating margin before intangible amortization, I think that we will continue to perform as we have in the past that I'm quite pleased with our performance in the past. And we've got a lot of very, very good things in the hopper, a lot of projects where HEICO and Wencor can work together on a number of things. So I'm very optimistic about the future. Good morning. Well, so when we look at this past year for the Flight Support Group, in \u201823, our operating margin even after the one-time expenses was about roughly 22%. So we are going to have some additional headwinds as a result of the intangible amortization. But I think that when you add back the intangible amortization, you get into around the 23% area within the Flight Support Group. So I do think that we yes, when you add back the intangible amortization and M&A expense, you get back to the 23%. So I do think that there is additional opportunity for us. But again, as I said, we want to be very protective and make sure we take care of our existing customers who have been buying the existing parts. But there is no question that there is a pricing opportunity. I mean if somebody has not purchased a part from us, our list price would escalate and they would not be able to pay the same price for that part as somebody who had been buying it for a long time. So yes, I think that we do have pricing opportunity on the upside. I want to be careful not to get too far over my skis here because again, we are very customer-friendly, but I do think there is pricing opportunity. Yes. I think they remain fairly similar. One of the things that happened for us during the COVID crisis is we got rid of a lot of old aircraft at one-time. So instead of having those headwinds, those headwinds as those older aircraft would have been retired over time, we got rid of them all. So if you look at our sales today, there is been a significant upgrade in the improvement in our fleet age and distribution. So I think that the aircraft that we're servicing today are going to be out there for a long time. They continue to age 1-year per year, and their price points are very positive for HEICO. So I think that we're going to have the wind to our backs for many years. Thank you. Good morning, Ken. Yes. We, both HEICO and Wencor performed very well in terms of new PMA generation. We're continuing to invest, continuing to find new opportunities. So I mean without doubt, this is going to be a record year in terms of PMA generation and the number of parts that we can come out with. I can tell you that I've met with a number of customers since Wencor has closed, and they are really excited and enthusiastic unlike I've ever seen, concerning our product line. They want us to do more Again, there is going to be plenty of business for the OEMs. There is more than enough business to go around. But they clearly have seen after going through a supply chain constraint like we've seen over the last couple of years, not only does HEICO bring cost savings, but we also bring availability. And that is a very, very key part of our value proposition. So that is driving them to want to continue to develop more parts with us. And why I'm so bullish on it. I mean, obviously, we're not going to HEICO-Wencor won't develop the same parts and we can have each of the business units focused in areas where they have a competitive advantage, and that is our plan to be able to broaden the amount of product that we can bring to our customers. Good morning, Scott. I'm sorry, can you just \u2013 the growth of which product line? Got it. Yes. I think what you're speaking about is the Missile Defense products that we're doing. And there is a lot of, there is been a tremendous amount of growth as you can imagine in that area. Everybody has been significantly under-invested in it. And for that reason, we're very optimistic on it. Within our Specialty Products business, we are adding capabilities and space and people to a number of those businesses. So there is a fair amount of, I would say, one-time costs that we're anticipating in 2024, but we're going to be able to cover it within our normal margins. But the business is very strong. And I think that we've really carved out a niche for ourselves in many areas in the defense products. Sure, Scott. I'd be happy to. So in order to get PMA, it's got, the part has got to be the same in terms of form, fit and function. So therefore, yes, the way that we are able to differentiate ourselves with respect to quality, is we typically have tighter tolerances so we produce more consistent parts. And we also have an extremely robust quality inspection program. So when parts come in from vendors, whether they are HEICO vendors or outside vendors, there is a very robust material analysis, whether the part's metal or not metal to confirm grain size, microstructure, hardness, coatings, all of those various constituents to ensure that the part that we ship out is exactly what was designed. Likewise, we have a very robust inspection process to review the dimensions. So I would say that with regard to basically shipping the part according to the design intent, HEICO scores incredibly high in that area. So the parts are more consistent. Airlines are able to basically use them and install them right away and the fallout or rejection rate with HEICO parts, we believe, is significantly lower than with other companies' parts. So they are improved in that regard. We do offer some parts that are improvements where material or dimensions can be changed. But that is a smaller part of our business, but that's also an area of opportunity for us. Hi, good morning, Sheila. Great question. With regard to price action, I don't have that information in front of me. And due to HEICO's decentralized nature, it would be very difficult to pull all of that together. But I would say that in general, we have not, as I said before, we have not pushed price beyond our cost increases. So therefore, customers who have been purchasing the parts for a long time have been treated very well and it's our plan to continue doing that. But of course new people buy the parts, and they haven't purchased the parts in the past, they pay the newer price, and that would reflect increased prices as our labor and material costs have gone up. So, and then with regard to the GTF, I assume that will keep the existing fleet in great demand for a long time. It's going to take a while to work through the GTF problems. And I have no question that they'll ultimately get through them. But in the meantime, that should be really a very strong indicator, I would say, for the aftermarket. And fortunately, these aircraft are able to pick up the slack. So I think that, that's working out quite nicely. Originally, we always said that whenever you got a recovery, there is always a little bit of an overshoot. Well, it looks like perhaps as a result of the GTF issue that overshoot may either be delayed or won't happen, because there is just increased demand. Our backlogs are tremendous. Our suppliers are challenged to keep up I think we're doing better than most in that regard, but there is tremendous, there continues to be tremendous demand for our products and services. Thank you. So Michael, this is Eric. Let me see if I can help you out with that a little bit. If you take the Wencor operating income for the quarter, of $29.3 million and then you add back the $11.8 million of intangible amortization, then you get to a number of about $41 million for the quarter. So when you divide that $41 million by the $186 million approximately of Wencor sales get to about 22% margin adding back the intangible amortization. So if we're saying that HEICO is, Flight Support Group is going to be in the 23% area for this coming year. Wencor based on the fourth quarter was just a tick below that. To just, but I would say it's very similar, very similar to HEICO. Thank you. Good morning, Gautam. No, I would say there really hasn't been thus far. I think that, that is an opportunity for us to mine, as we go forward. And I think that, that will be very much an opportunity. Again, Wencor has operated basically as a stand-alone business. Yes, we're coordinating some activities, but it continues to operate with its own leadership and its own P&L. And, but I think there will be opportunities, such as the ones you're alluding to. Yes, it's a great question. And they are, I mean, pretty much everybody uses PMAs, but there has been an increase in using parts that using HEICO parts that they haven't purchased in the past. And what is it the old saying Necessity is the motherhood of invention. And sometimes people can't get apart from the OEM, then they'll go ahead and then they'll buy it from HEICO. And we certainly have seen that happen. And as a matter of fact, it's particularly gratifying when you see OEMs do that. So, and that's been, I'm not going to get into specifics, obviously, but it's very nice when we see OEMs purchasing the HEICO and the Wencor alternative parts in order to meet their demand because we know the quality is outstanding. Yes. I think HEICO has been running in that 300 to 500 area, roughly 400 parts a year, and Wencor has been running in about 150 area, so I would anticipate those numbers continuing that way. Thank you. Wish you happy holidays. Yes. This is Eric. I would be happy Louie, to answer that. As I mentioned, the HEICO philosophy when we acquire a business is just to leave it alone and observe what's going on. We have got our initial view, and then we want to make sure we confirm that first before making substantial changes. So yes, the ownership period of Wencor has gone extremely well. And we are working on a number of projects in terms of product rationalization, sharing resources between the businesses, sending business to HEICO-Wencor, which used to go outside. So, all of that is going well. Specifically with regard to the e-commerce platform, we think that that's going to be an opportunity for 2024. It's something that we are looking at right now. We continue to believe very much that's going to be a huge asset. They are studying the best way to go ahead and do that. But no, we have not done it to-date, not because we don't want to do it, but because frankly, both businesses are running at such a high percentage of utilization that we don't have people to be able to focus on all of the projects that we are just sort of taking them as we can handle them. But we believe that that's going to be a tremendous benefit for us in 2024. Well, I think the revenue synergies are going to start accruing quickly. And then as far as some of the cost synergies, the business units are taking it upon themselves to work together and to find areas where they can rationalize product lines. If one business does more of a particular product than another, they are looking at swapping. So this way, we can maintain the workforces. We have got tremendous volumes and all the businesses are running at a high utilization factor. So, but if we can redirect people to more efficient activities, we want to do that. So, we are taking advantage of the revenue synergies and of some of the cost synergies, but I would say that that's going to be something that benefits us in both \u201824 and \u201825. Thank you. Yes. We are seeing strength, frankly, across the board. So, we dive down into the part number level. So, it's just very, very broad-based strength straight across the board. So, I wouldn't want to call out one area or another. It's really just very strong across the board. I can't. I don't have that actually in front of me right now. But it would fall broadly into parts and into MRO in terms of the disaggregation of revenue. But I don't have that information in front of me at the moment. But I would say that we are doing very well in both of those areas. Yes. Colin, so I will start out. What I was referring to in response to the prior question, concerning the GTF was that as a result of the GTF-powered aircraft being taken out of service in order to have their engines overhauled, that would create additional demand for legacy aircraft. So, I don't want to call that out as anything more than a tailwind. But clearly, it's going to be good for the use of the utilization of non-GTF powered aircraft. With regard to HEICO's involvement in the GTF campaign, I would say that it is not material. We are not supplying PMAs on the GTF in any material quantity. And frankly, the service that's being done now is being paid by the manufacturer. So, that would not be a revenue opportunity for us. If we have got businesses that are supplying parts into the OEM, then there could be a little bit of increased demand for that. But no, I would not call it out as a special one-time item."

I now turn the call over to Lawrence Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLarry Mendelson: Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO third quarter fiscal '23 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's dedicated and talented team members who are responsible for another strong quarter of excellent results. They continue to produce the highest quality products and services for our customers, while maintaining our unique entrepreneurial corporate culture that has delivered excellent returns to shareholders. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the approximate 1,000 HEICO-Wencor Group team members who recently joined the HEICO family. We look forward to our collective journey of exceeding customer expectations and winning in the marketplace. I, personally, have never been more optimistic about the future for HEICO. I'd like to now summarize the highlights of our third quarter fiscal record results. Consolidated third quarter fiscal '23 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued strong demand for our commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '23 improved by 16% and 27%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. These results mainly reflect a 12% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the impact from acquisitions. I'd like to note an important item. HEICO incurred acquisition costs from the Wencor acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal '23. And this decreased our net income by approximately $3.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The way management looks at our operations, we were able to report $0.74 a share earnings in the third quarter, after deducting this unusual $0.03 per share. So management considers our earnings in the third quarter as actually $0.77. Recognizing this, our operating margins, especially before Wencor related non-recurring deal expenses, that's what I was talking about, $3.5 million or $0.03, remained strong and are consistent with the expectations we previously communicated in investor calls and events. These margins are very healthy margins even though our product mix this year has meant lower overall margins than in prior years. Consolidated net income attributable to HEICO increased 24% and to $102 million or $0.74 per diluted share, of course, again, after deducting $0.03 of those special Wencor expenses in the third quarter of fiscal '23, and that was up from $82.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '22. In connection with the Wencor acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.75x as of July 31, '23, and that compared to 0.25x as of October 31, '22. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased in the first nine months of fiscal '23, and due to our successful offering of $600 million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes due August 1, '28 and $600 million of 5.35% senior unsecured notes due August 1, '33. We used the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund a portion of the Wencor acquisition purchase price. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong at $145.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, and that compared to $149.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. Cash flow provided by operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal '23, reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support increased consolidated backlog. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '23. In June, we were honored to announce that I will receive the prestigious 44th Annual Howard Hughes Memorial Award from the Aero Club of Southern California on Wednesday, September 6. The Howard Hughes Memorial Award honors exceptional leaders who have advanced field of aviation or aerospace technology. Upon receipt of the award, I will join 43 aviation and aerospace pioneers, including last year's honoree, Harrison Ford, as well as prior honorees, general Chuck Yeager, Bob Hoover, Neil Neil, general Jimmy Doolittle, Elon Musk, Jim Love, Maryland, Houston and captain Sully Sullenberger and many others. I'm profoundly honored to receive such a prestigious award from such a prestigious organization, though I believe it really belongs to all of HEICO's team members because it results from all of their remarkable work and success over several decades. The Aero Club of Southern California is recognized as one of the leading aviation and aerospace organizations in the world. And the idea that they would bestow this award upon me leaves me deeply humbled and very grateful. Last week, we announced that our 3D PLUS and Exxelia subsidiaries supplied mission-critical electronic components on India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which successfully executed a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole. We offer our congratulations to the Indian Space Research Organization, and we are honored to be a trusted supplier on this remarkable and historic mission. The level of sophisticated engineering, quality and precision demonstrated by our subsidiaries on this project was outstanding and commendable. I'd like to now discuss our recent acquisition activity. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Wencor for $1.9 billion in cash and approximately 1.1 million shares of HEICO Class A common stock with an assigned value of $150 million in the merger agreement or a total of $2.05 billion in the aggregate. The transaction was HEICO's largest ever in terms of purchase price as well as revenue and income acquired. We believe Wencor is a perfect and highly complementary fit with HEICO. And we expect the combination will be transformative, providing a unique and growing portfolio of proprietary cost saving solutions for our airline and OEM customers. We continue to anticipate this highly synergistic acquisition to be accretive to our earnings within the year following closing. In addition, HEICO anticipates that it will continue to achieve its often articulated growth objective in the years subsequent to the closing. Immediately following the closing, we forecast pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio will be approximately 3:1, and will return to historically low levels within roughly one year to 18 months after acquisition, excluding the impact of future acquisition or possible capital deployment activities. At this time, I would like to now introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the third quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. First of all, I would like to welcome our new 1,000 Wencor team members into the new HEICO and Wencor family. This combination has been something that we've dreamed of doing for literally the past 20 years. And we could not be more excited and more overjoyed that this finally has come to fruition. Over the last number of weeks, I've been visiting Wencor facilities around the United States and have a very busy schedule plan for the next couple of months as I go out and meet all of the Wencor team members. I've been particularly impressed with the quality and the outstanding character and ability and DNA of the Wencor team members. You can never know what is going to happen down the road. And you never know exactly what it's like to work with people who have been in the same space, but you haven't gotten to know very well over many years. And I can tell you that our hopes and dreams have been completely fulfilled. As I've gotten to know the Wencor team members and their DNA, it is remarkably similar to HEICO's style and DNA. And it is something that I think is going to yield tremendous results for many, many years to come. So again, welcome to all of our new team members from Wencor. Going into the results. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 23% to a record $405 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $330.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 reflects robust 19% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 acquisition. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from continued global commercial air travel growth as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. The Flight Support Group has now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of growth in net sales, and these numbers don't yet include the positive impact we expect from the Wencor acquisition, which will further transform our business as the world's leading independent aftermarket supplier. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 26% to $89.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $70.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in the previously mentioned acquisition costs related to the Wencor acquisition. The improved gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects higher net sales and a favorable product mix across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.0% in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The operating margin increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, partially offset by the previously mentioned acquisition costs, which reduced our operating margin by approximately 81 basis points. Our second quarter of fiscal '23 margin of 25.5% included a onetime benefit of 2.3%, yielding a 23.2% net operating margin on a continuing basis. Our third quarter of fiscal '23 margin was 22.8% before the unique costs related to the Wencor acquisition. We're very proud of these excellent operating margins, which have increased approximately 300 basis points from our then record 2019, and increased 400 basis points from our then record 2018. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 33% to a record $325.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $244.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions as well as increased commercial aviation and other electronics products net sales, partially offset by lower year-over-year defense products net sales. We were pleased to see 10% sequential growth over the second quarter of fiscal '23 in defense product net sales, and we're equally pleased that quarterly organic commercial aerospace and other electronic products, net sales growth contributed 2% overall organic net sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 9% to $74.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $68 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin and higher costs from our January '23 acquisition. The lower gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects decreased defense products net sales, partially offset by increased commercial aviation and other electronics products net sales. In line with our expectations, the Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was 22.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '23 as compared to 27.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '22. This margin is after roughly 500 basis points of amortization. So, the EBITA margin from what our businesses sell was really close to around 28%, which I and we consider to be excellent and is consistent with the margin range that I've talked about on other earnings calls and in other venues that we should expect for this business before taking account into future acquisitions. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLarry Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. As for the outlook of HEICO in our opinion, as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '23, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the FSG and ETG, divisions, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures may lead to higher material and labor costs. In addition, we've begun sharing the best practices and getting to know the Wencor businesses, which share a very similar entrepreneurial culture and customer focus as HEICO's businesses. We do believe the Wencor acquisition provides HEICO with additional scale to continue broadening our aerospace products and services, while maintaining our special culture of treating customers with respect and integrity. Our operating margins especially before non-recurring acquisition expenses remain very healthy and reflect our strong business operations. We believe our ongoing conservative policies and strong cash flows enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and take advantage of strategic acquisition opportunities, which collectively position HEICO for future market gains. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. I humbly welcome all of the Wencor team members to our family and look forward to winning new business together as one team. Thanks to all the HEICO team members for everything you do today to make HEICO an excellent company. I would now like to open the floor for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll start with our first question from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Larry, Eric, Victor and Carlos, congratulations on the Wencor deal. Really great stuff. Eric, I just wanted to start there. Just when you closed the Exxelia deal, there was -- that obviously put some pressure on the reported operating margins of the ETG Group. And I just -- maybe if you could just level set us how we're thinking about the impact will be because of, one, of course, probably a little bit of a lower margin profile. How you think about what that kind of the impact will be? And then, what are some of the opportunities to think about just from a synergy perspective?\nLarry Mendelson: Let me just kind of clarify one thing. The margins on Wencor and the margins on Exxelia are really different. And so Eric and Victor can speak to that. The margins on Wencor are pretty much in line with the margins of our Flight Support Group. But the margins on Exxelia are lower. But Eric and Victor can speak more detail to that.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So we're -- this is Eric. We're obviously very excited about the Wencor acquisition for some of the reasons that I mentioned earlier on the call. We think that it's a tremendous broadening of our product line. It's sort of amazing that you could have two companies sort of focused in different spaces. And now with the opportunity to bring them together, we're able to offer significantly more to our customers. And I can tell you that major customers have been extremely supportive of this business combination and have really been looking forward to the benefits that it's going to bring. And I think that's one of the reasons why we were able to secure antitrust approval so quickly, and because, frankly, our customers are really pushing us and very excited about this. So with regard to the margins, I would say that the Wencor EBITA margins are very similar to the flight support margins. Carlos can get into some of the specifics, but are basically within the same area. Obviously, there's going to be some intangible amortization as a result of those -- as a result of the acquisition. But as far as the EBITA earnings of the business, it's going to be, in general, in the same area as the HEICO businesses. And we do anticipate tremendous synergies going forward. Right now, we're all in a learning phase. We want to be very careful and make sure that we harness all of the benefits that this combination brings. Unlike many companies, we don't sort of set out with an operating margin target. We just simply want each of the businesses to perform to the best of its ability and to generate the margins that are correct for its long-term success. So if look at the Flight Support group, I'm really happy that our margins, people back in 2018 thought we were sort of at top margins, and now we're up 400 basis points from there. In 2019, they thought we were at top margins we're up 300 basis points. We did not set a target a specific target of a number where we want it to be. Instead, we just make the decisions that make sense, breach operating businesses and the margins end up where they are. So, I'm very encouraged that as a result of adding the Wencor product line that we're going to continue on this journey to improve margins. But in general, there -- the EBITA margins are in the same ZIP code as the flight support margins. Does that sort of answer your question?\nPeter Arment: Yes. Yes, very helpful. Maybe Carlos could just clarify maybe on the purchase accounting adjustments.\nCarlos Macau: So we closed on one core August 4. So it's not in our third quarter numbers, although we did have acquisition expenses incurred through the end of 7/31 in there. We paid a little over $2 billion for Wencor. I would expect the expenses related to the deal will be south of 1% of the purchase price. We don't have all of those bills in yet, if you would, but there will be some deal costs that flow in Q4 that are not capitalized and will be expensed. So more to come on that as we get those bills. The purchase accounting side of it, I don't expect huge inventory write-ups like we normally have with some deals. Given the nature of their products, they have a lot of -- they have repair, they have parts and they have distribution. And so some of those businesses, particularly in the parts and distribution, they don't lend themselves to inventory write-ups that we experienced in other businesses. So we'll see how that plays out. And there'll be more to come on that, Peter, in the fourth quarter.\nPeter Arment: Okay. That's helpful. And just, Victor, just to clarify, could you just quantify, if you can, the impact of the supply chain on ETG in the third quarter?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, Peter, this is Victor. Good question. It's now running below or it ran below rather $20 million, probably a few million dollars below $20 million, somewhere in that range. And so definitely moving in the right direction, big improvement there, and from talking with our companies and surveying them, the vast majority feel, it's moving in the right direction or at least stabilized. So we're pretty happy with that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPeter Skibitski: Maybe I want to start with Eric. Eric, just kind of broadly, we're kind of at the end of the summer travel season here for the most part, right? I was just wondering, as you look at the potential for kind of the reality maybe of economic weakness in Europe and China, we'll see how long that lasts or not. But you talked to so many of the airlines. I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on -- do you think these guys are going to get more cautious on their aftermarket spend kind of in the forward 12 months in this environment? And maybe you can give us a sense of with Wencor, is the opportunity for share gain maybe more than enough to offset any potential greater cost and by the airlines and their spend?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So Pete, let me start out by saying the market is incredibly strong. And we -- at the moment, we don't see any slowdown in sight. We -- having said that, we also understand that all recoveries are -- tend to end with a little bit of an overshoot and then things trend down just a little bit and then they resume their upward climb. I think one of the interesting things that may be going on now is that there's a lot of older equipment out there that really needs a lot of maintenance. And there has been a shortage of parts. The airlines still don't have as much as many parts as they need. And so we really see a lot of support in the market. So I don't see a slowdown in the cards right now. As far as China and Asia goes, those were the last to recover. So I don't think that we've even seen the full recovery there yet. So I think things are very strong in general. I mean, we're in this for the long haul. And whenever a little slowdown comes, to your point, I think that there's going to be a lot of synergy opportunities between HEICO and Wencor and being able to broaden our product lines. And I think we will continue to gain share and we'll move through that period. very well. So, I'm not concerned about it at all.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. Just last one for me is just I know you guys are not aggressive with pricing. But just should we expect the continued approach at FSG just to be -- make sure you kind of -- you claw back inflation, so you get some modest net pricing power post inflation. Is that kind of the general way to think about things going forward?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I think that's fair. I mean, our business is always want to gain market share. We always believe in an expansionary opportunity. We don't work out of scarcity and we think that tomorrow always has greater opportunity than today. Having said that, we've got to make sure that we recapture our costs, and we maintain and grow our margins a bit. So I think due to the efficiency that we've got in the businesses, the operating leverage, I would anticipate that we're going to continue to move in a positive direction while continuing to generate huge value for our customers. I mean, we save our customers a lot of money. We treat them very, very well. They know that. And I think that's why, frankly, they were so supportive of the Wencor combination these two companies coming together is something which is really going to be very helpful to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawrence Scott: Great. And I echo my congrats on a good quarter and obviously, the largest acquisition in your history. Just sticking with the Wencor theme for a couple of questions. Eric, I know you don't give specific -- but it feels like on synergies and accretion immediately were targets, but it feels like this acquisition, more than many, it's larger, obviously, but it just feels like one plus one equals three in many places more than your usual acquisition. Just kind of trying to want to talk through some of the complementary things and where you see some of the combination really benefiting HEICO the most.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks. I agree with you. I think that this one is a uniquely synergistic acquisition. It's something that we had to do, makes us a stronger competitor, much more efficient, brings more products to our customers. The other thing, Larry, that it does is as we share best practices, and we've already started doing this. Each company sort of focused in different areas. And I think there's a tremendous amount that we can learn by sharing those best practices and going to what I call the highest common denominator. If we are so fortunate as to have operating efficiencies, that would really be great news, one, because our costs would go down. But two, the combined HEICO and Wencor have over 100 unfilled job openings. And we've learned that our best and most productive team members typically come from inside, from inside of the businesses, they understand the culture. And we think that there's going to be great opportunities for the HEICO and the Wencor team members to take on expanded roles going forward. So, I think when you put all of that together, hopefully, the need -- we won't have to go out and hire as many people from the outside. And instead, we can promote from within. I think we're really in a very unique opportunity here. I want to be careful and not get too far over our skis before having the opportunity to get into the details because it's all detail driven. We don't come out with a model and say, okay, we expect you from the corporate office to cut cost by x and raise price by y, and do that. Some companies do that. It's extremely effective for them. What we have found in our very competitive businesses is the best thing is just to make the right long-term operating decisions. And if you do that, you plant the seeds and you reap the benefits for years to come. And so you've been around HEICO for a long time. And I don't think any of us back in 2018, 2019 thought that we would be increasing our operating margins by 300 basis points from '19, 400 basis points from '18 just through our standard operating procedure. So, I think that we've got that opportunity. Wencor is extraordinarily well run. They've got a DNA so similar to HEICO. They're very focused on the customer, very focused on efficiency getting it done, jumping through hoops for the customers. So there couldn't be a better marriage. So I couldn't be more optimistic. Everything that we had hoped for in the acquisition is proving true. So, we're -- I think we're well on our way.\nLawrence Scott: Great. I appreciate all that color. And then maybe switching gears real fast. Victor, just you guys mentioned, obviously, defense has been a little bit of a laggard year-to-date more on the delivery side than on the bookings. Could you maybe speak to some of your other markets as well as defense bookings on a go-forward basis, kind of where we stand there? And just on the margin -- segment margin. I know obviously, Exxelia is impacted margins somewhat. But as defense comes back, could we expect maybe a little bit of a rebound off of kind of these 22%, 23% numbers that we've seen in the last two quarters?\nVictor Mendelson: So, yes, a couple of things, I mean the defense businesses that we're seeing orders increase in those particular businesses tend to be our higher-margin businesses. So what I would expect that this kind of 28% EBITA margin, probably at some point over the next six months starts to tick higher, though I want to see that and we're doing budgets now and we're going through our budget cycle. So I want to really see that for sure. But that's kind of how it feels now. Commercial Aviation, I would expect to remain strong. A variety of space businesses for us, I think will remain strong from what I see orders being healthy. I think the other electronics, the other high-end electronics, as I said, I think, in the last two calls, those, I would expect to be softer and they're more tied to, let's say, the general economy and their own different cycles than the other businesses. And I think that will take a little bit of time to cycle through more than six months.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Congrats on the -- getting the deal done. Good results, as always. Maybe Eric or Carlos, you referenced kind of the historical FSG margins here a couple of times and how you've exceeded kind of those, if we were to say, they'd be assumed prior peaks, I guess you're not going to give specifics, but with Wencor, with the potential synergies? And I guess as you look forward, do you think you've got room to push these FSG margins even higher once you kind of fully extract all those synergies with Wencor and maybe penetrate even further on both revenue and cost synergies?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Michael, and thank you for your comments. This is Eric. First of all, the short answer is yes. I want to be careful as to not get out and set expectations very high because we are in right now the process of HEICO understanding how the Wencor businesses operate, Wencor understanding how the HEICO businesses operate. So it's very, very important. We did not set out -- when we increased margins over the last five years by 400 basis points, we didn't do that by, if you will, setting a goal and then going towards that goal. Instead, what we did was made sure that we had really capable, hungry, talented, hard-working, honest people running each of their businesses and doing the best that they could possibly do. And that's exactly how Wencor operates. That's how HEICO continues to operate. So I personally am hopeful that we continue to increase these margins as time goes on. But I want to be careful as to not get ahead of ourselves and start predicting what those numbers are going to be. I'd rather -- and it's not a matter of under promising and over delivering. It's a matter of truly not knowing. We just make the right decisions and we do the right things. And that lays the foundation for a terrific groundswell of opportunity. So, I think it's important to go ahead and do that and continue doing that. But yes, I think the margins are going to increase. Now we do have, of course, the amortization that's coming from the Wencor acquisition, and Carlos can get into that. It's really important that everybody model that. But of course, that's a non-cash charge. It has nothing to do with the operating income of the business. I mean that's non-sensical charge, which actually we get a tax benefit from. So -- but yes, I think our margins are going to continue to do well. Carlos, I don't know if you want to get into some of the specifics there.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I would just say, Michael, as I've said over the past several quarters, the FSG continues to grow at a fast pace. All verticals within the Flight Support Group are growing at a fast pace. And we still haven't settled into what I'll call our footprint where the mix sort of normalizes. So until that happens, we're going to have movement in the margin, plus and minus. This quarter, it was 22%. I think I've been pretty clear that I think that on a long-term basis, we might settle in around that point and then grow gradually from there. I don't know if we're at that point yet because I do think there's some more growth to come that may be -- that may have the verticals growing at different rates that messes with mix a little bit. But I do think if you look at the last decade, the FSG, the one thing that's been pretty consistent is the ECA margin gains is just about every year. And it's not large gains. It's just steps, right? Leveraging our fixed costs, it's new products and things like that. I expect that pattern to continue once we settle into our, what I'll call it, normal footprint or mix for the segment.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. Perfect. And just one more on housekeeping just to kind of maybe level set us for modeling. I mean looking at the fiscal fourth quarter, two months contribution from Wencor. I mean, was this sort of -- if you can maybe give us a sense, has it been sort of just under $200 million quarterly revenue run rate? Or what can we expect from the Wencor contribution in this fourth quarter?\nCarlos Macau: I think that's a good question. What I I'll give you this guidance. We expected when we put -- when we did the deal that Wencor would do, pro forma sales around $724 million in '23, and we still expect that. So I mean, I guess you could divide that number by four and come up with a quarterly run rate. But that's what we continue to expect. And the truth is they've done a little better since we've acquired them. But I think for modeling purposes, if you take what we already published, the $724 million divided by four that will give you a quarterly run rate for now. And once we get through Q4, and we have our sea legs under us on the acquisition, we'll give some better thoughts at that point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Maybe, Eric, if I could start with you with another question on Wencor. Can you talk a little bit about how that business has grown organically over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic? And how should we think about with the Wencor business, the sort of the organic growth profile of that business over the next few years, maybe either relative to FSG at large or relative to some of the specific product lines within your business?\nEric Mendelson: Ken, I'd be happy to answer that. I would say that one quarter's growth rate has been very similar to HEICO's very comparable. They've done a great job in growing the PMA business, the repair, the distribution, the defense. So it's been very, very similar to HEICO. So -- and their operating philosophies, so similar to HEICO. That's why I think that there's going to be immediate opportunities to start working together. As a matter of fact, one of our businesses just send me an e-mail on Friday, he placed a $400,000 order with Wencor on a bunch of stuff. They didn't even know Wencor supplied before we started introducing some of the various folks. So I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity there. And -- but the growth rates, I would say, are really quite similar. Wencor has been extraordinarily aggressive in its markets. And it's sort of interesting that HEICO, Wencor sort of didn't bump up against each other very much. There's been relatively little overlap, and it's been in different areas. So, I think it is sustainable.\nKen Herbert: That's great. And as you look at the Encore business and you look out over the next few years and obviously, the distribution, the repair and the PMA lines within Wencor. Are there any particular parts of the business that you're maybe more bullish about? Or where you see some really unique opportunity to take share? How should we think about the various pieces of Wencor and the outlook over the next couple of years?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think they're very well positioned in each of the businesses. PMA is very strong and in areas complementary to HEICO in a lot of products that HEICO is not in. So, I think that by having a bigger supply basket that we can offer to our customers, we're going to generate a lot of value. Likewise, on the repair side, Wencor operates in a very decentralized autonomous entrepreneurial fashion, and they have focused in areas where HEICO wasn't by and large. So, I think that that's going to be very strong. Distribution has been phenomenal. They've captured a lot of lines, and they have a great relationship with their distribution partners and they've got a very robust pipeline. So, I think that's going to be good. And then in the defense market, they're relatively new to that, and they found some defense areas where we haven't been planning. So it's really adding to the product line. So I don't mean to not answer the question, but I would say I'm very optimistic on all four of Wencor's. And then really, HEICO's vertical, which I'm very also optimistic on, is our specialty products because Wencor doesn't manufacture things themselves, and they buy a lot of stuff. And the HEICO Specialty Products group manufactured, I mean that's our specialty to manufacture these basically, source-approved products. And I think that we're going to be able to make a lot of stuff for Wencor. Not necessarily that they're going to resource existing suppliers. They're very loyal to their existing suppliers. But I think on a go-forward basis, in the time when capacity is very tight, they're already asking our businesses to make product for them. So, I think our Specialty Products business is also going to be a beneficiary. But that's going to be over like a five-year period because it takes a while to get all of that manufacturing product digested. But I think it's going to be all across the Flight Support Group's five sort of operating verticals.\nOperator: I'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So, I wanted to go back to the same line of questioning you've had over the last few questions. Maybe on Wencor, just maybe touch upon the opportunity, Eric, you've been talking about a lot of the revenue synergies and what portion of their business is distribution for their own PMA parts versus third parties? And the same thing for HEICO, and how that kind of results in the delta revenue per employee, which is almost double HEICOs?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So as you're aware, Sheila, so we disaggregate revenue into three areas: parts; repair; and specialty products. So, Wencor's business is going to be included in the parts and the repair section of the flight support numbers. So -- and my guess is that it's probably going to be roughly 1/3 repair, roughly 2/3 parts. And the parts includes both distribution -- maybe a little bit more on the parts side. The parts include distribution as well as PMA. So they're all growing very well that there's tremendous synergy opportunity between these businesses. So I think they're going to continue to do extraordinarily well. And as you know, there's a big interplay between those various areas because the repair businesses, obviously, require parts in order to repair their products and those come in, in the form of distributed product as well as PMA product. So I think it's going to be very strong there. That already gives you an idea, roughly, let's just say 70 -- one quarter is roughly, 70% parts, 30% repair in that general area.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And Eric, another one for you, sorry, I'm just keeping it to you for today. There's this thesis out there that aftermarket is softening and decelerating for whatever reason. How do you guys model the trajectory of FSG in the long being of steer? Is it just that of warranty aircraft? Or is it individual sales? Can you give us your thoughts on how you think the overall aftermarket business is going to grow from here?\nEric Mendelson: Well, for us, the aftermarket business is extremely strong. Back in last December, I thought that even though we weren't seeing any softening, that a softening would be inevitable and would come, and I was wrong. Things remain extremely strong. And I think that is a result of us capturing share, more people wanting to do more things with us. And I think, frankly, the future for us is very good. We don't see a softening as of now. And our backlog is tremendous. Some of our backlogs in some of the businesses are 2x the historical rate. So things are really strong. You've got an older fleet, which requires a lot of very expensive parts. And a lot of these, you can't MEL a lot of these components, and you've got to get them fixed. And I think things are continuing to remain strong. Yes, the day will come when we come off the top of it and the whole industry comes off the top a little bit and does a little bit of a dip. But I think, frankly, the industry is very, very well positioned and is going to go from strength to strength here.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Josh Sullivan with the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nJosh Sullivan: Just the comments around using strong cash flow to invest in R&D. As you integrate Wencor and explore new value parts or PMA opportunities, should we expect a development cycle from the time you increase kind of that investment in PMA development to the time of FA approvals, any R&D cycle to think about as you integrate here?\nEric Mendelson: I don't think so. I think that the cycles are pretty short at both HEICO and Wencor. I think actually, that's probably one of the things that we may be able to help win quarter shorten some of the cycles. But I would say, in general, the cycles are very similar. I don't think there's going to be a major change in new product development spending. We're just going to continue doing the things that we've always done. And I think it's going to be very consistent. But by sort of putting together these baskets of products, it's just becoming a tremendous value to our customers. This is something that they really need -- they've expressed a lot of frustration when they can't get a part or they can't get a component. There have been a lot of shortages, both HEICO and Wencor, notwithstanding our big backlogs I think, have done a really good job with on-time delivery relative to the industry. And that's why I think our customers want to reward us with more business.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Got it. And then just the comments around -- you called out the majority of products driving growth. But curious within FSG, what types of products were in that minority which didn't drive growth or any common themes there?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. There have been a couple of businesses, I would say, more in the specialty products area, where basically commercial OEM products, you're familiar with the -- sort of the vagaries of the commercial build market. Certain things are hot, certain things are not. So I would say there's been a little bit of a slowdown in some of that. I would say that's probably the area that has been if you will the slowest. But the backlogs are very strong. And I can tell you over on the defense side of our Specialty Products business, backlogs are enormous, and we're very optimistic for future sales. So I think we're very, very well positioned. I mean frankly, if we had the capacity right now, we could -- our specialty products in a number of businesses, could ship significantly more than they are. I mean we are just so busy. And yet we continue to add space and add real estate, add machines, add people. But just keeping up with the demand is really difficult. And these tend to be a little bit longer cycle. But I think both Wencor and the HEICO businesses, if they could, they would really load significantly more business into our specialty products, but we just don't have the capacity at the moment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jack Ayers with TD Cohen. Please go ahead.\nJack Ayers: This is Jack on for Gautam today. Eric, just going back to Wencor here. I think you talked about the margin profile, EBITA roughly similar to FSG? And I know, Larry, you kind of mentioned about net leverage at 3x and sort of quickly deleveraging kind of historical levels over time. I kind of just wanted to dig on that a little bit more because it seems pretty robust. And if we're kind of looking at this correctly, I mean it does seem like quite an inflection in cash and EBITDA. So I just kind of wanted to dig on sort of the cash profile of Wencor, maybe working capital dynamics, things like that. Just any color.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think there Wencor's cash profile is very similar to HEICO's. They -- as far as receivables and inventory, they have a very similar policy in terms of cash generation, I think it's going to be very, very similar to HEICO. Of course, we are going to have the -- as I mentioned in an earlier question, we will have the intangible amortization to contend with, but that's a non-cash charge. I mean that doesn't impact our cash. And as I mentioned, we even get a tax benefit for a chunk of it. So it helps cash. But it's, I would say, very, very similar. We've been very fortunate to acquire almost like our brother from another mother. I mean it's -- the businesses are just very, very similar.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Maybe just a follow-up on Jack's question there. When you guys talked about the historical leverage within 12 to 18 months, I guess, what are we looking at? Like are we looking at the 2019 to 2022 where you were sort of 0 to 0.5 turn levered? Are you talking sort of further back where you're one to two turns levered? Just trying to get a sense.\nCarlos Macau: Louis, this is Carlos. When we talk about historical levels, we're talking something below two. That's how we think about it.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. And then maybe, Carlos, just the corporate expense seemed to step up in the quarter. Was there anything else related to the deal or anything else just to be mindful of?\nCarlos Macau: No, there was a lot -- there was some intersegment activity, which was maybe on an apples-to-apples basis might have been $1 million higher. That's not unusual timing. There were some step-ups in some costs, in particular, IT and professional services, travel, things like that. There were some increases there. But I would say that proportionally, with the growth in the business, it didn't necessarily grow an outward pace. You know what I mean, it was pretty much consistent with the growth in the business.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. That's great. And then, I mean, I guess, Larry, maybe one for you, just additional M&A from here. Obviously, you've done your two largest deals back to back now. I guess, how do we think about you absorbing Wencor and sort of moving on with your historical strategy from here?\nLarry Mendelson: Well, I think we might have to take a little bit of a rest. We want to get, as we mentioned, get that debt down below three, and into the area of 2x EBITDA. However, I think there might be some bolt-on acquisitions. We're looking at a number of transactions we don't drop our M&A strategy just because of the two large acquisitions. And we are looking at them. And I think we will find ways to finance them at the same time, keeping the desire to get below 2x EBITDA. So, I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time. I think we can do it and we'll work that out. We'll work the financial arrangements out. As we are now were rated as a credit investment credit rating on our bonds. We want to keep that. We're very proud of that. In addition, it saves us interest cost. And so we will, again, push to get it down below 2x and or 2x. Prior to this Wencor, we have never been even at 2x EBITDA. So, I'll remind you of that. And we don't like leverage, strong leverage, so we're going to work towards that. But we -- I think we still will be able to make acquisitions and do both.\nLouis Raffetto: Great. Victor, just a quick one for you. I think, obviously, the defense growth was nice sequentially up 10%. I think you said it was still down maybe year-over-year. Do you have that number? I know last quarter, you said it was down 14%, but just curious this quarter.\nCarlos Macau: Louis, this is Carlos. I actually have that number handy. Organically, defense was down in the high single digits, which that coming off the last, gosh, four, five, six quarters, that's heading in the right direction. That's why it was important to us when we saw that sequential growth in defense to highlight that because we've been waiting for that. That's something we've known was going to come, we just didn't know exactly when. So, that's -- one quarter doesn't make a trend, but we're optimistic, not only given that swing, but also some of the forecasts from our subs tend to support, the fact that we may be seeing a turn here in our defense electronics business.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time.\nLarry Mendelson: Okay. This is Larry Mendelson, and we have no more questions. If any of you do have questions, you know that Eric, Victor, Carlos and I are available, give us a call, we'll try to help you out. And we thank you for participating in this call, and we look forward to speaking to you in the fourth quarter earnings call, which will be sometime towards the middle or end of December. So, thank you all and this is the end of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "So we closed on one core August 4. So it's not in our third quarter numbers, although we did have acquisition expenses incurred through the end of 7/31 in there. We paid a little over $2 billion for Wencor. I would expect the expenses related to the deal will be south of 1% of the purchase price. We don't have all of those bills in yet, if you would, but there will be some deal costs that flow in Q4 that are not capitalized and will be expensed. So more to come on that as we get those bills. The purchase accounting side of it, I don't expect huge inventory write-ups like we normally have with some deals. Given the nature of their products, they have a lot of -- they have repair, they have parts and they have distribution. And so some of those businesses, particularly in the parts and distribution, they don't lend themselves to inventory write-ups that we experienced in other businesses. So we'll see how that plays out. And there'll be more to come on that, Peter, in the fourth quarter. Yes. I would just say, Michael, as I've said over the past several quarters, the FSG continues to grow at a fast pace. All verticals within the Flight Support Group are growing at a fast pace. And we still haven't settled into what I'll call our footprint where the mix sort of normalizes. So until that happens, we're going to have movement in the margin, plus and minus. This quarter, it was 22%. I think I've been pretty clear that I think that on a long-term basis, we might settle in around that point and then grow gradually from there. I don't know if we're at that point yet because I do think there's some more growth to come that may be -- that may have the verticals growing at different rates that messes with mix a little bit. But I do think if you look at the last decade, the FSG, the one thing that's been pretty consistent is the ECA margin gains is just about every year. And it's not large gains. It's just steps, right? Leveraging our fixed costs, it's new products and things like that. I expect that pattern to continue once we settle into our, what I'll call it, normal footprint or mix for the segment. I think that's a good question. What I I'll give you this guidance. We expected when we put -- when we did the deal that Wencor would do, pro forma sales around $724 million in '23, and we still expect that. So I mean, I guess you could divide that number by four and come up with a quarterly run rate. But that's what we continue to expect. And the truth is they've done a little better since we've acquired them. But I think for modeling purposes, if you take what we already published, the $724 million divided by four that will give you a quarterly run rate for now. And once we get through Q4, and we have our sea legs under us on the acquisition, we'll give some better thoughts at that point. Louis, this is Carlos. When we talk about historical levels, we're talking something below two. That's how we think about it. No, there was a lot -- there was some intersegment activity, which was maybe on an apples-to-apples basis might have been $1 million higher. That's not unusual timing. There were some step-ups in some costs, in particular, IT and professional services, travel, things like that. There were some increases there. But I would say that proportionally, with the growth in the business, it didn't necessarily grow an outward pace. You know what I mean, it was pretty much consistent with the growth in the business.

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 33% to a record $325.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $244.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions as well as increased commercial aviation and other electronics products net sales, partially offset by lower year-over-year defense products net sales. We were pleased to see 10% sequential growth over the second quarter of fiscal '23 in defense product net sales, and we're equally pleased that quarterly organic commercial aerospace and other electronic products, net sales growth contributed 2% overall organic net sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 9% to $74.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $68 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin and higher costs from our January '23 acquisition. The lower gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects decreased defense products net sales, partially offset by increased commercial aviation and other electronics products net sales. In line with our expectations, the Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was 22.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '23 as compared to 27.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '22. This margin is after roughly 500 basis points of amortization. So, the EBITA margin from what our businesses sell was really close to around 28%, which I and we consider to be excellent and is consistent with the margin range that I've talked about on other earnings calls and in other venues that we should expect for this business before taking account into future acquisitions. The lower operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes, Peter, this is Victor. Good question. It's now running below or it ran below rather $20 million, probably a few million dollars below $20 million, somewhere in that range. And so definitely moving in the right direction, big improvement there, and from talking with our companies and surveying them, the vast majority feel, it's moving in the right direction or at least stabilized. So we're pretty happy with that. So, yes, a couple of things, I mean the defense businesses that we're seeing orders increase in those particular businesses tend to be our higher-margin businesses. So what I would expect that this kind of 28% EBITA margin, probably at some point over the next six months starts to tick higher, though I want to see that and we're doing budgets now and we're going through our budget cycle. So I want to really see that for sure. But that's kind of how it feels now. Commercial Aviation, I would expect to remain strong. A variety of space businesses for us, I think will remain strong from what I see orders being healthy. I think the other electronics, the other high-end electronics, as I said, I think, in the last two calls, those, I would expect to be softer and they're more tied to, let's say, the general economy and their own different cycles than the other businesses. And I think that will take a little bit of time to cycle through more than six months."

            "name": "Larry Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO third quarter fiscal '23 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation, and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's dedicated and talented team members who are responsible for another strong quarter of excellent results. They continue to produce the highest quality products and services for our customers, while maintaining our unique entrepreneurial corporate culture that has delivered excellent returns to shareholders. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to the approximate 1,000 HEICO-Wencor Group team members who recently joined the HEICO family. We look forward to our collective journey of exceeding customer expectations and winning in the marketplace. I, personally, have never been more optimistic about the future for HEICO. I'd like to now summarize the highlights of our third quarter fiscal record results. Consolidated third quarter fiscal '23 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued strong demand for our commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '23 improved by 16% and 27%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. These results mainly reflect a 12% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the impact from acquisitions. I'd like to note an important item. HEICO incurred acquisition costs from the Wencor acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal '23. And this decreased our net income by approximately $3.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The way management looks at our operations, we were able to report $0.74 a share earnings in the third quarter, after deducting this unusual $0.03 per share. So management considers our earnings in the third quarter as actually $0.77. Recognizing this, our operating margins, especially before Wencor related non-recurring deal expenses, that's what I was talking about, $3.5 million or $0.03, remained strong and are consistent with the expectations we previously communicated in investor calls and events. These margins are very healthy margins even though our product mix this year has meant lower overall margins than in prior years. Consolidated net income attributable to HEICO increased 24% and to $102 million or $0.74 per diluted share, of course, again, after deducting $0.03 of those special Wencor expenses in the third quarter of fiscal '23, and that was up from $82.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '22. In connection with the Wencor acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.75x as of July 31, '23, and that compared to 0.25x as of October 31, '22. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased in the first nine months of fiscal '23, and due to our successful offering of $600 million of 5.5% senior unsecured notes due August 1, '28 and $600 million of 5.35% senior unsecured notes due August 1, '33. We used the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund a portion of the Wencor acquisition purchase price. Cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong at $145.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, and that compared to $149.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. Cash flow provided by operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal '23, reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support increased consolidated backlog. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '23. In June, we were honored to announce that I will receive the prestigious 44th Annual Howard Hughes Memorial Award from the Aero Club of Southern California on Wednesday, September 6. The Howard Hughes Memorial Award honors exceptional leaders who have advanced field of aviation or aerospace technology. Upon receipt of the award, I will join 43 aviation and aerospace pioneers, including last year's honoree, Harrison Ford, as well as prior honorees, general Chuck Yeager, Bob Hoover, Neil Neil, general Jimmy Doolittle, Elon Musk, Jim Love, Maryland, Houston and captain Sully Sullenberger and many others. I'm profoundly honored to receive such a prestigious award from such a prestigious organization, though I believe it really belongs to all of HEICO's team members because it results from all of their remarkable work and success over several decades. The Aero Club of Southern California is recognized as one of the leading aviation and aerospace organizations in the world. And the idea that they would bestow this award upon me leaves me deeply humbled and very grateful. Last week, we announced that our 3D PLUS and Exxelia subsidiaries supplied mission-critical electronic components on India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which successfully executed a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole. We offer our congratulations to the Indian Space Research Organization, and we are honored to be a trusted supplier on this remarkable and historic mission. The level of sophisticated engineering, quality and precision demonstrated by our subsidiaries on this project was outstanding and commendable. I'd like to now discuss our recent acquisition activity. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Wencor for $1.9 billion in cash and approximately 1.1 million shares of HEICO Class A common stock with an assigned value of $150 million in the merger agreement or a total of $2.05 billion in the aggregate. The transaction was HEICO's largest ever in terms of purchase price as well as revenue and income acquired. We believe Wencor is a perfect and highly complementary fit with HEICO. And we expect the combination will be transformative, providing a unique and growing portfolio of proprietary cost saving solutions for our airline and OEM customers. We continue to anticipate this highly synergistic acquisition to be accretive to our earnings within the year following closing. In addition, HEICO anticipates that it will continue to achieve its often articulated growth objective in the years subsequent to the closing. Immediately following the closing, we forecast pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio will be approximately 3:1, and will return to historically low levels within roughly one year to 18 months after acquisition, excluding the impact of future acquisition or possible capital deployment activities. At this time, I would like to now introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the third quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric? Thank you, Victor. As for the outlook of HEICO in our opinion, as we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '23, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the FSG and ETG, divisions, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures may lead to higher material and labor costs. In addition, we've begun sharing the best practices and getting to know the Wencor businesses, which share a very similar entrepreneurial culture and customer focus as HEICO's businesses. We do believe the Wencor acquisition provides HEICO with additional scale to continue broadening our aerospace products and services, while maintaining our special culture of treating customers with respect and integrity. Our operating margins especially before non-recurring acquisition expenses remain very healthy and reflect our strong business operations. We believe our ongoing conservative policies and strong cash flows enable us to continuously invest in new research and development and take advantage of strategic acquisition opportunities, which collectively position HEICO for future market gains. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. I humbly welcome all of the Wencor team members to our family and look forward to winning new business together as one team. Thanks to all the HEICO team members for everything you do today to make HEICO an excellent company. I would now like to open the floor for questions. Thank you. Let me just kind of clarify one thing. The margins on Wencor and the margins on Exxelia are really different. And so Eric and Victor can speak to that. The margins on Wencor are pretty much in line with the margins of our Flight Support Group. But the margins on Exxelia are lower. But Eric and Victor can speak more detail to that. Well, I think we might have to take a little bit of a rest. We want to get, as we mentioned, get that debt down below three, and into the area of 2x EBITDA. However, I think there might be some bolt-on acquisitions. We're looking at a number of transactions we don't drop our M&A strategy just because of the two large acquisitions. And we are looking at them. And I think we will find ways to finance them at the same time, keeping the desire to get below 2x EBITDA. So, I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time. I think we can do it and we'll work that out. We'll work the financial arrangements out. As we are now were rated as a credit investment credit rating on our bonds. We want to keep that. We're very proud of that. In addition, it saves us interest cost. And so we will, again, push to get it down below 2x and or 2x. Prior to this Wencor, we have never been even at 2x EBITDA. So, I'll remind you of that. And we don't like leverage, strong leverage, so we're going to work towards that. But we -- I think we still will be able to make acquisitions and do both. Okay. This is Larry Mendelson, and we have no more questions. If any of you do have questions, you know that Eric, Victor, Carlos and I are available, give us a call, we'll try to help you out. And we thank you for participating in this call, and we look forward to speaking to you in the fourth quarter earnings call, which will be sometime towards the middle or end of December. So, thank you all and this is the end of the call."

            "name": "Eric Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much. First of all, I would like to welcome our new 1,000 Wencor team members into the new HEICO and Wencor family. This combination has been something that we've dreamed of doing for literally the past 20 years. And we could not be more excited and more overjoyed that this finally has come to fruition. Over the last number of weeks, I've been visiting Wencor facilities around the United States and have a very busy schedule plan for the next couple of months as I go out and meet all of the Wencor team members. I've been particularly impressed with the quality and the outstanding character and ability and DNA of the Wencor team members. You can never know what is going to happen down the road. And you never know exactly what it's like to work with people who have been in the same space, but you haven't gotten to know very well over many years. And I can tell you that our hopes and dreams have been completely fulfilled. As I've gotten to know the Wencor team members and their DNA, it is remarkably similar to HEICO's style and DNA. And it is something that I think is going to yield tremendous results for many, many years to come. So again, welcome to all of our new team members from Wencor. Going into the results. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 23% to a record $405 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $330.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 reflects robust 19% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '22 acquisition. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services, resulting from continued global commercial air travel growth as compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. The Flight Support Group has now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of growth in net sales, and these numbers don't yet include the positive impact we expect from the Wencor acquisition, which will further transform our business as the world's leading independent aftermarket supplier. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 26% to $89.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from $70.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The operating income increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in the previously mentioned acquisition costs related to the Wencor acquisition. The improved gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects higher net sales and a favorable product mix across all of our product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.0% in the third quarter of fiscal '23, up from 21.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '22. The operating margin increase in the third quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, partially offset by the previously mentioned acquisition costs, which reduced our operating margin by approximately 81 basis points. Our second quarter of fiscal '23 margin of 25.5% included a onetime benefit of 2.3%, yielding a 23.2% net operating margin on a continuing basis. Our third quarter of fiscal '23 margin was 22.8% before the unique costs related to the Wencor acquisition. We're very proud of these excellent operating margins, which have increased approximately 300 basis points from our then record 2019, and increased 400 basis points from our then record 2018. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Yes. So we're -- this is Eric. We're obviously very excited about the Wencor acquisition for some of the reasons that I mentioned earlier on the call. We think that it's a tremendous broadening of our product line. It's sort of amazing that you could have two companies sort of focused in different spaces. And now with the opportunity to bring them together, we're able to offer significantly more to our customers. And I can tell you that major customers have been extremely supportive of this business combination and have really been looking forward to the benefits that it's going to bring. And I think that's one of the reasons why we were able to secure antitrust approval so quickly, and because, frankly, our customers are really pushing us and very excited about this. So with regard to the margins, I would say that the Wencor EBITA margins are very similar to the flight support margins. Carlos can get into some of the specifics, but are basically within the same area. Obviously, there's going to be some intangible amortization as a result of those -- as a result of the acquisition. But as far as the EBITA earnings of the business, it's going to be, in general, in the same area as the HEICO businesses. And we do anticipate tremendous synergies going forward. Right now, we're all in a learning phase. We want to be very careful and make sure that we harness all of the benefits that this combination brings. Unlike many companies, we don't sort of set out with an operating margin target. We just simply want each of the businesses to perform to the best of its ability and to generate the margins that are correct for its long-term success. So if look at the Flight Support group, I'm really happy that our margins, people back in 2018 thought we were sort of at top margins, and now we're up 400 basis points from there. In 2019, they thought we were at top margins we're up 300 basis points. We did not set a target a specific target of a number where we want it to be. Instead, we just make the decisions that make sense, breach operating businesses and the margins end up where they are. So, I'm very encouraged that as a result of adding the Wencor product line that we're going to continue on this journey to improve margins. But in general, there -- the EBITA margins are in the same ZIP code as the flight support margins. Does that sort of answer your question? Yes. So Pete, let me start out by saying the market is incredibly strong. And we -- at the moment, we don't see any slowdown in sight. We -- having said that, we also understand that all recoveries are -- tend to end with a little bit of an overshoot and then things trend down just a little bit and then they resume their upward climb. I think one of the interesting things that may be going on now is that there's a lot of older equipment out there that really needs a lot of maintenance. And there has been a shortage of parts. The airlines still don't have as much as many parts as they need. And so we really see a lot of support in the market. So I don't see a slowdown in the cards right now. As far as China and Asia goes, those were the last to recover. So I don't think that we've even seen the full recovery there yet. So I think things are very strong in general. I mean, we're in this for the long haul. And whenever a little slowdown comes, to your point, I think that there's going to be a lot of synergy opportunities between HEICO and Wencor and being able to broaden our product lines. And I think we will continue to gain share and we'll move through that period. very well. So, I'm not concerned about it at all. Yes, I think that's fair. I mean, our business is always want to gain market share. We always believe in an expansionary opportunity. We don't work out of scarcity and we think that tomorrow always has greater opportunity than today. Having said that, we've got to make sure that we recapture our costs, and we maintain and grow our margins a bit. So I think due to the efficiency that we've got in the businesses, the operating leverage, I would anticipate that we're going to continue to move in a positive direction while continuing to generate huge value for our customers. I mean, we save our customers a lot of money. We treat them very, very well. They know that. And I think that's why, frankly, they were so supportive of the Wencor combination these two companies coming together is something which is really going to be very helpful to our customers. Thanks. I agree with you. I think that this one is a uniquely synergistic acquisition. It's something that we had to do, makes us a stronger competitor, much more efficient, brings more products to our customers. The other thing, Larry, that it does is as we share best practices, and we've already started doing this. Each company sort of focused in different areas. And I think there's a tremendous amount that we can learn by sharing those best practices and going to what I call the highest common denominator. If we are so fortunate as to have operating efficiencies, that would really be great news, one, because our costs would go down. But two, the combined HEICO and Wencor have over 100 unfilled job openings. And we've learned that our best and most productive team members typically come from inside, from inside of the businesses, they understand the culture. And we think that there's going to be great opportunities for the HEICO and the Wencor team members to take on expanded roles going forward. So, I think when you put all of that together, hopefully, the need -- we won't have to go out and hire as many people from the outside. And instead, we can promote from within. I think we're really in a very unique opportunity here. I want to be careful and not get too far over our skis before having the opportunity to get into the details because it's all detail driven. We don't come out with a model and say, okay, we expect you from the corporate office to cut cost by x and raise price by y, and do that. Some companies do that. It's extremely effective for them. What we have found in our very competitive businesses is the best thing is just to make the right long-term operating decisions. And if you do that, you plant the seeds and you reap the benefits for years to come. And so you've been around HEICO for a long time. And I don't think any of us back in 2018, 2019 thought that we would be increasing our operating margins by 300 basis points from '19, 400 basis points from '18 just through our standard operating procedure. So, I think that we've got that opportunity. Wencor is extraordinarily well run. They've got a DNA so similar to HEICO. They're very focused on the customer, very focused on efficiency getting it done, jumping through hoops for the customers. So there couldn't be a better marriage. So I couldn't be more optimistic. Everything that we had hoped for in the acquisition is proving true. So, we're -- I think we're well on our way. Good morning, Michael, and thank you for your comments. This is Eric. First of all, the short answer is yes. I want to be careful as to not get out and set expectations very high because we are in right now the process of HEICO understanding how the Wencor businesses operate, Wencor understanding how the HEICO businesses operate. So it's very, very important. We did not set out -- when we increased margins over the last five years by 400 basis points, we didn't do that by, if you will, setting a goal and then going towards that goal. Instead, what we did was made sure that we had really capable, hungry, talented, hard-working, honest people running each of their businesses and doing the best that they could possibly do. And that's exactly how Wencor operates. That's how HEICO continues to operate. So I personally am hopeful that we continue to increase these margins as time goes on. But I want to be careful as to not get ahead of ourselves and start predicting what those numbers are going to be. I'd rather -- and it's not a matter of under promising and over delivering. It's a matter of truly not knowing. We just make the right decisions and we do the right things. And that lays the foundation for a terrific groundswell of opportunity. So, I think it's important to go ahead and do that and continue doing that. But yes, I think the margins are going to increase. Now we do have, of course, the amortization that's coming from the Wencor acquisition, and Carlos can get into that. It's really important that everybody model that. But of course, that's a non-cash charge. It has nothing to do with the operating income of the business. I mean that's non-sensical charge, which actually we get a tax benefit from. So -- but yes, I think our margins are going to continue to do well. Carlos, I don't know if you want to get into some of the specifics there. Ken, I'd be happy to answer that. I would say that one quarter's growth rate has been very similar to HEICO's very comparable. They've done a great job in growing the PMA business, the repair, the distribution, the defense. So it's been very, very similar to HEICO. So -- and their operating philosophies, so similar to HEICO. That's why I think that there's going to be immediate opportunities to start working together. As a matter of fact, one of our businesses just send me an e-mail on Friday, he placed a $400,000 order with Wencor on a bunch of stuff. They didn't even know Wencor supplied before we started introducing some of the various folks. So I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity there. And -- but the growth rates, I would say, are really quite similar. Wencor has been extraordinarily aggressive in its markets. And it's sort of interesting that HEICO, Wencor sort of didn't bump up against each other very much. There's been relatively little overlap, and it's been in different areas. So, I think it is sustainable. Yes. I think they're very well positioned in each of the businesses. PMA is very strong and in areas complementary to HEICO in a lot of products that HEICO is not in. So, I think that by having a bigger supply basket that we can offer to our customers, we're going to generate a lot of value. Likewise, on the repair side, Wencor operates in a very decentralized autonomous entrepreneurial fashion, and they have focused in areas where HEICO wasn't by and large. So, I think that that's going to be very strong. Distribution has been phenomenal. They've captured a lot of lines, and they have a great relationship with their distribution partners and they've got a very robust pipeline. So, I think that's going to be good. And then in the defense market, they're relatively new to that, and they found some defense areas where we haven't been planning. So it's really adding to the product line. So I don't mean to not answer the question, but I would say I'm very optimistic on all four of Wencor's. And then really, HEICO's vertical, which I'm very also optimistic on, is our specialty products because Wencor doesn't manufacture things themselves, and they buy a lot of stuff. And the HEICO Specialty Products group manufactured, I mean that's our specialty to manufacture these basically, source-approved products. And I think that we're going to be able to make a lot of stuff for Wencor. Not necessarily that they're going to resource existing suppliers. They're very loyal to their existing suppliers. But I think on a go-forward basis, in the time when capacity is very tight, they're already asking our businesses to make product for them. So, I think our Specialty Products business is also going to be a beneficiary. But that's going to be over like a five-year period because it takes a while to get all of that manufacturing product digested. But I think it's going to be all across the Flight Support Group's five sort of operating verticals. Yes. So as you're aware, Sheila, so we disaggregate revenue into three areas: parts; repair; and specialty products. So, Wencor's business is going to be included in the parts and the repair section of the flight support numbers. So -- and my guess is that it's probably going to be roughly 1/3 repair, roughly 2/3 parts. And the parts includes both distribution -- maybe a little bit more on the parts side. The parts include distribution as well as PMA. So they're all growing very well that there's tremendous synergy opportunity between these businesses. So I think they're going to continue to do extraordinarily well. And as you know, there's a big interplay between those various areas because the repair businesses, obviously, require parts in order to repair their products and those come in, in the form of distributed product as well as PMA product. So I think it's going to be very strong there. That already gives you an idea, roughly, let's just say 70 -- one quarter is roughly, 70% parts, 30% repair in that general area. Well, for us, the aftermarket business is extremely strong. Back in last December, I thought that even though we weren't seeing any softening, that a softening would be inevitable and would come, and I was wrong. Things remain extremely strong. And I think that is a result of us capturing share, more people wanting to do more things with us. And I think, frankly, the future for us is very good. We don't see a softening as of now. And our backlog is tremendous. Some of our backlogs in some of the businesses are 2x the historical rate. So things are really strong. You've got an older fleet, which requires a lot of very expensive parts. And a lot of these, you can't MEL a lot of these components, and you've got to get them fixed. And I think things are continuing to remain strong. Yes, the day will come when we come off the top of it and the whole industry comes off the top a little bit and does a little bit of a dip. But I think, frankly, the industry is very, very well positioned and is going to go from strength to strength here. I don't think so. I think that the cycles are pretty short at both HEICO and Wencor. I think actually, that's probably one of the things that we may be able to help win quarter shorten some of the cycles. But I would say, in general, the cycles are very similar. I don't think there's going to be a major change in new product development spending. We're just going to continue doing the things that we've always done. And I think it's going to be very consistent. But by sort of putting together these baskets of products, it's just becoming a tremendous value to our customers. This is something that they really need -- they've expressed a lot of frustration when they can't get a part or they can't get a component. There have been a lot of shortages, both HEICO and Wencor, notwithstanding our big backlogs I think, have done a really good job with on-time delivery relative to the industry. And that's why I think our customers want to reward us with more business. Yes. There have been a couple of businesses, I would say, more in the specialty products area, where basically commercial OEM products, you're familiar with the -- sort of the vagaries of the commercial build market. Certain things are hot, certain things are not. So I would say there's been a little bit of a slowdown in some of that. I would say that's probably the area that has been if you will the slowest. But the backlogs are very strong. And I can tell you over on the defense side of our Specialty Products business, backlogs are enormous, and we're very optimistic for future sales. So I think we're very, very well positioned. I mean frankly, if we had the capacity right now, we could -- our specialty products in a number of businesses, could ship significantly more than they are. I mean we are just so busy. And yet we continue to add space and add real estate, add machines, add people. But just keeping up with the demand is really difficult. And these tend to be a little bit longer cycle. But I think both Wencor and the HEICO businesses, if they could, they would really load significantly more business into our specialty products, but we just don't have the capacity at the moment. Yes. I think there Wencor's cash profile is very similar to HEICO's. They -- as far as receivables and inventory, they have a very similar policy in terms of cash generation, I think it's going to be very, very similar to HEICO. Of course, we are going to have the -- as I mentioned in an earlier question, we will have the intangible amortization to contend with, but that's a non-cash charge. I mean that doesn't impact our cash. And as I mentioned, we even get a tax benefit for a chunk of it. So it helps cash. But it's, I would say, very, very similar. We've been very fortunate to acquire almost like our brother from another mother. I mean it's -- the businesses are just very, very similar."

I will now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to the HEICO Second Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another strong quarter. As I have said many times before, HEICO's strength comes from its people, our team members. Their commitment to our customers and the consistent delivery of high-quality products and services is what drives our excellent financial results for shareholders. I continue to be very optimistic about the future for HEICO and our over 9,000 team members. I'd like to summarize the highlights of the second quarter fiscal '23 results. They are record results. Consolidated second quarter fiscal '23 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group. This arose mainly from continued rebound in demand for commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal '23 each improved by 28% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. These results mainly reflect 10% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the impact from some acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 24% to $105.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and that was up from $85 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '22. Our total debt to shareholders' equity was 26.4% as of April 30, '23, and this compared to 11% as of October 31, '22. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $627.5 million as of April 30, '23 compared to shareholders' equity ratios was 21.9% as of April 30, '23, and this compared to 5.7% as of October 31, '22. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.4x, less than 1x, as of April 30, '23, and that compared to 0.25x as of -- October 31, '22. Both times were less than 1x EBITDA. The increase in our debt ratio in the first 6 months of fiscal '23 principally reflects the impact from financing the purchase of Exxelia in January '23. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $77.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and that compared to $96.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The cash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of fiscal '23 reflects an increase in working capital principally driven by an increase in inventory to support our increased consolidated backlog. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '23. As a personal comment, I always consider increase in inventories an indication of future growth in sales, so the increase in the inventory does not concern me. I will now discuss our recent acquisition activity. In March 23, we entered into an exclusive license and acquired certain key assets for the aircraft emergency locator transmitter, or as we call it in the industry, the ELT product line from Honeywell International, and this will fit nicely with the business operations of a subsidiary of the ETG Group. ELTs provide critical emergency transition signals in the event of aircraft impact on land or water to enable first responders to aircraft. We expect this license and asset acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in the year following closing. Earlier this month, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Wencor Group for $1.9 billion in cash and $150 million in HEICO Class A common stock, all to be paid at closing for a total of $2.050 billion in the aggregate. Upon closing, which is expected to occur by the end of calendar '23, Wencor would be HEICO's largest ever acquisition in purchase price as well as in revenue and income acquired. Wencor will become part of HEICO's Flight Support Group. Wencor is a large commercial and military aircraft aftermarket company, offering factory new FAA-approved aircraft replacement parts and value-added distribution of high use commercial and military aftermarket parts and aircraft and engine accessory component repair and overhaul services. Wencor is based in Peachtree, Georgia, and provides its parts and services internationally, employing approximately 1,000 team members in 19 facilities around the United States. HEICO recently entered into the financing arrangements to secure adequate funding for the Wencor acquisition. This acquisition is subject to government approval and customary closing conditions. The highly-synergistic acquisition is expected to be accretive to HEICO's earnings within the following year after closing. This acquisition materially expands HEICO's aftermarket product offerings and will enable the combined company to offer even greater savings and greater capabilities to customers while expanding our new products and services development capacity. Wencor is an ideal and perfect highly-complementary fit with HEICO. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the second quarter results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 28% to a record $392.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $306.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 reflects robust 20% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 51% to a record $99.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $66.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The operating income increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin and the impact the amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation expense. The improved gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects higher net sales within our Aftermarket Replacement Parts and Specialty Products product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 25.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from 21.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The operating margin increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and decreased SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the second quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 27% to a record $301.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $237.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions as well as increased net sales of our other electronics, aerospace and space products, offset by decreased defense products' net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 3% to $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $66 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned high net sales volume partially offset by a lower gross profit margin and lower efficiency levels, mainly resulting from the impact of our January '23 acquisition. The lower gross profit margin in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects decreased net sales of defense products, partially offset by net sales increases of our other electronics and aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23 as compared to 27.8% in the second quarter of fiscal '22. Keeping in mind that the ETG's noncash amortization is about 5 percentage points, this performance equates to what we consider to be the real operating margin metrics by which to measure a business of around 27.5%, which is a strong performance at the operating level and consistent with my prior comments about the rough range where I expected our margins to be. The lower yet strong operating margin principally reflects the previously-mentioned lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously-mentioned lower efficiencies. Our Defense sales remained lower than the prior year, as anticipated and as I discussed on our last earnings call. This overall reduced operating margin, despite the strong sales increases of our other electronics and aerospace products. In a little more detail on those sales, our Commercial Aviation sales and backlog have been particularly strong, and I would expect that to continue for some time. Sales of our other high-end electronic components have been healthy, though I still expect some softening in those markets overall as the year wears on. Our Commercial Space sales grew, and overall, we have a good products backlog, though deliveries are not linear over the course of the year. Exxelia, our largest ETG acquisition, has performed in line with our expectations so we are very happy with this acquisition. But as we've often explained, Exxelia's operating margins are lower than the average ETG segment margin -- operating margin. And consistent with our prior comments, we expect -- we continue to anticipate that Exxelia will reduce the consolidated average ETG operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points going forward. On supply chain, we continue to make progress in reducing our sales that have been delayed due to supply issues, with our subsidiaries now estimating that amount fell below $30 million, even into the mid- to low $20 million out Exxelia. The majority of our businesses tell us that overall supply conditions are either the same as or better than they were, and they anticipate continued, though uneven improvement throughout the year. Of course, we remain very confident in the ETG's outlook, both long and short term, as our ETG companies are a remarkable and irreplaceable set of businesses that are managed by gifted leaders and filled with talented team members. Further, given the combination of the ETG's record backlog, the overall expected delivery timing for that backlog and anticipated orders, we expect our Defense Product net sales to start to increase within the next year. Though, of course, we can never be certain of the timing and exact sales levels. I'll turn the call back to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '23, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the FSG and ETG groups, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher material and labor costs. During fiscal '23, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies, a strong balance sheet and a high degree of liquidity enables us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of periodic strategic inventory purchasing opportunity, as well as executing on our successful acquisition program. All these collectively position HEICO for continued growth and market share gains. In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Their persistent drive and determination to win in the marketplace has resulted in another quarter of outstanding results, and we thank you for all that you do to make HEICO a great company. I would now like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Rob Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: First, congratulations on the Wencor deal. I have a couple of questions on that. So Eric, if it's okay, if I could just start with you. I wanted to ask if you could perhaps offer some color on the differences between the 2 companies' PMA, distribution and component repair businesses, and how those complement one another?\nEric Mendelson: Great. Rob. I would be happy to. We're very, very excited about the Wencor deal because of the complementary nature of the transaction. If you look at their various businesses, their product lines really complement HEICO's very well. HEICO started out over in the PMA area focused on engine parts, Wencor has focused on non-engine parts. HEICO also does non engine parts, but there actually is very little similarity in the product that we do. And as a matter of fact, the HEICO component repair stations purchased all of the Wencor PMAs because HEICO doesn't offer those PMAs. So we're very excited about the complementary nature there. With regard to component repair, Wencor overhauls a lot of components and is in a lot of market niches where HEICO is not in, so we think that that's going to broaden us. And then likewise, in distribution, we focus in different areas. Wencor is, for example, has a very large position over in the bearings area whereas HEICO basically doesn't -- isn't involved in the bearings business. So we think that overall, this is going to permit HEICO to become a more efficient and stronger competitor by giving more products to our customers at lower prices, so we're very excited about it.\nRobert Spingarn: And so Eric, this isn't -- based on what you just said, this isn't just additive putting the 2 together, but it sounds like there's a pretty decent cross-selling opportunity where Wencor's customers can buy some more HEICO parts and the opposite.\nEric Mendelson: Absolutely. We feel very, very strongly about that. There's a whole product line that HEICO doesn't offer that we're going to now be able to offer to the airlines, and frankly, give them more choice, greater opportunity, greater savings, and it's really going to work out very well. Also, Wencor's got a whole set of manufacturers that makes product for them, and frankly, a lot of those manufacturers, I think can also make product for HEICO as well and vice versa. So we think it's really going to create a tremendous amount of efficiencies. And sort of lastly, HEICO has focused over the years more on, I would say, the airline market. Yes, we serve independent repair stations and brokers and smaller customers. But Wencor really has a world-class e-commerce system, e-commerce platform, which I think is going to be a really great value to our customers. So I mean, I know that our component repair stations' like buying parts from Wencor, so I think that as we bring the best that both companies have to offer, I think it's really going to be good for our customers.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And just to close the loop on this, Eric. I think normally, HEICO or FSG does about 300 to 500 new PMAs annually, get added to the catalog. I'm not sure what that equivalent number would be for Wencor. But should we assume that the pace of product development in addition to the catalog won't change for either company? Or is there a different answer there?\nEric Mendelson: Correct. I would say that it would definitely not go down, and it would probably go up as our -- as we offer -- as we've got a more fulsome product line to offer to our customers. I think that there's going to be additional development opportunities, yes, so we view it very much as additive. And in today's market, obviously, labor is very tight. We've got a great workforce. Wencor has got a great workforce. We share -- our DNA is very, very similar. Companies that view themselves as small compared to the very large companies in the industry, and we're really very much focused on product quality, turn time, service and pricing. And I think that there's -- it's really a great, great marriage. And frankly, something that we've all wanted to do for quite a long time, and I'm just happy that we are able to get it done.\nLaurans Mendelson: Rob, this is Larry. As a comment to summarize, we really believe that this combination is a great win for our customers because with expanded capacity and we believe that we'll be able to offer customers better pricing, lower pricing, more products and more efficiency. So we look at it not so much as a win for HEICO and Wencor, which I think it will be, but really a big win for the customers and the industry. As you know, HEICO exists because its pricing is below the OEM, and that's the reason that they buy our products, we're 30%, 40% below. And this will give us the capacity to give even more value.\nRobert Spingarn: Larry, Eric, thank you very much. Victor, Carlos, I had a couple for you, but I'll step aside.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Larry, Eric, Victor, Carlos. Victor, maybe I can just start with you. ETG margins are now kind of fully reflecting the inclusion of Exxelia. How should we think about the progression from margins to go back towards kind of the 27%, you mentioned the 200 basis points or the 2% kind of impact, but how are you thinking about that progression back?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Peter, this is Victor. It's a good question. Right now, I'm keeping our assumptions within close distance of where we are. I think you probably know, we're always fairly consistent -- excuse me, conservative when it comes to this. I do believe that as some of our defense products pick up later this year, first part of next year, which tend to be higher margin, that it should bring the margins north of where we are. But I'm more comfortable right now saying that we'll stick where we are. But you've always kind of heard me say that I think within more or less 10% of where we are is a healthy zone. Now of course, that excludes acquisitions, right? So acquisitions could change that materially, depending on what [indiscernible].\nPeter Arment: Yes, that's helpful. And then, Eric, just another one on margins. Just -- it seems like the March performance here continues to be incredibly impressive at FSG, but you mentioned the elimination of contingent agreements. Maybe just a clarification that -- how big was that? You said it was partially offset by stock comp. And just how do we think about kind of FSG margins here going forward? I know excluding Wencor, but just you've had really strong performance post-COVID. Just any clarification there would be helpful.\nCarlos Macau: Peter, this is Carlos. I'll take that one. The earnout on the 2021 acquisition, that was basically 2 tranches of earnout that we were going to pay, subject to operating performance levels. The company that has those earnouts with the prior owners, we believe more than likely would have made that earnout. We have probability weighted, the likelihood of that outcome to be a success for them. The seller requested a mechanism to get him his earnout sooner, and what we want up doing was renegotiating the earnout structure and paying them the $9 million of earnout basically this quarter versus paying it to them over the next -- I think the first tranche would have been done at the end of next year and the second tranche at the end of '26. So they basically monetized the earnout today and gave up the upside on the back end. I think the earnout would have been -- the first tranche, $9 million, second tranche $18 million, so he took $9 million or basically $27 million in possible earnings. And we thought that was a good deal for our shareholders, a good deal for the -- our partner, the owners of the company we bought, and that's how it all came about.\nEric Mendelson: And also just to add, the proposal to do this was from the -- from our partners, so this wasn't that HEICO initiated for both. So our partner came to us with the suggestion. We said, sure. If that's what you want to do, we're happy to go ahead and do it. Company is performing extremely well, and we couldn't be happier with it and with our partners over there. So it's I think, as Carlos said, a win-win. And then you also asked with regard to the margin. So post-COVID, HEICO has done very well. I think that we have shown to our customers that we started out as a very small company, and everybody's heard me say this 100 times. When you start out very small, you've got to make sure that you keep your customers happy. It's sort of obvious because if you don't do that, you're out of business. And we -- due to our approach of having inventory, we had inventory on the shelf and when, frankly, others ran out of inventory. And we continue to keep our people. We continue to work with the customers, and we added product lines, we added new parts. And as a result, we're doing really, really well. We also shrunk our footprint a little bit as a result of COVID due to some changes in the market, and I think we've become a lot more efficient. So all of this coming through, I mean, obviously, the $9 million isn't going to repeat. But even if you pull that out, the operating margin was above 23%, which is really very, very good. And again, that's in a period of time where we're making our customers happy and supplying parts to them and expanded product line at very, very competitive prices. So I really have to hand it to our team because frankly, in the corporate office, we just sort of make the acquisitions. But the folks in the field were the ones who figured out how to do this, and the numbers just roll up where they do. We don't tell them where to be. It's just that's what comes out of the machine at the end of the day. So I really have to commend them for this.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate all the color, and congrats on Wencor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nLawrence Solow: Great. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Maybe, Eric, we'll stick with you and just maybe some -- a little more color just on -- just on the Commercial Aviation. Just your markets, obviously, you grew 20% this quarter, and I think that was on top of like close to 25% organic growth in Q2 last year at 23%. We've recovered pretty much from COVID, I guess, or at least a narrow body, right, has recovered. Maybe you can give us a little color, narrow-body versus wide-body? And just recovery from COVID? Where we're going from here? Have you seen any change in order patterns or airlines holding more or less inventory? Any color there too would be great.\nEric Mendelson: Larry, thanks. I'd be happy to answer that. The sales -- the organic sales growth has really been, frankly, amazing. In Flight Support, we just had our eighth quarter of organic growth over 20%. So the one thing to have 4 quarters where you bounce back, but it's . And the numbers are, frankly, surprised me to the upside every single quarter, and there's a lot of strength out there. I think that the airlines are getting ready for summer season. They know that it's going to be really tough this summer. Everybody wants to fly, whether it's for leisure or business. And they are very, very conscientious and very focused to make sure that they complete those that fly. And so as a result, they make sure that they've got the inventory. I keep on asking our people, I meet quarterly with our sales leaders and I want to understand where we are. And they just see, frankly, continued strength. So Asia was -- it is the last region, if you will, to recover. A widebody is also the last of the fleet type to recover. But we see added interest in the stuff that we're doing, so we're able to bring on additional principles and develop additional parts and repairs. And I think it just in general, speaks to the market. I mean, ultimately, there will be a slowdown. We can't continue at this pace forever, and -- but I'm still very, very bullish that even when that slowdown or a little [indiscernible], which again, we don't see on the horizon right now. Even after that occurs, we're going to continue to ride right through this just as we had in the past. It's like impossible at a time -- impossible to time these things, and that's why we're so committed to the market.\nLawrence Solow: Got it. And I have just a follow-up just on the margin question, and Carlos can chime in. I think your margins ex the onetime benefit, like, for the segment year-to-date or in the first 2 quarters, close to 23%. Carlos, just how should we look at that going forward? Feel like you're operating close to -- all cylinders are close to it. Is this a high watermark? Should we tail back a little bit as you look out over the next couple of quarters and even now? Just your feeling on that.\nCarlos Macau: I mean, look, it's -- intention not giving guidance, so be careful about what I say. But I do think that we are in a circumstance right now in the business environment where the segment is performing extraordinarily well. You've got high growth, you've got good product mix, so we would love this to continue. And I think that if we're -- I think where we fall out candidly is between maybe '22 and '23 as a run rate type segment margin. But I don't want to make too many promises right now because we still have to settle into our footprint from the disruptions that were caused by COVID.\nLawrence Solow: Got it. Great. I appreciate that color. .\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: I guess maybe for Victor, ETG. Victor, just within Defense, obviously, there's been some supply chain issues. But kind of beyond supply chain, are you seeing areas where your Defense sales are strong, some areas where it's weak? Is it just kind of a timing mismatch right now in terms of what the Pentagon is prioritizing for purchases?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, this is Victor. So the answer is yes, and it's not unusual for us to have a variety of results in different businesses. It's maybe a little more pronounced between some of our higher and lower margin products and businesses now than it has been at other times. In some cases, we have backlog, but delivery is not due yet. In some cases, we're expecting some large orders, some of whom -- some of which have been delayed. Others are for foreign military use to maybe U.S. customers, or they may even go through the DoD, like FMS or things of that nature. So that's why we tend to have that optimism as we get a little bit further out. But it is, as you pointed out, this is a little bit of a mixed bag, which is not terribly unusual for us.\nPeter Skibitski: You don't feel like you've lost any market share? Or the competition has gotten particularly intense amongst suppliers?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, definitely not. We feel strongly we haven't ceded market share on any products or programs. It's more, in a sense, what they're buying at the particular moment. But we feel pretty good about the backlog and the orders and the order estimates going forward. But again, I'm not anticipating it as a next quarter change or even necessarily the quarter after that. I think it goes a little further and deeper into time based on when I look at our backlogs, our delivery schedules and some of the orders that we're anticipating.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay. So am I right, when you guys talk about Exxelia being 2 points of headwind, I think from a core perspective and some modest increase in amortization. So it still seems maybe you're down a couple of points year-over-year in underlying core margin at ETG, and so is that basically all mix essentially? So you really need defense mix to recovering ETG to get back to kind of the core level of margin that you did in the past year or 2? Is that the right way to think about it?\nVictor Mendelson: That's a good way to think about it. I think that's right. Or mix on some of the other higher-margin products that we have.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nVictor Mendelson: It doesn't have to be defense. Well, I think it's defense weighted.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: With the recent acquisition, once you complete this, I think Laurans, you mentioned that you expect net debt to EBITDA to be below 3x. But this leverage is still higher than where you've historically operated. How do you think about the debt load for the business going forward? I mean, when you look at the other main after -- commercial since aftermarket player, I mean, they could lever up as much as 7x net debt to EBITDA. So one, is this kind of the 3x as the new normal? Or do you anticipate to go where you've historically operated at below 1x? Or does this give you appetite for even further leverage, maybe not as much as 7x but maybe higher than 3x?\nLaurans Mendelson: So to answer that question, first of all, I want to emphasize that according to our projections, when we closed this transaction, Wencor, our debt-to-EBITDA will be under 3x. I think the number is 2.8x or 2.7x, Carlos?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. Net-net.\nLaurans Mendelson: Net-net will be under 3x. The reason that we insisted upon giving HEICO A shares in the transaction was the purpose to keep the leverage under 3x. HEICO has never been a highly -- as you mentioned, never been a highly leveraged company. Until now, we've never been above 2x. We've been below. Our projections show that within a year, we expect to be slightly below 2x again. So to answer your question, at this point, we are not thinking about becoming a highly leveraged company at 6x or 7x. We felt that taking leverage on at under 3x and being able to reduce it within approximately 1 year below 2x is consistent with our past practices of being very conservative on the leverage side. So the other thing that I want to point out that we don't give guidance, but we do tell the that we project. We try to grow 15% to 20% bottom line on an annual basis in this compound. We have done that pretty consistently for the past 30 years, and according again to our projections, we believe that we will be able to, in '24, grow within that 15% to 20% increase. Now of course, everything is dependent upon market conditions and everything else. But based on everything we know today, this acquisition will permit us to continue to compound at least in '24, and our leverage will be below 2x when we get to the end of '24. So I presume that we will continue to make smaller acquisitions as long as the leverage does not go up. So I don't know, does that answer your question?\nKristine Liwag: Yes, it does.\nOperator: Our next question from Pete Osterland with Truist Securities.\nPeter Osterland: I'm on for Mike Ciarmoli this morning. First, I just wanted to ask one on the Wencor acquisition. Given that historically you've operated acquired companies on more of a stand-alone basis, how are you thinking about the integration of Wencor into HEICO? Are there any preparations you're making that you can talk about that are perhaps different than for some of the acquisitions you've made in the past?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. It's a great question, and something we've been thinking about quite a bit. Wencor is a very, very well-run company, and they've got tremendous asset in their people. So frankly, our plan at the moment is just to acquire it and believe it as a separate stand-alone company for the near term. Let's see what benefits could exist between the 2 companies over time, we'll share best practices and we'll figure out how to serve our customers even better. So I think there's obvious areas where we can help each other continue to grow and improve, but the plan is to believe it is a separate stand-alone company for the moment.\nPeter Osterland: All right. That's helpful. And then just kind of a follow-up on some of those synergies that you might expect from the Wencor acquisition. Do you expect that as a combined company, it might give you an opportunity to speed up development of new PMA parts? Or do you anticipate there might be any benefits related to scale in terms of working to get PMA parts approved?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, that's also a great question. In terms of scale and getting PMA parts approved, we've got a great track record with the FAA to be able to get parts approved so I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to add to that. Wencor has, as I mentioned earlier, a product line that HEICO doesn't offer so I think that this is going to add to the portfolio. And yes, it will speed up the development because right now, for example, HEICO wants to develop the type of part that we haven't done in the past, whereas Wencor has done that type of part in the past then we would be able, yes, to develop it more quickly. So I think that that's going to be a benefit. Also, when we go to customers, very often, customers ask for a broader product line. And by adding the 2 product lines together, we're going to be able to cover a lot more of the waterfront. And so we're very excited about all the benefits that that's going to bring.\nPeter Osterland: Great. Well, congrats on the acquisition.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Congratulations. Larry, I want to ask you a question first. You mentioned inventory and supply chain a few times in your prepared remarks, and you guys have typically done very well with cash conversion. So maybe can you talk about that? And Eric, you also referred to inventory and having supply ready for customers. Is this something new? Is it specific to a certain business? And maybe -- if you could talk about that.\nLaurans Mendelson: No, I think two things were happening. Number one, our backlog is larger, and to fill that backlog to supply the customers on time, we have to have inventory. So that went up. Number two, because of supply chain issues, our subsidiaries want to make sure they have inventory on the shelf to meet the customers' demand. So those 2 things increased the inventory. And that was the main increase, I think, in inventory.\nEric Mendelson: And then also, Sheila, to add to that. We are anticipating additional growth in the businesses and in particular, over in the distribution side. Picking up additional principles, additional territories, so we had to grow inventory for that. And then also, I think everybody is pretty aware of the extended lead times in the industry. Product that used to have 4-week, 8-week lead times now can have anywhere from 26 to 52 week lead times. And we want to make sure that we are able to service our customer and we've got the parts on the shelf. And as a matter of fact, the head of our distribution business told me this morning that a very major, major industry player out there who is a very big customer, we've got 98% on-time delivery in a market where we are having the place of the 52-week lead times for the products to which we are distributing to that. So in the -- the way we're able to get 98% of this particular business on time delivery when others are dozens of points below that, is by holding the inventory. So we want to be there for our customers. We've never been cash constrained. We want to make sure that we invest in the right inventory. It doesn't do any good to have the wrong inventory, obviously. But we got the right inventory, we make our principals happy, and we're able to service our customers. So I think that's really why inventory has increased and we think it's the right thing to do.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Victor, maybe for you with Exxelia. I mean, obviously, we all understand that it's lower margin, but is it lower margins now? Is there something structural in the business? Or is it just a factor of its footprint?\nVictor Mendelson: Look, it's a good margin business in absolute terms. It's just not as high margin as the rest of the business. Their margins have been increasing over the last several years. I think that I would expect that to continue, but I don't anticipate it's going to get to the same margin as the rest of the ETG in the near term at least or in the next couple of years, absent some acquisition or acquisitions which would change that story. So we're very happy with the margins. They're very good, but just not as high as the rest. And that went into our acquisition decision.\nLaurans Mendelson: By the way, Sheila, in past conferences, we have stated that the ETG Group would acquire a strong company that had a lower margin than -- I mean, when ETG was 28% or 33%. We always said, if we bought a company that had close to 20%, it's going to lower the average margin. But the cash and profit generation and the size of the acquisition of Exxelia warranted us saying, fine, we'll lower -- we'll take a lower operating margin because this is a very fine company. And by the way, it has great management, and we believe it has the ability to grow. So those things overrode the desire. It would have been great to have higher margin. We do believe that as we build in some efficiencies, that margin can creep up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company.\nJoshua Sullivan: I'm going to comment of doing PMA parts you haven't maybe done in the past using possibly some of Wencor's expertise, what is your appetite to expand the PMA waterfront? Where might you go with PMA you haven't gone in the past?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it's a great question and it's something that we thought quite a bit about. We think that there's a whole set of parts that we just haven't been able to tap as efficiently. And if you look at HEICO's sort of developed a certain skill, engineering skill set to go after the types of parts that HEICO does and Wencor has done the same for the parts that they have done. And by being able to focus in each of those areas, I think there's going to be a lot more that we can do together. A lot of these parts made up, so you can have a complex part next to it. That's a complex part, but the 2, there's certain interaction between them. And so this is really going to help us develop a much fuller product set because we're going to be able. But basically, we'll be able to expand into areas that we haven't done in the past.\nJoshua Sullivan: And then just on the growth of PMA in general, there's some thought PMAs have benefited from some of the struggling OEM supply chain issues. How should we think about that dynamic? If and when OEM supply chains recover, do you still think PMA growth will be strong in the years?\nEric Mendelson: Well, I sure hope so. We think that there's really been a permanent shift and change in the industry. So we've been out there, both HEICO and Wencor have been out there preaching to the customers for whatever, 50 years about PMA, and it's taking in a certain period of time. But you know the old saying, what is it, that necessity is the motherhood of invention? And so we've been out there with, frankly, as good technical product, if not better. And don't get me wrong, our -- the OEM companies out there supplying the market, they supply very, very fine products. So to supply products that are the same as the OEM is quite a technical challenge. And then frankly, in order to have the products on the shelf, that really takes a tremendous amount of effort. So I think we are in a very, very good position to continue to grow our sales. And we compete with the OEMs, and they are really high-quality, excellent companies and they're really, really tough to compete with because they offer a very broad product set at -- with an outstanding quality. So we think that this is the opportunity to obviously bring multiple products together and be able to compete with the OEMs on a better basis. Also, I have to say, I don't want to mention which ones, but even OEMs have now moved to buying both HEICO and Wencor PMA product because if they don't have the parts on the shelf and they've got to shift even their own repaired units. And again, I don't want to go into which ones or what they are, but they purchase our parts to go ahead and do that, saying we're happy to sell it to them. So I think it's really coming together, and there is what I believe is a permanent market shift in how HEICO and Wencor products are viewed in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds.\nGeorge Bancroft: Well done on the quarter, very nice. Just -- maybe could you just frame -- could you frame maybe what else is out there in the PMA market? Who else participates there besides the Wencor's? It sounds like they're one of -- I mean, small relative to you, but larger ones out there. Is that where you want to focus going forward? And maybe -- just maybe talk about that.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Tony, this is Eric. I'd be happy to go ahead and go over that. There's a long list of competitors who supply PMA parts there. And I don't want to call them out by name, but they exist and our customers know who they are and they work with them, and so I think that will continue. Our area really for future acquisitions, I wouldn't say is in the PMA area. Our area for future acquisitions would be -- I want to be careful not to because we welcome our competitors to this call, but we don't want to exactly tell them what we're going to be going out after. But we think that there are a lot of adjacent white spaces in which HEICO does not participate. Many, many. And HEICO is still, even though we've done quite nicely, we're still a very small company and there's so much more to do out there. So I think we're going to grow, we're going to focus in areas that are additive and really broaden our product set so we can bring more -- we can become a more efficient and stronger competitor and be able to bring more products to the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Ducharme with Sterling Capital.\nColin Ducharme: Quick housekeeping for Victor, Carlos on ETG. Did you give the organic sales number for that segment for the quarter as though I missed it? And then a follow-up, I'll just ask them all at the same time here. A follow-up on just pulling the thread for the Wencor deal for Eric and/or Larry. I wanted to maybe pull that thread with -- using kind of 2 lenses, the strategic and financial. So strategic, you talked about the marriage of both PMA franchises. But can you talk about perhaps marriage of distribution and PMA? And what I mean by that is it sure looks like Wencor has put more muscle in recent periods into signing exclusive distribution agreements, and I'm wondering if you can now bring to bear your larger PMA catalog and marry them with some of those distribution agreements? That seems like a logical strategic synergy there. And then from a financial lens, in your previous responses, you talked about not doing anything different or special with integrating this culture and then having the same DNA as you all. We kind of view the real asset of HEICO is your culture. And one differentiator, if you look at this asset now, Wencor in prior years, you're talking about a business that has borne the load of a debt load 6x, 7x, 8x EBITDA, and that burden is significant. It does inhibit some reinvestment. And now, they're going to be able to benefit from a much stronger financial model. So can you just talk a little bit about that? That DNA looks and smells a little different in terms of opportunity and the capacity to reinvest, and so I would just love to hear you tee off with some opportunities there.\nLaurans Mendelson: Yes. Let me make one comment. Wencor was owned by private equity, and their model is heavy leverage. HEICO, when it closes, will own Wencor and our model is low leverage. So that leverage situation will totally disappear. Yes Eric wants to.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. And Colin, I mean these are really great questions, and I'm glad you're hitting on them. Both HEICO and Wencor are in the distribution market, and the unique benefits that we bring to our distribution partners is that we're able to -- first of all, we both very much focus on the details. Starting out as small companies, we really focused to make sure that we get maximum benefits to the customers, making sure that they know what's available for [indiscernible] that we get the products sold. But the other area of similarity is both HEICO and Wencor have been able to bring 2 distribution partners the ability to develop additional parts that they don't already offer in their catalog. And I'm glad you're mentioning this, because this is something that we've been thinking about. HEICO, to date, we have distribution partners and we've got the ability to develop certain PMAs and we're known at the airlines for developing those PMAs. But for the existing distribution partners that we've got, there's a whole set of additional parts that Wencor can bring to the HEICO distribution partners and really help them, and likewise, HEICO can bring to the Wencor distribution partners. So I think that this is going to increased competition in the distribution aftermarket and make the products that go into the airlines just being that much bigger, so they're going to be able to save a lot more money on it. So that was on the strategic side. You asked also about financial and the culture side. The businesses, the people are really, really similar. Again, as I said, focused on the detail, focused on quality, making sure that we're out there with the customers, whatever they need, when they need it, we move heavy on earth for them, and that is identical in both HEICO and Wencor. And you're right that the people are the real assets, I mean, that's the most important part of the business by far. And Wencor has been constrained as a result of having -- being private equity owned, and they have been constrained. And I think frankly, HEICO's lower leverage is going to free the Wencor people to be able to go out and sell additional product, take additional inventory positions, call it additional inventory, if that's what makes sense, broadly what they do. And again, that's going to help our customers because the more we sell them by definition, the more they make. I mean we've got, by definition, competition on pretty much every single thing that we offer. And our competitors are these big, huge companies that do a phenomenal job and are really, really hard to compete with. So Wencor, in a sense, has had one hand tied behind its back for the last number of years. And now, we're going to be able to go out and free that hand. And I think it's going to work out really, really well for our customers. And then I think you had some ETG. Carlos or.\nCarlos Macau: I got to follow that. All right, so you asked about the ETG. For the quarter, it was down 3% organically, most of that driven by Defense. The other slips within the ETG organically were all up. They were either flat compared to the prior quarter or were all up, so that's the quarter. And I think for the year, it's similar. It was some around, year-to-date, around 2% down for the segment on organic growth.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Can you frame your market share now in PMA and then where Wencor sits in that respect? And it sounds like you do not foresee any issue in terms of closing with that combined size in PMA. Is that because the combined PMA there would still be small as a percentage of total PMA? Or because it would still be small as a percentage of total aerospace broad aftermarket?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We don't know specific shares because it's impossible to get that information. But our competitors, as we've always said, are the OEMs. And when you look at the OEM aftermarket sales, I mean, we are -- we've always said that we are absolutely tiny, tiny compared to them. So this is going to give us the ability to compete better with the OEMs. So we still view our market share as very small. We think the product into which we can grow is very, very considerable, so that's why we're very optimistic for the future and why we think that there is really a lot of opportunity here.\nNoah Poponak: Were you able to, in the diligence process, look into whether or not market share and just PMA would be a factor?\nEric Mendelson: No. I mean, look, we study everything, but the -- as I've always said, and I've been asked on these calls for 20 years about what are the factors in the marketplace that affect us the most, and it's always been the OEMs. It's always been. I mean the OEMs, they have the home field advantage, they're selling the original product. They're in there. They got point of sale ability. When they sell the asset, they're able to tie up the maintenance long term. They offer a full product set. That's always been our competition. So my -- I mean, if you had to pin me down and get what our market share, the combined market share against aftermarket parts, I guess it's in the 2% area. I mean, it's very, very small, and that's what I think there is a lot of opportunity to really grow. And frankly, look, it's 2%. We're never going to be -- we're never going to have the sales of some of these very large companies. But I think we can continue to grow our product line and be able to offer more product at very good prices to our customers and save them a lot of money. I mean, the airlines are saving a fortunate as the result of our products. And if they're able to do that and we're at 2%, I think they'll be able to save even more as we move forward here.\nLaurans Mendelson: No. As -- this is Larry. As you know, the OE generally has a monopoly position in replacement parts. He starts off with offering the only available parts. If they want to replace parts, they have to go to the OE. HEICO has a tiny share because of its PMA, but PMA has succeeded because of its price benefit to the airlines. So we offer a much greater value to the airlines, and that's where our competitive advantage exists. So that -- you know what the marketplace looks like, but we are very small compared to what the market is. And we only -- essentially, we said we only compete with ourselves. So we try to grow the bottom line 15%, 20%, but that's a tiny share of the overall market.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. I appreciate all that. I just had 2 more. One, was the accelerated earnout or the contingent consideration, was that in the FSG segment EBIT and EBIT margin in the quarter?\nCarlos Macau: It was, Noah. The $9 million was a liability on our balance sheet up through the middle of Q2, and then we reversed it when we renegotiated the transaction. It went through EBIT in the segment. So there was about 2.3% worth of benefit to the OEM margin related to this matter.\nNoah Poponak: So Carlos, I guess that's a pretty sporty margin if I adjust that.\nCarlos Macau: Yes.\nNoah Poponak: Should I work from there going forward? Or does that have some other favorable timing that doesn't repeat in the near term? Or how should I think about the next steps there?\nCarlos Macau: So look, I'm always conservative when we talk about margins because really, who knows, right? But I would say and what I've told people pretty consistently is that we're in an extraordinary time right now where the business is growing and growing. We have product and our sales, as Eric pointed out, was it 8 quarters of 20% or higher growth? So when you're in an environment like that, you get tremendous leverage on your fixed costs, you get favorable product mix, et cetera. I am cautiously optimistic that the margins will remain high. Today, I'm more optimistic they would be higher than it was yesterday. What's that number? If I'm modeling I'm thinking 22% to 23% might be the norm for the segment, but I can't tell you that with great specificity because we need the business to calm down, if you would. The industry came down, take a pause, et cetera. And once we see what the footprint looks like, it will be an easier question to answer. But right now, all businesses within the Flight Support Group are firing on all cylinders. So this -- this is what you get in a period like this, and we'll see where it shakes out once the industry growth came down a little bit.\nNoah Poponak: Interesting. Okay. And then what was the organic growth or decline in just Defense within ETG revenue?\nCarlos Macau: So it was double digits. It was in the low teens, and that's been a little better than it had been in prior quarters. And I think that Victor pointed out, I think the trend is that we're starting to see a little bit of life in the Defense segment. And hopefully, for the ETG hopefully, that plays itself out towards the back half of the year.\nNoah Poponak: Defense was down double digits in the quarter?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. In ETG. It was up quite nicely in the FSG, by the way, but it was down in the ETG. Defense Electronics, in particular, has been soft for about the last 4 quarters.\nNoah Poponak: And it sounds like you expect that to maybe be a little better in the back half, but probably still down year-over-year? Is that what you're looking for?\nCarlos Macau: That's what we're hoping for, yes. If you look at the backlog and the timing of deliveries, as Victor talked about earlier, that's what we think is going to play out.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.\nLouis Raffetto: Eric, you've provided some really good thoughts on the FSG business in Wencor. I guess as we think about product development, you kind of mentioned you guys did some parts, Wencor did other parts, but you guys could maybe leverage each other. I guess how do you think about HEICO wanting to do a part that maybe Wencor would have done in the past? How do you manage that going forward?\nEric Mendelson: In general, I would say that in the past, if Wencor already had a part, HEICO would not develop the part. So they really sort of play, if you will, very much in 2 sandboxes. So we think that we're really going to be able to get best of breed here, whereby each business can focus on what it does exceptionally well. And also, there's a lot of engineering and technical tools that each company uses, frankly, that can improve the process of the other company as well. And I think all of this put together is just going to benefit the customer with a broader product set in going into areas where we -- where we haven't gone into in the past. I'm reluctant, as you can imagine, Louis, to get into specificity because we don't want to tip people off as to where we're going. But we think that there's a lot of stuff to be developed where no alternative exists now, and we're going to be able to go that stuff.\nLouis Raffetto: Right. I guess, Victor, one for you. In the press release and on the call, you kind of mentioned these lower efficiencies or lower level of efficiencies due to Exxelia. I guess I'm just trying to understand exactly what that means. Is that just sort of the drop-through of the dilution? Or was there some other level of lower efficiencies as a result of the deal? Did something else happen?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I think it's just the drop-through of the dilution.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Just wanted to make sure that was it. And then just one last one for Carlos. The 2.7x to 2.8x leverage multiple you kind of mentioned and Larry mentioned, to be clear, that's not pro forma, that's just kind of adding the $1.9 billion? I guess, technically, if you kind of give yourself credit for that EBITDA, I think it should be lower, probably under 2.5x. Is that correct?\nCarlos Macau: We'll see. I mean I think the net leverage in our model is supposed to be around $2.8 million. We'll see how much is outstanding on our line. When we [indiscernible], it will all be dependent on how much debt we pay down between now and closing, so -- but that's where our best forecast is right now.\nLouis Raffetto: Sorry, but is that including any EBITDA from Wencor? Or is that just sort of the HEICO EBITDA and then the Wencor ?\nCarlos Macau: It would be the pro forma earnings for both companies.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, on the Wencor multiple, you guys are paying for it. Maybe just a little bit of background on the sale process? Like it seems like a fairly low multiple, all things considering. Was it an auction? If you could just describe some of the background to how this acquisition came about?\nLaurans Mendelson: First of all, it's a good question. We have known about Wencor for many years. We were aware of it. In previous times, we try to buy it at much lower prices. There was an auction. We were competing with some -- what we consider pretty well-financed private equity groups. We don't feel that we paid a low price. We feel that we -- actually, I feel that I pay a high price, and much higher than we had really wanted to pay. So the auction pushed us up, and we paid what I consider and we consider a market price.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So I mean look, obviously, we always try to do right by HEICO shareholders so we want to pay a most reasonable price possible. It was very competitive. There was a lot of interest in the company, and we think that it was a fair price for this business. I mean, it's a large business. It's a large asset. It's much bigger than anything we bought in terms of earnings or people, revenue. So I think overall, it's a fair price for -- it's a very fair price for the business, and we're really excited going forward. There is, as we said, great opportunities for our customers. So overall, we think it's going to work out very well.\nGautam Khanna: And perhaps could you just frame -- on paper, looks very accretive, but then there's amortization and other deal-related costs. What is your expectation for earnings accretion in '24 and then perhaps in '25? Just to help frame it.\nCarlos Macau: Well, I'll tell you what, I'd be happy to answer that question for you when we close. At the moment, we've signed a deal but we haven't closed it. So I rather not get into forecasting that stuff until we've actually closed on the deal.\nGautam Khanna: Fair enough. Curious, Eric, if you can talk about mix within the quarter? Specialized products versus the other 2 subsegments at FSG, if that helps kind of the margins in the quarter?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, they -- look, all the businesses had very similar organic growth between parts and distribution, specialty products and the repair. So I mean, they were all in sort of similar areas. Some parts of the business have higher margins than other parts of the business, but overall, we're pleased with the development in each. We think that specialty products, there's still plenty of tailwind to cover because the OE cycle has not fully recovered. And we think that we are, frankly, best of breed in what we do over in the specialty products area. And I think that there is a lot of opportunity, a lot of opportunity for us here to continue to grow and do well and as the business -- as the industry recovers. And also, when you specifically talk about specialty products, Wencor doesn't have a manufacturing capability, or relatively minimal. And this is one of the other very complementary features of the deal because we've got some really outstanding, truly, truly best-in-class manufacturing capabilities within our Specialty Products group. So while Wencor will continue to be loyal to its existing suppliers as we develop additional product going forward, I think that there's going to be a very, very good capability for Wencor to use some of the HEICO Specialty Products businesses as manufacturers. And also, we'll be able to create some redundancy so we don't just have single sources for some of these products. We're really good at this machining, sheet metal fabrication and composites, various stuff that we do. And I think that that's going to provide opportunities for Wencor to grow their product set to get into areas where perhaps traditionally, they have gotten into because they didn't have a supplier to be able to make something which is somewhat similar to what they've done, but different. So I think Specialty Products is going to be a great asset for the combined company going forward.\nGautam Khanna: And just one last one. I was wondering if you could comment on whether there are any, maybe regions, that are still lagging with respect to demand that has -- still have a big catch-up opportunity? If there's anything you can say by customer set or region or some other way?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We look at the sales. And I mean, obviously, in Asia, things have not fully recovered, and likewise in South America. I think that there continues to be opportunity, if you will, recovery coming out of COVID. Frankly, in our other markets, we're way ahead of where we used to be where we were pre-COVID, and we're doing extraordinarily well. And I think, again, that's a result of just being able to sell more stuff. So I think that there's added recovery opportunity. In particular -- and I think everybody is aware of the widebody in Asia. I mean, that's the last thing to come back, and so there's a very good opportunity there.\nOperator: And there are no additional questions at this time.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody who participated on this call, people who asked questions and those who were just listening. I want to remind you that if you do have questions, give us a call. We'll try to respond to them. And unless you have any other comments or questions, I want to again thank the HEICO team members. They are the guys who make it happen and they do a phenomenal job. And we will -- in another 3 months, we will have another third quarter earnings call. Thank you all, and this is the end of our prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Peter, this is Carlos. I'll take that one. The earnout on the 2021 acquisition, that was basically 2 tranches of earnout that we were going to pay, subject to operating performance levels. The company that has those earnouts with the prior owners, we believe more than likely would have made that earnout. We have probability weighted, the likelihood of that outcome to be a success for them. The seller requested a mechanism to get him his earnout sooner, and what we want up doing was renegotiating the earnout structure and paying them the $9 million of earnout basically this quarter versus paying it to them over the next -- I think the first tranche would have been done at the end of next year and the second tranche at the end of '26. So they basically monetized the earnout today and gave up the upside on the back end. I think the earnout would have been -- the first tranche, $9 million, second tranche $18 million, so he took $9 million or basically $27 million in possible earnings. And we thought that was a good deal for our shareholders, a good deal for the -- our partner, the owners of the company we bought, and that's how it all came about. I mean, look, it's -- intention not giving guidance, so be careful about what I say. But I do think that we are in a circumstance right now in the business environment where the segment is performing extraordinarily well. You've got high growth, you've got good product mix, so we would love this to continue. And I think that if we're -- I think where we fall out candidly is between maybe '22 and '23 as a run rate type segment margin. But I don't want to make too many promises right now because we still have to settle into our footprint from the disruptions that were caused by COVID. Yes. Net-net. I got to follow that. All right, so you asked about the ETG. For the quarter, it was down 3% organically, most of that driven by Defense. The other slips within the ETG organically were all up. They were either flat compared to the prior quarter or were all up, so that's the quarter. And I think for the year, it's similar. It was some around, year-to-date, around 2% down for the segment on organic growth. It was, Noah. The $9 million was a liability on our balance sheet up through the middle of Q2, and then we reversed it when we renegotiated the transaction. It went through EBIT in the segment. So there was about 2.3% worth of benefit to the OEM margin related to this matter. Yes. So look, I'm always conservative when we talk about margins because really, who knows, right? But I would say and what I've told people pretty consistently is that we're in an extraordinary time right now where the business is growing and growing. We have product and our sales, as Eric pointed out, was it 8 quarters of 20% or higher growth?

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 27% to a record $301.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $237.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase principally reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions as well as increased net sales of our other electronics, aerospace and space products, offset by decreased defense products' net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 3% to $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $66 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned high net sales volume partially offset by a lower gross profit margin and lower efficiency levels, mainly resulting from the impact of our January '23 acquisition. The lower gross profit margin in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects decreased net sales of defense products, partially offset by net sales increases of our other electronics and aerospace products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23 as compared to 27.8% in the second quarter of fiscal '22. Keeping in mind that the ETG's noncash amortization is about 5 percentage points, this performance equates to what we consider to be the real operating margin metrics by which to measure a business of around 27.5%, which is a strong performance at the operating level and consistent with my prior comments about the rough range where I expected our margins to be. The lower yet strong operating margin principally reflects the previously-mentioned lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly from the previously-mentioned lower efficiencies. Our Defense sales remained lower than the prior year, as anticipated and as I discussed on our last earnings call. This overall reduced operating margin, despite the strong sales increases of our other electronics and aerospace products. In a little more detail on those sales, our Commercial Aviation sales and backlog have been particularly strong, and I would expect that to continue for some time. Sales of our other high-end electronic components have been healthy, though I still expect some softening in those markets overall as the year wears on. Our Commercial Space sales grew, and overall, we have a good products backlog, though deliveries are not linear over the course of the year. Exxelia, our largest ETG acquisition, has performed in line with our expectations so we are very happy with this acquisition. But as we've often explained, Exxelia's operating margins are lower than the average ETG segment margin -- operating margin. And consistent with our prior comments, we expect -- we continue to anticipate that Exxelia will reduce the consolidated average ETG operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points going forward. On supply chain, we continue to make progress in reducing our sales that have been delayed due to supply issues, with our subsidiaries now estimating that amount fell below $30 million, even into the mid- to low $20 million out Exxelia. The majority of our businesses tell us that overall supply conditions are either the same as or better than they were, and they anticipate continued, though uneven improvement throughout the year. Of course, we remain very confident in the ETG's outlook, both long and short term, as our ETG companies are a remarkable and irreplaceable set of businesses that are managed by gifted leaders and filled with talented team members. Further, given the combination of the ETG's record backlog, the overall expected delivery timing for that backlog and anticipated orders, we expect our Defense Product net sales to start to increase within the next year. Though, of course, we can never be certain of the timing and exact sales levels. I'll turn the call back to Larry Mendelson. Yes. Peter, this is Victor. It's a good question. Right now, I'm keeping our assumptions within close distance of where we are. I think you probably know, we're always fairly consistent -- excuse me, conservative when it comes to this. I do believe that as some of our defense products pick up later this year, first part of next year, which tend to be higher margin, that it should bring the margins north of where we are. But I'm more comfortable right now saying that we'll stick where we are. But you've always kind of heard me say that I think within more or less 10% of where we are is a healthy zone. Now of course, that excludes acquisitions, right? So acquisitions could change that materially, depending on what [indiscernible]. Yes, this is Victor. So the answer is yes, and it's not unusual for us to have a variety of results in different businesses. It's maybe a little more pronounced between some of our higher and lower margin products and businesses now than it has been at other times. In some cases, we have backlog, but delivery is not due yet. In some cases, we're expecting some large orders, some of whom -- some of which have been delayed. Others are for foreign military use to maybe U.S. customers, or they may even go through the DoD, like FMS or things of that nature. So that's why we tend to have that optimism as we get a little bit further out. But it is, as you pointed out, this is a little bit of a mixed bag, which is not terribly unusual for us. Yes, definitely not. We feel strongly we haven't ceded market share on any products or programs. It's more, in a sense, what they're buying at the particular moment. But we feel pretty good about the backlog and the orders and the order estimates going forward. But again, I'm not anticipating it as a next quarter change or even necessarily the quarter after that. I think it goes a little further and deeper into time based on when I look at our backlogs, our delivery schedules and some of the orders that we're anticipating. That's a good way to think about it. I think that's right. Or mix on some of the other higher-margin products that we have. It doesn't have to be defense. Well, I think it's defense weighted. Look, it's a good margin business in absolute terms. It's just not as high margin as the rest of the business. Their margins have been increasing over the last several years. I think that I would expect that to continue, but I don't anticipate it's going to get to the same margin as the rest of the ETG in the near term at least or in the next couple of years, absent some acquisition or acquisitions which would change that story. So we're very happy with the margins. They're very good, but just not as high as the rest. And that went into our acquisition decision. Yes, I think it's just the drop-through of the dilution."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to the HEICO Second Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another strong quarter. As I have said many times before, HEICO's strength comes from its people, our team members. Their commitment to our customers and the consistent delivery of high-quality products and services is what drives our excellent financial results for shareholders. I continue to be very optimistic about the future for HEICO and our over 9,000 team members. I'd like to summarize the highlights of the second quarter fiscal '23 results. They are record results. Consolidated second quarter fiscal '23 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group. This arose mainly from continued rebound in demand for commercial aerospace products and services and the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '22 acquisitions. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal '23 each improved by 28% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. These results mainly reflect 10% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth as well as the impact from some acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 24% to $105.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and that was up from $85 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '22. Our total debt to shareholders' equity was 26.4% as of April 30, '23, and this compared to 11% as of October 31, '22. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $627.5 million as of April 30, '23 compared to shareholders' equity ratios was 21.9% as of April 30, '23, and this compared to 5.7% as of October 31, '22. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.4x, less than 1x, as of April 30, '23, and that compared to 0.25x as of -- October 31, '22. Both times were less than 1x EBITDA. The increase in our debt ratio in the first 6 months of fiscal '23 principally reflects the impact from financing the purchase of Exxelia in January '23. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $77.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, and that compared to $96.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The cash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of fiscal '23 reflects an increase in working capital principally driven by an increase in inventory to support our increased consolidated backlog. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '23. As a personal comment, I always consider increase in inventories an indication of future growth in sales, so the increase in the inventory does not concern me. I will now discuss our recent acquisition activity. In March 23, we entered into an exclusive license and acquired certain key assets for the aircraft emergency locator transmitter, or as we call it in the industry, the ELT product line from Honeywell International, and this will fit nicely with the business operations of a subsidiary of the ETG Group. ELTs provide critical emergency transition signals in the event of aircraft impact on land or water to enable first responders to aircraft. We expect this license and asset acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in the year following closing. Earlier this month, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Wencor Group for $1.9 billion in cash and $150 million in HEICO Class A common stock, all to be paid at closing for a total of $2.050 billion in the aggregate. Upon closing, which is expected to occur by the end of calendar '23, Wencor would be HEICO's largest ever acquisition in purchase price as well as in revenue and income acquired. Wencor will become part of HEICO's Flight Support Group. Wencor is a large commercial and military aircraft aftermarket company, offering factory new FAA-approved aircraft replacement parts and value-added distribution of high use commercial and military aftermarket parts and aircraft and engine accessory component repair and overhaul services. Wencor is based in Peachtree, Georgia, and provides its parts and services internationally, employing approximately 1,000 team members in 19 facilities around the United States. HEICO recently entered into the financing arrangements to secure adequate funding for the Wencor acquisition. This acquisition is subject to government approval and customary closing conditions. The highly-synergistic acquisition is expected to be accretive to HEICO's earnings within the following year after closing. This acquisition materially expands HEICO's aftermarket product offerings and will enable the combined company to offer even greater savings and greater capabilities to customers while expanding our new products and services development capacity. Wencor is an ideal and perfect highly-complementary fit with HEICO. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the second quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '23, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the FSG and ETG groups, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher material and labor costs. During fiscal '23, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We believe that our ongoing conservative policies, a strong balance sheet and a high degree of liquidity enables us to continuously invest in new research and development and to take advantage of periodic strategic inventory purchasing opportunity, as well as executing on our successful acquisition program. All these collectively position HEICO for continued growth and market share gains. In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Their persistent drive and determination to win in the marketplace has resulted in another quarter of outstanding results, and we thank you for all that you do to make HEICO a great company. I would now like to open the floor for questions. Rob, this is Larry. As a comment to summarize, we really believe that this combination is a great win for our customers because with expanded capacity and we believe that we'll be able to offer customers better pricing, lower pricing, more products and more efficiency. So we look at it not so much as a win for HEICO and Wencor, which I think it will be, but really a big win for the customers and the industry. As you know, HEICO exists because its pricing is below the OEM, and that's the reason that they buy our products, we're 30%, 40% below. And this will give us the capacity to give even more value. So to answer that question, first of all, I want to emphasize that according to our projections, when we closed this transaction, Wencor, our debt-to-EBITDA will be under 3x. I think the number is 2.8x or 2.7x, Carlos? Net-net will be under 3x. The reason that we insisted upon giving HEICO A shares in the transaction was the purpose to keep the leverage under 3x. HEICO has never been a highly -- as you mentioned, never been a highly leveraged company. Until now, we've never been above 2x. We've been below. Our projections show that within a year, we expect to be slightly below 2x again. So to answer your question, at this point, we are not thinking about becoming a highly leveraged company at 6x or 7x. We felt that taking leverage on at under 3x and being able to reduce it within approximately 1 year below 2x is consistent with our past practices of being very conservative on the leverage side. So the other thing that I want to point out that we don't give guidance, but we do tell the that we project. We try to grow 15% to 20% bottom line on an annual basis in this compound. We have done that pretty consistently for the past 30 years, and according again to our projections, we believe that we will be able to, in '24, grow within that 15% to 20% increase. Now of course, everything is dependent upon market conditions and everything else. But based on everything we know today, this acquisition will permit us to continue to compound at least in '24, and our leverage will be below 2x when we get to the end of '24. So I presume that we will continue to make smaller acquisitions as long as the leverage does not go up. So I don't know, does that answer your question? No, I think two things were happening. Number one, our backlog is larger, and to fill that backlog to supply the customers on time, we have to have inventory. So that went up. Number two, because of supply chain issues, our subsidiaries want to make sure they have inventory on the shelf to meet the customers' demand. So those 2 things increased the inventory. And that was the main increase, I think, in inventory. By the way, Sheila, in past conferences, we have stated that the ETG Group would acquire a strong company that had a lower margin than -- I mean, when ETG was 28% or 33%. We always said, if we bought a company that had close to 20%, it's going to lower the average margin. But the cash and profit generation and the size of the acquisition of Exxelia warranted us saying, fine, we'll lower -- we'll take a lower operating margin because this is a very fine company. And by the way, it has great management, and we believe it has the ability to grow. So those things overrode the desire. It would have been great to have higher margin. We do believe that as we build in some efficiencies, that margin can creep up. Yes. Let me make one comment. Wencor was owned by private equity, and their model is heavy leverage. HEICO, when it closes, will own Wencor and our model is low leverage. So that leverage situation will totally disappear. Yes Eric wants to. No. As -- this is Larry. As you know, the OE generally has a monopoly position in replacement parts. He starts off with offering the only available parts. If they want to replace parts, they have to go to the OE. HEICO has a tiny share because of its PMA, but PMA has succeeded because of its price benefit to the airlines. So we offer a much greater value to the airlines, and that's where our competitive advantage exists. So that -- you know what the marketplace looks like, but we are very small compared to what the market is. And we only -- essentially, we said we only compete with ourselves. So we try to grow the bottom line 15%, 20%, but that's a tiny share of the overall market. First of all, it's a good question. We have known about Wencor for many years. We were aware of it. In previous times, we try to buy it at much lower prices. There was an auction. We were competing with some -- what we consider pretty well-financed private equity groups. We don't feel that we paid a low price. We feel that we -- actually, I feel that I pay a high price, and much higher than we had really wanted to pay. So the auction pushed us up, and we paid what I consider and we consider a market price. Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody who participated on this call, people who asked questions and those who were just listening. I want to remind you that if you do have questions, give us a call. We'll try to respond to them. And unless you have any other comments or questions, I want to again thank the HEICO team members. They are the guys who make it happen and they do a phenomenal job. And we will -- in another 3 months, we will have another third quarter earnings call. Thank you all, and this is the end of our prepared remarks."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 28% to a record $392.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $306.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The net sales increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 reflects robust 20% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 51% to a record $99.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from $66.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The operating income increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin and the impact the amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation expense. The improved gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects higher net sales within our Aftermarket Replacement Parts and Specialty Products product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 25.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23, up from 21.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '22. The operating margin increase in the second quarter of fiscal '23 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and decreased SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the second quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Great. Rob. I would be happy to. We're very, very excited about the Wencor deal because of the complementary nature of the transaction. If you look at their various businesses, their product lines really complement HEICO's very well. HEICO started out over in the PMA area focused on engine parts, Wencor has focused on non-engine parts. HEICO also does non engine parts, but there actually is very little similarity in the product that we do. And as a matter of fact, the HEICO component repair stations purchased all of the Wencor PMAs because HEICO doesn't offer those PMAs. So we're very excited about the complementary nature there. With regard to component repair, Wencor overhauls a lot of components and is in a lot of market niches where HEICO is not in, so we think that that's going to broaden us. And then likewise, in distribution, we focus in different areas. Wencor is, for example, has a very large position over in the bearings area whereas HEICO basically doesn't -- isn't involved in the bearings business. So we think that overall, this is going to permit HEICO to become a more efficient and stronger competitor by giving more products to our customers at lower prices, so we're very excited about it. Absolutely. We feel very, very strongly about that. There's a whole product line that HEICO doesn't offer that we're going to now be able to offer to the airlines, and frankly, give them more choice, greater opportunity, greater savings, and it's really going to work out very well. Also, Wencor's got a whole set of manufacturers that makes product for them, and frankly, a lot of those manufacturers, I think can also make product for HEICO as well and vice versa. So we think it's really going to create a tremendous amount of efficiencies. And sort of lastly, HEICO has focused over the years more on, I would say, the airline market. Yes, we serve independent repair stations and brokers and smaller customers. But Wencor really has a world-class e-commerce system, e-commerce platform, which I think is going to be a really great value to our customers. So I mean, I know that our component repair stations' like buying parts from Wencor, so I think that as we bring the best that both companies have to offer, I think it's really going to be good for our customers. Correct. I would say that it would definitely not go down, and it would probably go up as our -- as we offer -- as we've got a more fulsome product line to offer to our customers. I think that there's going to be additional development opportunities, yes, so we view it very much as additive. And in today's market, obviously, labor is very tight. We've got a great workforce. Wencor has got a great workforce. We share -- our DNA is very, very similar. Companies that view themselves as small compared to the very large companies in the industry, and we're really very much focused on product quality, turn time, service and pricing. And I think that there's -- it's really a great, great marriage. And frankly, something that we've all wanted to do for quite a long time, and I'm just happy that we are able to get it done. Thank you, Rob. And also just to add, the proposal to do this was from the -- from our partners, so this wasn't that HEICO initiated for both. So our partner came to us with the suggestion. We said, sure. If that's what you want to do, we're happy to go ahead and do it. Company is performing extremely well, and we couldn't be happier with it and with our partners over there. So it's I think, as Carlos said, a win-win. And then you also asked with regard to the margin. So post-COVID, HEICO has done very well. I think that we have shown to our customers that we started out as a very small company, and everybody's heard me say this 100 times. When you start out very small, you've got to make sure that you keep your customers happy. It's sort of obvious because if you don't do that, you're out of business. And we -- due to our approach of having inventory, we had inventory on the shelf and when, frankly, others ran out of inventory. And we continue to keep our people. We continue to work with the customers, and we added product lines, we added new parts. And as a result, we're doing really, really well. We also shrunk our footprint a little bit as a result of COVID due to some changes in the market, and I think we've become a lot more efficient. So all of this coming through, I mean, obviously, the $9 million isn't going to repeat. But even if you pull that out, the operating margin was above 23%, which is really very, very good. And again, that's in a period of time where we're making our customers happy and supplying parts to them and expanded product line at very, very competitive prices. So I really have to hand it to our team because frankly, in the corporate office, we just sort of make the acquisitions. But the folks in the field were the ones who figured out how to do this, and the numbers just roll up where they do. We don't tell them where to be. It's just that's what comes out of the machine at the end of the day. So I really have to commend them for this. Larry, thanks. I'd be happy to answer that. The sales -- the organic sales growth has really been, frankly, amazing. In Flight Support, we just had our eighth quarter of organic growth over 20%. So the one thing to have 4 quarters where you bounce back, but it's . And the numbers are, frankly, surprised me to the upside every single quarter, and there's a lot of strength out there. I think that the airlines are getting ready for summer season. They know that it's going to be really tough this summer. Everybody wants to fly, whether it's for leisure or business. And they are very, very conscientious and very focused to make sure that they complete those that fly. And so as a result, they make sure that they've got the inventory. I keep on asking our people, I meet quarterly with our sales leaders and I want to understand where we are. And they just see, frankly, continued strength. So Asia was -- it is the last region, if you will, to recover. A widebody is also the last of the fleet type to recover. But we see added interest in the stuff that we're doing, so we're able to bring on additional principles and develop additional parts and repairs. And I think it just in general, speaks to the market. I mean, ultimately, there will be a slowdown. We can't continue at this pace forever, and -- but I'm still very, very bullish that even when that slowdown or a little [indiscernible], which again, we don't see on the horizon right now. Even after that occurs, we're going to continue to ride right through this just as we had in the past. It's like impossible at a time -- impossible to time these things, and that's why we're so committed to the market. Yes. It's a great question, and something we've been thinking about quite a bit. Wencor is a very, very well-run company, and they've got tremendous asset in their people. So frankly, our plan at the moment is just to acquire it and believe it as a separate stand-alone company for the near term. Let's see what benefits could exist between the 2 companies over time, we'll share best practices and we'll figure out how to serve our customers even better. So I think there's obvious areas where we can help each other continue to grow and improve, but the plan is to believe it is a separate stand-alone company for the moment. Yes, that's also a great question. In terms of scale and getting PMA parts approved, we've got a great track record with the FAA to be able to get parts approved so I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to continue to add to that. Wencor has, as I mentioned earlier, a product line that HEICO doesn't offer so I think that this is going to add to the portfolio. And yes, it will speed up the development because right now, for example, HEICO wants to develop the type of part that we haven't done in the past, whereas Wencor has done that type of part in the past then we would be able, yes, to develop it more quickly. So I think that that's going to be a benefit. Also, when we go to customers, very often, customers ask for a broader product line. And by adding the 2 product lines together, we're going to be able to cover a lot more of the waterfront. And so we're very excited about all the benefits that that's going to bring. And then also, Sheila, to add to that. We are anticipating additional growth in the businesses and in particular, over in the distribution side. Picking up additional principles, additional territories, so we had to grow inventory for that. And then also, I think everybody is pretty aware of the extended lead times in the industry. Product that used to have 4-week, 8-week lead times now can have anywhere from 26 to 52 week lead times. And we want to make sure that we are able to service our customer and we've got the parts on the shelf. And as a matter of fact, the head of our distribution business told me this morning that a very major, major industry player out there who is a very big customer, we've got 98% on-time delivery in a market where we are having the place of the 52-week lead times for the products to which we are distributing to that. So in the -- the way we're able to get 98% of this particular business on time delivery when others are dozens of points below that, is by holding the inventory. So we want to be there for our customers. We've never been cash constrained. We want to make sure that we invest in the right inventory. It doesn't do any good to have the wrong inventory, obviously. But we got the right inventory, we make our principals happy, and we're able to service our customers. So I think that's really why inventory has increased and we think it's the right thing to do. Yes, it's a great question and it's something that we thought quite a bit about. We think that there's a whole set of parts that we just haven't been able to tap as efficiently. And if you look at HEICO's sort of developed a certain skill, engineering skill set to go after the types of parts that HEICO does and Wencor has done the same for the parts that they have done. And by being able to focus in each of those areas, I think there's going to be a lot more that we can do together. A lot of these parts made up, so you can have a complex part next to it. That's a complex part, but the 2, there's certain interaction between them. And so this is really going to help us develop a much fuller product set because we're going to be able. But basically, we'll be able to expand into areas that we haven't done in the past. Well, I sure hope so. We think that there's really been a permanent shift and change in the industry. So we've been out there, both HEICO and Wencor have been out there preaching to the customers for whatever, 50 years about PMA, and it's taking in a certain period of time. But you know the old saying, what is it, that necessity is the motherhood of invention? And so we've been out there with, frankly, as good technical product, if not better. And don't get me wrong, our -- the OEM companies out there supplying the market, they supply very, very fine products. So to supply products that are the same as the OEM is quite a technical challenge. And then frankly, in order to have the products on the shelf, that really takes a tremendous amount of effort. So I think we are in a very, very good position to continue to grow our sales. And we compete with the OEMs, and they are really high-quality, excellent companies and they're really, really tough to compete with because they offer a very broad product set at -- with an outstanding quality. So we think that this is the opportunity to obviously bring multiple products together and be able to compete with the OEMs on a better basis. Also, I have to say, I don't want to mention which ones, but even OEMs have now moved to buying both HEICO and Wencor PMA product because if they don't have the parts on the shelf and they've got to shift even their own repaired units. And again, I don't want to go into which ones or what they are, but they purchase our parts to go ahead and do that, saying we're happy to sell it to them. So I think it's really coming together, and there is what I believe is a permanent market shift in how HEICO and Wencor products are viewed in the marketplace. Yes. Tony, this is Eric. I'd be happy to go ahead and go over that. There's a long list of competitors who supply PMA parts there. And I don't want to call them out by name, but they exist and our customers know who they are and they work with them, and so I think that will continue. Our area really for future acquisitions, I wouldn't say is in the PMA area. Our area for future acquisitions would be -- I want to be careful not to because we welcome our competitors to this call, but we don't want to exactly tell them what we're going to be going out after. But we think that there are a lot of adjacent white spaces in which HEICO does not participate. Many, many. And HEICO is still, even though we've done quite nicely, we're still a very small company and there's so much more to do out there. So I think we're going to grow, we're going to focus in areas that are additive and really broaden our product set so we can bring more -- we can become a more efficient and stronger competitor and be able to bring more products to the marketplace. Yes. And Colin, I mean these are really great questions, and I'm glad you're hitting on them. Both HEICO and Wencor are in the distribution market, and the unique benefits that we bring to our distribution partners is that we're able to -- first of all, we both very much focus on the details. Starting out as small companies, we really focused to make sure that we get maximum benefits to the customers, making sure that they know what's available for [indiscernible] that we get the products sold. But the other area of similarity is both HEICO and Wencor have been able to bring 2 distribution partners the ability to develop additional parts that they don't already offer in their catalog. And I'm glad you're mentioning this, because this is something that we've been thinking about. HEICO, to date, we have distribution partners and we've got the ability to develop certain PMAs and we're known at the airlines for developing those PMAs. But for the existing distribution partners that we've got, there's a whole set of additional parts that Wencor can bring to the HEICO distribution partners and really help them, and likewise, HEICO can bring to the Wencor distribution partners. So I think that this is going to increased competition in the distribution aftermarket and make the products that go into the airlines just being that much bigger, so they're going to be able to save a lot more money on it. So that was on the strategic side. You asked also about financial and the culture side. The businesses, the people are really, really similar. Again, as I said, focused on the detail, focused on quality, making sure that we're out there with the customers, whatever they need, when they need it, we move heavy on earth for them, and that is identical in both HEICO and Wencor. And you're right that the people are the real assets, I mean, that's the most important part of the business by far. And Wencor has been constrained as a result of having -- being private equity owned, and they have been constrained. And I think frankly, HEICO's lower leverage is going to free the Wencor people to be able to go out and sell additional product, take additional inventory positions, call it additional inventory, if that's what makes sense, broadly what they do. And again, that's going to help our customers because the more we sell them by definition, the more they make. I mean we've got, by definition, competition on pretty much every single thing that we offer. And our competitors are these big, huge companies that do a phenomenal job and are really, really hard to compete with. So Wencor, in a sense, has had one hand tied behind its back for the last number of years. And now, we're going to be able to go out and free that hand. And I think it's going to work out really, really well for our customers. And then I think you had some ETG. Carlos or. Yes. We don't know specific shares because it's impossible to get that information. But our competitors, as we've always said, are the OEMs. And when you look at the OEM aftermarket sales, I mean, we are -- we've always said that we are absolutely tiny, tiny compared to them. So this is going to give us the ability to compete better with the OEMs. So we still view our market share as very small. We think the product into which we can grow is very, very considerable, so that's why we're very optimistic for the future and why we think that there is really a lot of opportunity here. No. I mean, look, we study everything, but the -- as I've always said, and I've been asked on these calls for 20 years about what are the factors in the marketplace that affect us the most, and it's always been the OEMs. It's always been. I mean the OEMs, they have the home field advantage, they're selling the original product. They're in there. They got point of sale ability. When they sell the asset, they're able to tie up the maintenance long term. They offer a full product set. That's always been our competition. So my -- I mean, if you had to pin me down and get what our market share, the combined market share against aftermarket parts, I guess it's in the 2% area. I mean, it's very, very small, and that's what I think there is a lot of opportunity to really grow. And frankly, look, it's 2%. We're never going to be -- we're never going to have the sales of some of these very large companies. But I think we can continue to grow our product line and be able to offer more product at very good prices to our customers and save them a lot of money. I mean, the airlines are saving a fortunate as the result of our products. And if they're able to do that and we're at 2%, I think they'll be able to save even more as we move forward here. In general, I would say that in the past, if Wencor already had a part, HEICO would not develop the part. So they really sort of play, if you will, very much in 2 sandboxes. So we think that we're really going to be able to get best of breed here, whereby each business can focus on what it does exceptionally well. And also, there's a lot of engineering and technical tools that each company uses, frankly, that can improve the process of the other company as well. And I think all of this put together is just going to benefit the customer with a broader product set in going into areas where we -- where we haven't gone into in the past. I'm reluctant, as you can imagine, Louis, to get into specificity because we don't want to tip people off as to where we're going. But we think that there's a lot of stuff to be developed where no alternative exists now, and we're going to be able to go that stuff. Yes. So I mean look, obviously, we always try to do right by HEICO shareholders so we want to pay a most reasonable price possible. It was very competitive. There was a lot of interest in the company, and we think that it was a fair price for this business. I mean, it's a large business. It's a large asset. It's much bigger than anything we bought in terms of earnings or people, revenue. So I think overall, it's a fair price for -- it's a very fair price for the business, and we're really excited going forward. There is, as we said, great opportunities for our customers. So overall, we think it's going to work out very well. Yes, they -- look, all the businesses had very similar organic growth between parts and distribution, specialty products and the repair. So I mean, they were all in sort of similar areas. Some parts of the business have higher margins than other parts of the business, but overall, we're pleased with the development in each. We think that specialty products, there's still plenty of tailwind to cover because the OE cycle has not fully recovered. And we think that we are, frankly, best of breed in what we do over in the specialty products area. And I think that there is a lot of opportunity, a lot of opportunity for us here to continue to grow and do well and as the business -- as the industry recovers. And also, when you specifically talk about specialty products, Wencor doesn't have a manufacturing capability, or relatively minimal. And this is one of the other very complementary features of the deal because we've got some really outstanding, truly, truly best-in-class manufacturing capabilities within our Specialty Products group. So while Wencor will continue to be loyal to its existing suppliers as we develop additional product going forward, I think that there's going to be a very, very good capability for Wencor to use some of the HEICO Specialty Products businesses as manufacturers. And also, we'll be able to create some redundancy so we don't just have single sources for some of these products. We're really good at this machining, sheet metal fabrication and composites, various stuff that we do. And I think that that's going to provide opportunities for Wencor to grow their product set to get into areas where perhaps traditionally, they have gotten into because they didn't have a supplier to be able to make something which is somewhat similar to what they've done, but different. So I think Specialty Products is going to be a great asset for the combined company going forward. Yes. We look at the sales. And I mean, obviously, in Asia, things have not fully recovered, and likewise in South America. I think that there continues to be opportunity, if you will, recovery coming out of COVID. Frankly, in our other markets, we're way ahead of where we used to be where we were pre-COVID, and we're doing extraordinarily well. And I think, again, that's a result of just being able to sell more stuff. So I think that there's added recovery opportunity. In particular -- and I think everybody is aware of the widebody in Asia. I mean, that's the last thing to come back, and so there's a very good opportunity there."

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law. I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Samara, and thank you all on this call. Good morning to everyone and we thank you again for joining us. Welcome you to this HEICO first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another very strong quarter. The growth and profitability of our operating companies continues to exceed my expectations. It's the people at our companies that make us exceptional and produce these outstanding results. Again thank you for another record-breaking quarter, and I continue to be optimistic that our growth will continue throughout fiscal 2023 and beyond. Summarizing the highlights of our first quarter fiscal 2023 record results. Consolidated first quarter fiscal 2023 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued rebound in the demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 improved 31% and 27%, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These results mainly reflect 14% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the impact from our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions. Consolidated operating margin improved to 20.8% and in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and that was up from 20.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Consolidated net income increased 7% to $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and that was up from $86.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. It should be noted that net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, were both favorably impacted by a discrete net income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net of control \u2013 non-controlling interest was $6.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, down from $17.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This information should be considered when analyzing the results, the comparative results between fiscal 2022 and 2023. In addition, the company incurred $5.1 million of acquisition costs related to the closing the Exxelia International acquisition in January 2023. And that decreased net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by approximately $4.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share. In my opinion, that should also be considered when analyzing the results of our first quarter. The comparatively lower tax benefit from stock option exercises and the onetime Exxelia acquisition costs reduced our diluted earnings by approximately $0.11. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $640.2 million as of January 31, 2023 compared to shareholders' equity, was 23.3% as of January 31, 2023 and that compared to \u2013 sorry, 5.7% as of October 31, 2022. Obviously, the increase was the debt that we incurred to acquire Exxelia. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.02 times as of January 31, 2023, and that compared to 0.25 times as of October 2022, still a very, very low debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The increase in our net debt ratios in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflect the impact again from the purchase of Exxelia in January 2023 and that was HEICO's largest ever acquisition in terms of purchase price. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and that compared to $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The cash flow provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support our increased consolidated backlog we continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal 2023. In January 2023, we increased our regular semiannual cash dividend by 11% to $0.10 per share. This represented our 89th consecutive semiannual cash dividend, which we have paid since 1979. Let me now discuss our recent acquisition activity. As mentioned previously, in January 2023, we acquired Exxelia International, our largest ever in terms of purchase price and revenue. We are excited about the European defense and aerospace opportunities, which Exxelia brings to HEICO, and we look forward to supporting their continued growth plans. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to HEICO's earnings per share within the first year of the transaction closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the first quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 36% to a record $371.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $272.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflects strong 25% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 60% to a record $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $52.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. The improved gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and specialty products product lines and the impact of lower inventory obsolescence expenses primarily due to increased demand. The Fly Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 up from 19.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The operating margin increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and decreased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies to discuss the first quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 15% to $255.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $222.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions. The Electronic Technologies Group's organic net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were consistent with the prior year and principally reflected increased other electronics, commercial aviation and medical products net sales offset by decreased defense products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 2% to $56.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $55.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by higher acquisition costs and fees related to the Exxelia acquisition and a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects decreased net sales of defense products, partially offset by increased net sales of our other electronics and commercial aviation products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to 25% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The lower operating margin principally reflects the Exxelia acquisition costs, along with the lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Although as we anticipated, our defense net sales have been lower, the ETG's backlog remains at record levels, even factoring out Exxelia. Each ETG subsidiary is a unique business with unique drivers, but they are supplying mission-critical, high-reliability or harsh environment products which are required for their customers' products to operate. This remains a very positive dynamic and materially explains our strong backlog and our confidence going forward. While I don't have a crystal ball, as I previously mentioned, we expect our commercial aviation demand to remain strong this year and beyond, and the defense sales should strengthen in the later part of this year or even early next year, as higher defense budgets and defense spending kicks in. We also expect that our high-end other non-aerospace and defense markets, which have been very strong and continue to report record sales will become softer ahead due to what at least I believe, will be a reversion to normal ordering patterns by manufacturers as general supply chain conditions ameliorate. Hopefully, this coincides with the defense upturn though we can't be certain on the timing of each. Consistent with what we've often said and our experience over literally decades we believe the ETG should be a mid- to low single-digit organic sales grower over time with meaningful variations on that growth rate during individual quarters. This has been the ETG pattern since the business was formed in 1996. When asked on these calls what I believe our operating margins will be. You've heard me remark that I felt our cash margin which is the operating margin before acquisition accounting, which is the true economic margin business realizes would stay within the ranges we are now seeing obviously before considering the impact from future and unknown acquisitions. Keeping in mind that our noncash amortization expense is around 500 basis points. And that we had meaningful transaction expenses in the quarter from the Exxelia acquisition, which trimmed our operating margin by another couple of hundred basis points. Our companies continue to report excellent margins in the expected range. I'm often asked what impact Exxelia, which is a strong margin business, but has lower margins than our overall average should have an overall ETG margins, I would say it will probably be around 200, will probably trim around 200 basis points of consolidated margins going forward. before, of course, taking into effect any future and unknown acquisitions, still great margins overall. As we anticipated in our last conference call and other settings, our business has made material progress reducing supply chain delays, which we expect to continue, though unevenly throughout the year. By the way, in the first quarter, we roughly estimate that somewhere around a little shy of $30 million of shipments were delayed mostly into our second quarter versus over $40 million of delays during fiscal 2022's fourth quarter. Overall, we remain very excited about the ETG's prospects over time and are thrilled to have the irreplaceable set of businesses we operate in this group with strong margins and reasonable growth prospects. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. And as for the outlook, we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023 and continue to anticipate net sales growth in both Flight Support and ETG, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly to higher material and labor costs. During fiscal 2023, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. The remainder of fiscal 2023 looks promising, and I believe our unique culture of ownership and entrepreneurial spirit will continue to provide for outstanding operating results for our shareholders. Thank you all for what you do to make HEICO a great company. And with that, I would like to open the floor and the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Deuschle: Eric, have you been able to work with your airline customers to reopen any of your aftermarket LTAs to get some price increases through early? Or have the airlines generally not been willing to do that?\nEric Mendelson: Hi Scott, yes, we\u2019ve been able to get price increases. Our LTAs do permit us to adjust price, although typically, it\u2019s capped at various levels, depending on the level of business that the customers have with us. But yes, we\u2019ve been successful in getting priced from our LTA customers as well as our non-LTA customers.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then Victor, on the Defense OE side, I think some of your peers are exposed to four to five-year LTAs with basically little to no inflation protection at all, and that\u2019s causing them to underearn relative to what their businesses are capable of. So I guess I was curious if that\u2019s been a constraint on profitability for you at all as well? And just any detail you can offer on exposure to LTAs on the defense side of the business.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Generally speaking, we don\u2019t have a four and five-year pricing locked in on those LTAs. But there definitely is a lag effect on pricing \u2013 price adjustments, right? We generally don\u2019t have orders of less than a year. So usually, that takes some time to filter through. We\u2019ve been pretty successful offsetting it over time. Almost all our companies feel that we will offset the inflationary effects. But there can be a delay in, let\u2019s say, six months or a year, we do have some longer-term pricing locked in, in some instances.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. And then last question for me, Carlos, maybe you can just say what the ETG backlog was in the quarter and maybe how that\u2019s trended relative to the last year or whatever it compares most useful. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. The \u2013 if you look at the backlog compared between Q1 2023 and Q1 2022, it is up, it\u2019s about $856 million roughly for the end of Q1 2023 which, by the way is pretty consistent with Q4\u2019s backlog, which was elevated, but it is substantially larger than it was in Q1 2022, which is around $660 million.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Thank you, everyone.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Arnett with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arnett: Hey, good morning, Larry. Thank you, Carlos, Eric\u2026\nCarlos Macau: Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nPeter Arnett: Hey, another strong quarter for margins in the second quarter where we\u2019ve seen margins above 22%, and you\u2019ve given a lot of reasons to the efficiencies. But I guess maybe just kind of talking on Scott\u2019s question on just your ability to pass on some price. How are you thinking about just this level of margins going forward? Any color there would be helpful.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to treat our customers well, as I\u2019ve said for the last year or so, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we maintain our margins in this inflationary environment, both materials and labor are increasing in cost. And we need to make sure that we pass along that cost plus we\u2019re able to get a reasonable margin on top of it. So I think the numbers can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on mix. But I think we\u2019re in a pretty good area and where \u2013 we like where we are. We have not received a lot of price in these margins. We\u2019ve received some. And I think there\u2019s an opportunity to get some more. But of course, as we replace inventories, inventory costs will be going up. So I\u2019m reluctant to predict or to forecast the change in margins. I think that this is really a reasonable level. And we run the business very much as in the viewpoint of what\u2019s right for our customers and what\u2019s right for the business and the margin just sort of falls out of the end. So I don\u2019t have a way to tell what it\u2019s going to be, but I do feel that these are reasonable numbers going forward.\nPeter Arnett: Yes. I appreciate that. And Eric, have you seen any pickup in kind of the wide-body mix yet? And obviously, we\u2019ve seen wide-body traffic starting to materially pick up globally.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we\u2019ve seen some pickup in wide-body, yes. And everybody anticipates continued strengthening in those markets.\nPeter Arnett: Okay. And just one last one, Carlos, on the net leverage kind of jumping up following facility deal. Any thoughts on just deleveraging or where your comfort level is if more M&A is going to be achieved this year. Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: Well, we have a pretty full pipeline on M&A, and we\u2019re going to do all the deals that make sense for our shareholders. So if we find transactions that make sense for the company and the shareholders, we\u2019ll find a way to do it. We\u2019ve never really been concerned about a leverage number too much. I think Larry said in the past that we would take on substantial leverage for the fit \u2013 hike we just haven\u2019t found that animal yet. I mean right now at 1 times levered, I feel like we\u2019re under levered and I\u2019d love nothing more than to find more opportunities to get that leverage number up. However, I do think our culture and our pattern of operations suggests that if we do borrow, we make a hell of an effort to delever quickly. And so as we move forward, outside of use of cash for, let\u2019s say, acquisitions, CapEx and things like that, we will be looking to reduce our credit exposure so that we can reload on other deals as they come in front of us.\nPeter Arnett: Appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLarry Solow: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Congrats on our really good quarter especially\u2026\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nLarry Solow: Great quarter, especially with these adjustments. I guess, Eric, a couple of questions for you first. So the FSG organic revenue growth, 23% this quarter. And I think if you look back last year, I think in Q1, it was somewhere \u2013 I think it was close to 30%. So obviously, last year was a little bit of easier comp, this year was not. How do you \u2013 you see ordering patterns and stuff? It feels like are they still building back inventory? Or is this all new sales for you? Just trying to get a little grasp on really an amazing quarter. And pretty considerable outperformance compared to where we were on the top line.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Larry.\nLarry Solow: Good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we\u2019re very pleased with the numbers. Actually, our first quarter 2022 organic growth, I think, was 30%. So now we\u2019ve done 25% on top of 30%, which is really quite outstanding. And it\u2019s, frankly, far more than we had internally predicted. Our businesses continue to do very well. And I\u2019ve spoken with our salespeople over the last couple of weeks to understand our sales leadership to understand what\u2019s going on. And they anticipate basically continued strength in the business. I\u2019m reluctant to anticipate growth beyond the level where we are. I mean, we grew 7% from the fourth quarter, just the quarter-on-quarter number top line. I think that we\u2019re running at a really solid rate. And I want to see a few more quarters to really understand where we are. None of our customers and our salespeople do not believe that the airlines are overstocking. But as I\u2019ve cautioned everybody over the last number of quarters, every downturn, of course, is followed by a recovery and every recovery is followed by a slight overshoot. And I specifically asked this question to our sales leaders, are we in \u2013 do we have any indication that we\u2019re in the overshoot area? And the answer is no. Nobody thinks that we\u2019re in the overshoot area. So I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. The numbers are incredible. They\u2019re phenomenal. I think we\u2019re capturing market share, and this is unique to HEICO. We\u2019ve \u2013 we speak to our customers, and we see what\u2019s going on with other suppliers. And we think that, frankly, the performance at HEICO is really with regard to the aftermarket is industry-leading, and we\u2019re outperforming others. And that\u2019s as a result of being able to hold inventory, treating our customers, right, not jamming them with price increases, making sure that they get value. So I feel very good about where we are.\nLarry Solow: And I know we\u2019ve asked questions on the margins the last several quarters, they\u2019ve been kind of running a little bit above that sort of 2021 historical range. Has the mix changed at all over the last few years that could maybe help that margin or not particularly?\nEric Mendelson: Not particularly. Not particularly. As a matter of fact, we\u2019ve had a little bit more intangible amortization. So that would have as a result of the acquisition. So that would have decreased the margins. So no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a mix thing. I think we\u2019re just very efficient. We\u2019ve got a great team. The thing that\u2019s interesting is I think that these margins are a result of, frankly, what we did a decade and two decades ago. They\u2019re not as a result of what we\u2019ve done in the last year or two. When you treat your customers, right, you treat your people, right? You get into a virtuous cycle, and I think that\u2019s very much where we are. And I think we\u2019re reaping the benefits of the long-term the culture that we put into place over 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving these numbers. We have the parts when other people did. We continue to develop a lot of new PMAs and other products through the downturn. We continue to take inventory. We did all of the right things, and that\u2019s why these numbers are coming out and frankly, even surprising us.\nLarry Solow: Got you. And then just one quick follow-up for Carlos, just on the \u2013 a little bit of a higher tax rate this quarter. I know a little bit less stock option credit for you guys. Has your full year outlook at all changed? I don\u2019t know if you commented \u2013 I was going to do on the call for a couple of minutes. Has your full year outlook changed at all from the tax rate?\nCarlos Macau: No, it really hasn\u2019t. The fourth quarter tax rate was substantially larger this quarter than Q1 of 2022, which the reason Larry mentioned is the lower benefit from tax stock option, the tax benefits that we experienced. If you look at the rate, it\u2019s 100% of the increase is due to that. I think for the year, we should fall out between 20% and 21%, kind of where we fell last year. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll wind up this year.\nLarry Solow: Got you. Appreciate all the color. Thanks guys.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Osterland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPete Osterland: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions today. First, I just wanted to ask, within the Flight Support Group, what are you seeing for product demand in the Chinese market? Has there been any choppiness as a result of their emergence from the pandemic lockdowns? And are you seeing any potential that sales into that market could be a strong tailwind for FSG sales over the rest of the fiscal year?\nEric Mendelson: Hi. This is Eric. Good morning. Yes, we\u2019re doing quite nicely in the Chinese market. I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 we tend to be \u2013 I tend to not like to get into a lot of detail on specific customers or markets for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that we\u2019re doing very well. We\u2019ve got a very good presence there, and I think we are well positioned to pick up market share and to continue to grow that market as it recovers. Frankly, our sales there have really been outstanding over the last year in excess of what we had predicted and frankly, where we were in 2019. And I think we\u2019ll continue to benefit as that market recovers.\nPete Osterland: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then I had one for Carlos. Could you provide an estimate for what you expect interest expense to be for the year? Is the first quarter level a good run rate to use? Or just any help you could get there?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I think our interest right now is running close to 6% on our debt. It\u2019s variable. We just borrowed $0.5 billion for Exxelia. So I haven\u2019t really given a forecast on that. But if you take our outstandings, it\u2019s going to be somewhere at $10 million. If you\u2019re thinking about a run rate, it could be around $10 million a quarter, something like that.\nPete Osterland: Appreciate the help. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey guys. Following up on some of the questions on leverage. Laurans, you said that you\u2019ve got a busy pipeline for acquisitions. So how should we think about how you finance this? I mean the business is under levered and also you guys use the Class A stock to finance acquisitions before, how do we think about the balance of financing for those incremental portions? And you guys have historically run a very underlevered book. But what would be the peak leverage you\u2019re willing to consider if the deals are available and accretive?\nLaurans Mendelson: Do you want to answer? Basically, we will continue right now to use our credit line, which we\u2019re underdrawn on that credit line. We have \u2013 we can go to $1.5 billion, and we have facility to go to $1.850 billion. And we\u2019re right now what Carlos $650 million or something like that.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, around $700 million.\nLaurans Mendelson: $700 million. So we have plenty of room on that. In the event that we were to consider something larger, we have spoken to our banks and the banks are fully supportive of going much further if we would like to. At the moment, we have no request into them to do that. But we\u2019ve always spoken with them and said, in the event that we need additional funds, we can do that. As for issuing HEICO Class A stock and an acquisition. We normally don\u2019t do that because we find that because of our strong cash flow, we\u2019d rather pay cash and reduce the debt balance quickly. As Carlos said earlier, we would increase the leverage amounts as long as we could bring them down to a much more manageable amount, which I consider in the area of 2x to 3x EBITDA \u2013 at 2x to 3x. We\u2019ve never been at 2x EBITDA. We\u2019ve always been below. And we will continue to be a low-levered company. We never intend to go as some companies go to 5x, 6x, 7x. We do not do that. Does that answer your question?\nKristine Liwag: Yes, that\u2019s great. Very helpful. Thank you. And if I could ask another question. During COVID, airlines were a lot more cost conscious and PMAs were a priority for them. Now that we\u2019ve seen air traffic continue to be strong and sustained, we are seeing that globally. Can you talk about where PMA is in terms of your airline customers\u2019 priorities? And if you could provide some information regarding how your market share evolved maybe for your top 10 customers and the use of PMA that would be most appreciated.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to do that. A couple of things. Of course, actually, they\u2019re interesting during the pandemic, actually, customers were so \u2013 see problems that I don\u2019t know that they were approving many alternative parts at that moment. However, we were very confident that we would ultimately get those parts approved. So we continue to develop, continue to manufacture them through the pandemic. So when the pandemic got to the end, we started getting a lot of parts approved. We hear from our customers that, that is not a PMA item; it\u2019s really a HEICO specific item. HEICO developed these parts, HEICO developed these repairs. And I think that our growth is really unique for the industry. So I\u2019d be very careful. And I would not describe it as a broad interest in PMA. I think this is specifically a broad interest in HEICO. As we\u2019ve gotten larger, we\u2019re a $20 billion market cap company. We\u2019ve got deep technology and strong financial ability and our customers see that. And I think we\u2019ve been rewarded with a unique opportunity right now. So \u2013 but as far as HEICO goes, we continue to develop a lot of parts and repairs. We\u2019ve got a lot in progress. Our distribution businesses are doing very well in taking market share from others. So I anticipate continued growth, certainly over the numbers that we did last year. Again, our first quarter numbers were, frankly, so out of the park that I\u2019m reluctant to predict increases off of those for the next couple of quarters, and we like to mature at this level. First, I\u2019m not saying that we won\u2019t, but \u2013 and frankly, when we did our fourth quarter call two months ago, I had no belief that we would be hitting these numbers that we\u2019re hitting now. So, I prefer to be a little bit conservative going forward, but I do anticipate continued growth off of last year.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thanks, Eric, and thanks everyone.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you, good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Eric, just on your last point, FSG sales are 8% above 2019 levels. I\u2019m guessing that has minimal gross price in there. So to your market share point, where do you think you\u2019re gaining share? Is it just additional products, additional customers on the same product? Are you coming out with more products because customers are demanding it? Is it regional growth? Can you talk a little bit about that? And I appreciate the earlier color.\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 good morning, Sheila and thanks for your question. I would say it is a strength across the board. We are getting significant sales of parts to customers who had not purchased those customers \u2013 not purchased those parts before. So, I anticipate continued increase there. Normally, when a customer switches to us, they buy all of their demand from us. So yes, part of it is we\u2019re seeing their own recovery and the volumes are increasing. But also a large part of it is we\u2019re doing very well and coming out with new products and getting those products sold. And then, of course, the flow-through between PMA and distribution has been very strong, and we\u2019ve been helping our distribution principles of pain PMAs and we sell those parts as well. And that\u2019s worked out very well. So it\u2019s really broad-based strength. We still have \u2013 as far as geographies, we still have recovery opportunity, I would say, primarily in Asia as a result of the \u2013 those markets are still lagging, as you know, from your weekly report. So, I think that there\u2019s continued opportunity there. But yes, we are \u2013 we\u2019re past our 2019 numbers and really very, very happy about that.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. I have one for Victor and one for Carlos. So Victor, in terms of Exxelia, we\u2019re calculating about from one month of contribution, 50 basis points of dilution and then margins are still down 40 bps year-over-year outside of Exxelia. So can you kind of talk about what the mix impact specifically is? Is it just more of the specialty products that are nondefense? And how long you think that will continue?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure, Sheila. I think I assume those numbers include the dilution from the transaction expenses. So those are nonrecurring expenses, and that was \u2013 that probably accounted for a very good portion of that in the quarter. But the mix Exxelia is majority aerospace and defense. And then they have a variety of other markets. Some of it is energy. Some of it is clean energy. Some of it is transportation, trains, for example, and other electrification initiatives. So it\u2019s a pretty broad product base. And just across the board, their margins are generally lower than our margins. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that over time those move up. I don\u2019t want to make a prediction as to that. I think it\u2019s a little too early to do that, but they certainly are margin-focused and their margins have been on an upward trend over the last, I don\u2019t know, four, five years. So we like that as well.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. And then, Carlos, last one for you. Inventory was the use of cash in the quarter, about $52 million, following $89 million in fiscal 2022, which is pretty unusual for you guys. So how do we kind of think about that unwinding?\nCarlos Macau: That\u2019s a good question, Sheila. We knew that we would have a spend this quarter. The spend this quarter was rather concentrated rate of that $52 million, roughly $30 million that was related to distribution buys that relate to certain contracts that either renewed or renew. And so we have \u2013 we do have some bulking up in that area. \u2013 if you pull the $30 million out, it\u2019s $20 million worth of inventory spend, yes, that probably felt about right just for supporting our backlog. I don\u2019t anticipate huge investment in inventory like we had last year. In fact, with interest rates going up, I\u2019ve encouraged the subs to be smart on that. But I\u2019ve also told them that if they have customer demand, we don\u2019t want them to be in a situation where they don\u2019t have product to support the customers. So it\u2019s a delicate balance. But I don\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll see us have the same level of investment for the full year this year as we did last year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Sheila.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes, hi, good morning. Maybe a first question for Victor or Carlos. It sounds like, Victor, the commentary on sort of the pace of recovery of supply chain in your defense markets, in particular, maybe a little slower than expected do you still see sort of full year ETG organic growth up low to mid-single this year? And how does that recovery look in terms of the top line for the segment over the next few quarters?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I would \u2013 this is Victor. I would think that\u2019s probably right, low to mid single digits organic growth. I think it\u2019s a little early to tell with certainty. I mean again, when the defense budget \u2013 defense recovery moves in for us is really a little bit up in the air. Not that it\u2019s been bad by the way. I mean, our businesses are doing well in absolute terms. But I would expect that and later this year, possibly into next year, we would see it. I mean, I just \u2013 on timing, I just don\u2019t know. Supply chain by the way for us, from our vendors like I think a lot of other people, still not easy. But as I mentioned in my comments definitely improving. And our companies kind of across the board are saying either it\u2019s improving or at least not deteriorating. So that\u2019s a good sign.\nKen Herbert: Okay. And even when I do the add backs for the ETG margins, it still seems like it\u2019s obviously a little bit lower than it\u2019s been. Was there anything structurally different in the segment or maybe higher costs associated with maybe some investments in prebuys [ph]? Or how should we think about sort of the core ETG margins, obviously excluding the amortization and of course the Exxelia impact?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure, and that\u2019s what I was alluding to in my remarks is that over time people have said to me, look, on these calls in particular, where do you think the margins are going to be. And I would say, listen, I don\u2019t know exactly. But I then give you kind of think of where we are \u2013 where we were, which is kind of the origin of the cash margin, right? Low 30s, 32%, 31%, 33%, bouncing around in that range. And I\u2019ve always said, listen, I think within 10% of that is probably reasonable, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re finding ourselves more or less before transaction expenses, et cetera. So I do think that\u2019s reasonable and that is mix sensitive. I mean, that is definitely mix sensitive. In defense, we have some higher margin products of which we\u2019re selling less right now. And that tends to shift over time. But it\u2019s definitely mix sensitive.\nCarlos Macau: Ken, this is Carlos. Just to be clear because we didn\u2019t include this in the $5.1 million. If you add in to the ETG margin, if you add in the $5.1 million and then throw another $1 million in there for amortization costs related to the deal that\u2019s new. You get back to a margin that\u2019s very similar to what we had last year to what Victor was trying \u2013 was pointing out.\nKen Herbert: Perfect. Thanks, Carlos. Appreciate the color.\nCarlos Macau: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thank you. Good morning, guys.\nVictor Mendelson: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I just first follow-up on Carlos\u2019 last point of clarification. So in terms of onetime items at ETG in the quarter, was it the 5.1 million plus 1 [ph] million of amortization or was it were there other things related to the Exxelia transaction that flowed through there?\nCarlos Macau: So the one time stuff was $5.1 million, and what I was pointing out was that we took on some additional amortization for the month of January. It was close to $1 million. And that relates to new amortization. It has things in there such as inventory write-ups, purchase accounting amortization. So there\u2019s an element of that is kind of short term. The inventory write-up only lasts for a quarter and a half or something like that or a couple quarters. So there\u2019s an element of that additional $1 million, which it\u2019s not really a one-time cost. We\u2019re going to have the amortization going forward. But what the point I was trying to make was that if you kind of factor all that stuff in, the ETG is running around a 25% operating margin, which is what we posted last year at this time. That was the point of that statement.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Okay. No, that helps. Thank you. I was also curious, on supply chain, we often hear about ETG having some challenges in the supply chain. Is flight support also seen supply chain challenges? And if so, kind of what is the past dues there if any?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we \u2013 hi, Gautam. This is Eric. Yes, we definitely have seen supply chain challenges within FSG. Frankly, our sales and earnings would be even higher. If we got all these parts in which we\u2019re not able to get at the moment. Look, I think we\u2019re doing better than most, and that\u2019s as a result of our decentralized structure. We don\u2019t do Soviet Central planning at HEICO. We let the businesses figure out what they need. They stay very close to their customers. That\u2019s how everything is designed. And as a result, I think we were ahead of the curve and you saw our inventories go up a year ago, and now you\u2019ve seen the results of having that inventory on the shelf. And now our inventories are up again and we\u2019re going to be in position to be able to support our customers is this level of sales hopefully continues to go up. But yes, we are definitely seeing the same supply chain challenges around materials and in particular labor at our suppliers. There were aerospace products are made in relatively small quantities for the aftermarket. And you'd be surprised how many manufacturers around the world and very high quality, good manufacturers had people retire and they sort of, if you will loss the recipe on how to do certain processes; and I'm talking major companies. So they've struggled getting people trained to be able to replicate those processes. And often, they make parts that have not been acceptable. So, but I think things are definitely getting better in that regard.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then just Victor, if you don't mind, maybe also just elaborating on how the supply chain has improved and where maybe incrementally things got worse, if any? Just curious where you're seeing the bottlenecks still.\nVictor Mendelson: I mean \u2013 thank you. This is, it's still on the component side. And our businesses by so many different components, subcomponents plus raw materials, things like metals and silicones and so on. Those have been easier for us, but it's generally on the electronic component side, I mean, an area that remains difficult, I think for everybody in the industry. Certain items, things like FPGAs, there are some other parts and components. I'm aware of where some vendors are slipping. I'd rather not call them out publicly on this and where they keep falling short rather consistently where we have effectively sole-source situations and it's hard to dual source and things of that nature. But it is \u2013 our company is \u2013 about close to half of our companies report to us that it's improving more than half at least static or improving, and it's the minority who see it small minority going the other way. So that's what I say. I think we'll continue to make progress. It will be uneven on it one quarter forward, maybe next one a little bit backward, but generally in the right direction. I think that's probably because people in the manufacturing chain generally, companies in the manufacturers generally have gone out and put more on the shelves. And I think there's going to be a reversion to the mean. And that will happen over some period of time, whether it's a year or six or nine months or I don't exactly know.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nJosh Sullivan: Hi. Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: On your PMA HEICO customers, given that the value of the parts offer, and you talked about how customers switch over to the entire HEICO portfolio when they realize the value. But is this impacting airline long-term aircraft fleet planning decisions at all? Are you seeing any data that suggests because HEICO's PMA's legacy aircraft can be kept profitable for longer, maybe delaying any retirement decisions?\nEric Mendelson: We have heard at various places that, that is a consideration. I don't know if that's also partly designed to get us to manufacture more products for our customers. But yes, we can have a considerable impact on the cost of operation of older equipment. And when our customers commit to us long-term and we give them pricing protection, we can get into an area where our parts can be as much as 70% below the OEM after many years, and we still drive very nice margins and the airlines save a lot of money. So I do think it's a factor, but I think the larger factor is the overall cost of the aircraft, what they want to do in terms of reliability, fleet simplification, all of that stuff. But there's no question that we are a major cost driver for them, especially as the aircraft get old.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take the next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Good morning, guys.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning.\nCarlos Macau: Good morning.\nLouis Raffetto: Eric, I guess you called out the 23% organic growth for commercial aero. So I guess defense is up even more. Can you just sort of differentiate your defense end market versus that in ETG?\nEric Mendelson: So the defense market that we've got, let's see, the, yes. The defense market was up a greater percentage. We do have a lot of components on \u2013 in the missile defense area, and we're particularly strong there. Look, it can bounce around year-over-year. I'm very pleased with the numbers. We've made a big push into defense, and we're doing very nicely. I would say the big difference, Louis, is that the Flight Support defense stuff in general doesn't have the same supply constraints with regard to certain electronics that ETG has. ETG is get more susceptible to the chip issues. And over on the flight support side, we don't have a lot of that. So that's really the main driver there. \nLouis Raffetto: That's great color. It's glad to hear. I know Defense has been an area that's probably say underwhelmed, but it's been a big opportunity. So it's good to hear that you're making some headway there. \nEric Mendelson: Yes. It is a huge opportunity, and we have a big focus in that area. \nLouis Raffetto: Great. Carlos, just back to the backlog in ETG. I think you said $856 million, so that's up $150 million or so from last quarter. Is that the bulk of that from Exxelia or just trying to gauge the $856 million from the $660 million and again, a little over $700 million through the year. \nCarlos Macau: Yes. So if you're looking at Q4 backlog, yes, a lot of \u2013 the majority of \u2013 not all of it, but the majority of it is Exxelia adding on that we picked up in January. \nLouis Raffetto: And then just one more on the, there was a small change in the accrued contingency in the quarter. Just which segment that impacted? Was that sort of another headwind within ETG? Or was that an FSG?\nCarlos Macau: That was a combination of discount rates and FX, which broadly affected both segments. \nLouis Raffetto: All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks Buddy. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Just a couple of questions for you. One thing we've been hearing is that some of the suppliers when you go down into the lower tiers of the supply chain or suffering from working capital needs and other balance sheets are kind of maybe upside down because of making investments before the pandemic and then things are not playing out that aggravated by the 737 situation. Has that created any opportunities for you all from an M&A perspective to maybe pick up some interesting, albeit smaller companies that would be available today that might not have been before?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Ron, this is Eric. Yes, I would say that there has been some opportunity in that area. But normally that's sort of not the area, the folks who are having those issues, in general, are not the companies that we're working with. So I don't anticipate it at this point, being a huge opportunity for us. I mean, frankly, the large companies have to make sure paid as they have been getting paid earlier from the government that they take care of their supply base. And I think those companies are more in that general realm. So it's not as applicable to us to the kind of revenues.\nRon Epstein: Got it. And then if we think about the PMA \u2013 maybe just following up on question said earlier, the global fleet kind of debt went two years older when sort of everything was in a coma because of the pandemic. So you've got a fleet that's two years older. You've got aircraft that are that much closer to a de-check. They might not be on long-term maintenance contracts anymore. They might be out of warranty. Are you seeing a pickup in demand for your products for like a third de-check on some of these aircraft?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think I don't have specific information on that. But yes, I do believe that we are selling parts for checks that had not been anticipated. I don't think it's a large part of our sales. But yes, I am aware that we are benefiting from that.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it appears there are no additional questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you. Again, this is Larry Mendelson, and I want to thank everybody on this call for your interest in HEICO. If you do have questions, we are available, Eric, Victor, myself, Carlos, so you can give us a call or e-mail. And we look forward to speaking to you at the Q2 earnings call, which will be in about three months from now. So have a good day, you all, and we'll speak to you soon.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure. The \u2013 if you look at the backlog compared between Q1 2023 and Q1 2022, it is up, it's about $856 million roughly for the end of Q1 2023 which, by the way is pretty consistent with Q4's backlog, which was elevated, but it is substantially larger than it was in Q1 2022, which is around $660 million. You're welcome. Good morning. Well, we have a pretty full pipeline on M&A, and we're going to do all the deals that make sense for our shareholders. So if we find transactions that make sense for the company and the shareholders, we'll find a way to do it. We've never really been concerned about a leverage number too much. I think Larry said in the past that we would take on substantial leverage for the fit \u2013 hike we just haven't found that animal yet. I mean right now at 1 times levered, I feel like we're under levered and I'd love nothing more than to find more opportunities to get that leverage number up. However, I do think our culture and our pattern of operations suggests that if we do borrow, we make a hell of an effort to delever quickly. And so as we move forward, outside of use of cash for, let's say, acquisitions, CapEx and things like that, we will be looking to reduce our credit exposure so that we can reload on other deals as they come in front of us. Thanks Peter. No, it really hasn't. The fourth quarter tax rate was substantially larger this quarter than Q1 of 2022, which the reason Larry mentioned is the lower benefit from tax stock option, the tax benefits that we experienced. If you look at the rate, it's 100% of the increase is due to that. I think for the year, we should fall out between 20% and 21%, kind of where we fell last year. I think that's where we'll wind up this year. Thanks, Larry. Well, I think our interest right now is running close to 6% on our debt. It's variable. We just borrowed $0.5 billion for Exxelia. So I haven't really given a forecast on that. But if you take our outstandings, it's going to be somewhere at $10 million. If you're thinking about a run rate, it could be around $10 million a quarter, something like that. Yes, around $700 million. That's a good question, Sheila. We knew that we would have a spend this quarter. The spend this quarter was rather concentrated rate of that $52 million, roughly $30 million that was related to distribution buys that relate to certain contracts that either renewed or renew. And so we have \u2013 we do have some bulking up in that area. \u2013 if you pull the $30 million out, it's $20 million worth of inventory spend, yes, that probably felt about right just for supporting our backlog. I don't anticipate huge investment in inventory like we had last year. In fact, with interest rates going up, I've encouraged the subs to be smart on that. But I've also told them that if they have customer demand, we don't want them to be in a situation where they don't have product to support the customers. So it's a delicate balance. But I don't believe that you'll see us have the same level of investment for the full year this year as we did last year. Thanks, Sheila. Ken, this is Carlos. Just to be clear because we didn't include this in the $5.1 million. If you add in to the ETG margin, if you add in the $5.1 million and then throw another $1 million in there for amortization costs related to the deal that's new. You get back to a margin that's very similar to what we had last year to what Victor was trying \u2013 was pointing out. You're welcome. So the one time stuff was $5.1 million, and what I was pointing out was that we took on some additional amortization for the month of January. It was close to $1 million. And that relates to new amortization. It has things in there such as inventory write-ups, purchase accounting amortization. So there's an element of that is kind of short term. The inventory write-up only lasts for a quarter and a half or something like that or a couple quarters. So there's an element of that additional $1 million, which it's not really a one-time cost. We're going to have the amortization going forward. But what the point I was trying to make was that if you kind of factor all that stuff in, the ETG is running around a 25% operating margin, which is what we posted last year at this time. That was the point of that statement. Good morning. Yes. So if you're looking at Q4 backlog, yes, a lot of \u2013 the majority of \u2013 not all of it, but the majority of it is Exxelia adding on that we picked up in January.

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 15% to $255.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $222.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions. The Electronic Technologies Group's organic net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were consistent with the prior year and principally reflected increased other electronics, commercial aviation and medical products net sales offset by decreased defense products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 2% to $56.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $55.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating income principally reflects the previously mentioned higher net sales volume, partially offset by higher acquisition costs and fees related to the Exxelia acquisition and a lower gross profit margin. The lower gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects decreased net sales of defense products, partially offset by increased net sales of our other electronics and commercial aviation products. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to 25% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The lower operating margin principally reflects the Exxelia acquisition costs, along with the lower gross profit margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Although as we anticipated, our defense net sales have been lower, the ETG's backlog remains at record levels, even factoring out Exxelia. Each ETG subsidiary is a unique business with unique drivers, but they are supplying mission-critical, high-reliability or harsh environment products which are required for their customers' products to operate. This remains a very positive dynamic and materially explains our strong backlog and our confidence going forward. While I don't have a crystal ball, as I previously mentioned, we expect our commercial aviation demand to remain strong this year and beyond, and the defense sales should strengthen in the later part of this year or even early next year, as higher defense budgets and defense spending kicks in. We also expect that our high-end other non-aerospace and defense markets, which have been very strong and continue to report record sales will become softer ahead due to what at least I believe, will be a reversion to normal ordering patterns by manufacturers as general supply chain conditions ameliorate. Hopefully, this coincides with the defense upturn though we can't be certain on the timing of each. Consistent with what we've often said and our experience over literally decades we believe the ETG should be a mid- to low single-digit organic sales grower over time with meaningful variations on that growth rate during individual quarters. This has been the ETG pattern since the business was formed in 1996. When asked on these calls what I believe our operating margins will be. You've heard me remark that I felt our cash margin which is the operating margin before acquisition accounting, which is the true economic margin business realizes would stay within the ranges we are now seeing obviously before considering the impact from future and unknown acquisitions. Keeping in mind that our noncash amortization expense is around 500 basis points. And that we had meaningful transaction expenses in the quarter from the Exxelia acquisition, which trimmed our operating margin by another couple of hundred basis points. Our companies continue to report excellent margins in the expected range. I'm often asked what impact Exxelia, which is a strong margin business, but has lower margins than our overall average should have an overall ETG margins, I would say it will probably be around 200, will probably trim around 200 basis points of consolidated margins going forward. before, of course, taking into effect any future and unknown acquisitions, still great margins overall. As we anticipated in our last conference call and other settings, our business has made material progress reducing supply chain delays, which we expect to continue, though unevenly throughout the year. By the way, in the first quarter, we roughly estimate that somewhere around a little shy of $30 million of shipments were delayed mostly into our second quarter versus over $40 million of delays during fiscal 2022's fourth quarter. Overall, we remain very excited about the ETG's prospects over time and are thrilled to have the irreplaceable set of businesses we operate in this group with strong margins and reasonable growth prospects. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Good morning, Scott. Yes. Generally speaking, we don't have a four and five-year pricing locked in on those LTAs. But there definitely is a lag effect on pricing \u2013 price adjustments, right? We generally don't have orders of less than a year. So usually, that takes some time to filter through. We've been pretty successful offsetting it over time. Almost all our companies feel that we will offset the inflationary effects. But there can be a delay in, let's say, six months or a year, we do have some longer-term pricing locked in, in some instances. Sure, Sheila. I think I assume those numbers include the dilution from the transaction expenses. So those are nonrecurring expenses, and that was \u2013 that probably accounted for a very good portion of that in the quarter. But the mix Exxelia is majority aerospace and defense. And then they have a variety of other markets. Some of it is energy. Some of it is clean energy. Some of it is transportation, trains, for example, and other electrification initiatives. So it's a pretty broad product base. And just across the board, their margins are generally lower than our margins. I wouldn't be surprised that over time those move up. I don't want to make a prediction as to that. I think it's a little too early to do that, but they certainly are margin-focused and their margins have been on an upward trend over the last, I don't know, four, five years. So we like that as well. Yes, I would \u2013 this is Victor. I would think that's probably right, low to mid single digits organic growth. I think it's a little early to tell with certainty. I mean again, when the defense budget \u2013 defense recovery moves in for us is really a little bit up in the air. Not that it's been bad by the way. I mean, our businesses are doing well in absolute terms. But I would expect that and later this year, possibly into next year, we would see it. I mean, I just \u2013 on timing, I just don't know. Supply chain by the way for us, from our vendors like I think a lot of other people, still not easy. But as I mentioned in my comments definitely improving. And our companies kind of across the board are saying either it's improving or at least not deteriorating. So that's a good sign. Sure, and that's what I was alluding to in my remarks is that over time people have said to me, look, on these calls in particular, where do you think the margins are going to be. And I would say, listen, I don't know exactly. But I then give you kind of think of where we are \u2013 where we were, which is kind of the origin of the cash margin, right? Low 30s, 32%, 31%, 33%, bouncing around in that range. And I've always said, listen, I think within 10% of that is probably reasonable, and that's where we're finding ourselves more or less before transaction expenses, et cetera. So I do think that's reasonable and that is mix sensitive. I mean, that is definitely mix sensitive. In defense, we have some higher margin products of which we're selling less right now. And that tends to shift over time. But it's definitely mix sensitive. Good morning. I mean \u2013 thank you. This is, it's still on the component side. And our businesses by so many different components, subcomponents plus raw materials, things like metals and silicones and so on. Those have been easier for us, but it's generally on the electronic component side, I mean, an area that remains difficult, I think for everybody in the industry.

So that's what I say. I think we'll continue to make progress. It will be uneven on it one quarter forward, maybe next one a little bit backward, but generally in the right direction. I think that's probably because people in the manufacturing chain generally, companies in the manufacturers generally have gone out and put more on the shelves. And I think there's going to be a reversion to the mean. And that will happen over some period of time, whether it's a year or six or nine months or I don't exactly know."

            "content": "Thank you, Samara, and thank you all on this call. Good morning to everyone and we thank you again for joining us. Welcome you to this HEICO first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation; and I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another very strong quarter. The growth and profitability of our operating companies continues to exceed my expectations. It's the people at our companies that make us exceptional and produce these outstanding results. Again thank you for another record-breaking quarter, and I continue to be optimistic that our growth will continue throughout fiscal 2023 and beyond. Summarizing the highlights of our first quarter fiscal 2023 record results. Consolidated first quarter fiscal 2023 net sales represent record results for HEICO, driven principally by record net sales within the Flight Support Group, mainly arising from continued rebound in the demand for our commercial aerospace products and services. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 improved 31% and 27%, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These results mainly reflect 14% quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth and the impact from our fiscal 2022 and 2023 acquisitions. Consolidated operating margin improved to 20.8% and in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and that was up from 20.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Consolidated net income increased 7% to $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and that was up from $86.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. It should be noted that net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022, were both favorably impacted by a discrete net income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net of control \u2013 non-controlling interest was $6.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, down from $17.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This information should be considered when analyzing the results, the comparative results between fiscal 2022 and 2023. In addition, the company incurred $5.1 million of acquisition costs related to the closing the Exxelia International acquisition in January 2023. And that decreased net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by approximately $4.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share. In my opinion, that should also be considered when analyzing the results of our first quarter. The comparatively lower tax benefit from stock option exercises and the onetime Exxelia acquisition costs reduced our diluted earnings by approximately $0.11. Our net debt, which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents of $640.2 million as of January 31, 2023 compared to shareholders' equity, was 23.3% as of January 31, 2023 and that compared to \u2013 sorry, 5.7% as of October 31, 2022. Obviously, the increase was the debt that we incurred to acquire Exxelia. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.02 times as of January 31, 2023, and that compared to 0.25 times as of October 2022, still a very, very low debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The increase in our net debt ratios in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflect the impact again from the purchase of Exxelia in January 2023 and that was HEICO's largest ever acquisition in terms of purchase price. Cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and that compared to $78 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The cash flow provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, reflects an increase in working capital, principally driven by an increase in inventories to support our increased consolidated backlog we continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal 2023. In January 2023, we increased our regular semiannual cash dividend by 11% to $0.10 per share. This represented our 89th consecutive semiannual cash dividend, which we have paid since 1979. Let me now discuss our recent acquisition activity. As mentioned previously, in January 2023, we acquired Exxelia International, our largest ever in terms of purchase price and revenue. We are excited about the European defense and aerospace opportunities, which Exxelia brings to HEICO, and we look forward to supporting their continued growth plans. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to HEICO's earnings per share within the first year of the transaction closing. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the first quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric? Thank you, Victor. And as for the outlook, we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2023 and continue to anticipate net sales growth in both Flight Support and ETG, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, continued inflationary pressures and lingering supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly to higher material and labor costs. During fiscal 2023, we plan to continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In closing, I would like to again thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. The remainder of fiscal 2023 looks promising, and I believe our unique culture of ownership and entrepreneurial spirit will continue to provide for outstanding operating results for our shareholders. Thank you all for what you do to make HEICO a great company. And with that, I would like to open the floor and the line for questions. Do you want to answer? Basically, we will continue right now to use our credit line, which we're underdrawn on that credit line. We have \u2013 we can go to $1.5 billion, and we have facility to go to $1.850 billion. And we're right now what Carlos $650 million or something like that. $700 million. So we have plenty of room on that. In the event that we were to consider something larger, we have spoken to our banks and the banks are fully supportive of going much further if we would like to. At the moment, we have no request into them to do that. But we've always spoken with them and said, in the event that we need additional funds, we can do that. As for issuing HEICO Class A stock and an acquisition. We normally don't do that because we find that because of our strong cash flow, we'd rather pay cash and reduce the debt balance quickly. As Carlos said earlier, we would increase the leverage amounts as long as we could bring them down to a much more manageable amount, which I consider in the area of 2x to 3x EBITDA \u2013 at 2x to 3x. We've never been at 2x EBITDA. We've always been below. And we will continue to be a low-levered company. We never intend to go as some companies go to 5x, 6x, 7x. We do not do that. Does that answer your question? Thank you. Good morning, Josh. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks Buddy. Thanks, Ron. Thank you. Again, this is Larry Mendelson, and I want to thank everybody on this call for your interest in HEICO. If you do have questions, we are available, Eric, Victor, myself, Carlos, so you can give us a call or e-mail. And we look forward to speaking to you at the Q2 earnings call, which will be in about three months from now. So have a good day, you all, and we'll speak to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 36% to a record $371.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $272.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 reflects strong 25% organic growth as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal 2022 acquisitions. The organic growth mainly reflects increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from continued recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 60% to a record $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up from $52.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, improved gross profit margin and efficiencies realized from the higher net sales volume. The improved gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and specialty products product lines and the impact of lower inventory obsolescence expenses primarily due to increased demand. The Fly Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 up from 19.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The operating margin increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and decreased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, mainly reflecting the previously mentioned efficiencies. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies to discuss the first quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Good morning. Hi Scott, yes, we've been able to get price increases. Our LTAs do permit us to adjust price, although typically, it's capped at various levels, depending on the level of business that the customers have with us. But yes, we've been successful in getting priced from our LTA customers as well as our non-LTA customers. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. Obviously, we're going to continue to treat our customers well, as I've said for the last year or so, we've got to make sure that we maintain our margins in this inflationary environment, both materials and labor are increasing in cost. And we need to make sure that we pass along that cost plus we're able to get a reasonable margin on top of it. So I think the numbers can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on mix. But I think we're in a pretty good area and where \u2013 we like where we are. We have not received a lot of price in these margins. We've received some. And I think there's an opportunity to get some more. But of course, as we replace inventories, inventory costs will be going up. So I'm reluctant to predict or to forecast the change in margins. I think that this is really a reasonable level. And we run the business very much as in the viewpoint of what's right for our customers and what's right for the business and the margin just sort of falls out of the end. So I don't have a way to tell what it's going to be, but I do feel that these are reasonable numbers going forward. Yes, we've seen some pickup in wide-body, yes. And everybody anticipates continued strengthening in those markets. Good morning. Good morning, Larry. Yes, we're very pleased with the numbers. Actually, our first quarter 2022 organic growth, I think, was 30%. So now we've done 25% on top of 30%, which is really quite outstanding. And it's, frankly, far more than we had internally predicted. Our businesses continue to do very well. And I've spoken with our salespeople over the last couple of weeks to understand our sales leadership to understand what's going on. And they anticipate basically continued strength in the business. I'm reluctant to anticipate growth beyond the level where we are. I mean, we grew 7% from the fourth quarter, just the quarter-on-quarter number top line. I think that we're running at a really solid rate. And I want to see a few more quarters to really understand where we are. None of our customers and our salespeople do not believe that the airlines are overstocking. But as I've cautioned everybody over the last number of quarters, every downturn, of course, is followed by a recovery and every recovery is followed by a slight overshoot. And I specifically asked this question to our sales leaders, are we in \u2013 do we have any indication that we're in the overshoot area? And the answer is no. Nobody thinks that we're in the overshoot area. So I'm cautiously optimistic. The numbers are incredible. They're phenomenal. I think we're capturing market share, and this is unique to HEICO. We've \u2013 we speak to our customers, and we see what's going on with other suppliers. And we think that, frankly, the performance at HEICO is really with regard to the aftermarket is industry-leading, and we're outperforming others. And that's as a result of being able to hold inventory, treating our customers, right, not jamming them with price increases, making sure that they get value. So I feel very good about where we are. Not particularly. Not particularly. As a matter of fact, we've had a little bit more intangible amortization. So that would have as a result of the acquisition. So that would have decreased the margins. So no, I don't think it's really a mix thing. I think we're just very efficient. We've got a great team. The thing that's interesting is I think that these margins are a result of, frankly, what we did a decade and two decades ago. They're not as a result of what we've done in the last year or two. When you treat your customers, right, you treat your people, right? You get into a virtuous cycle, and I think that's very much where we are. And I think we're reaping the benefits of the long-term the culture that we put into place over 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and that's what's driving these numbers. We have the parts when other people did. We continue to develop a lot of new PMAs and other products through the downturn. We continue to take inventory. We did all of the right things, and that's why these numbers are coming out and frankly, even surprising us. Hi. This is Eric. Good morning. Yes, we're doing quite nicely in the Chinese market. I mean, we're \u2013 we tend to be \u2013 I tend to not like to get into a lot of detail on specific customers or markets for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that we're doing very well. We've got a very good presence there, and I think we are well positioned to pick up market share and to continue to grow that market as it recovers. Frankly, our sales there have really been outstanding over the last year in excess of what we had predicted and frankly, where we were in 2019. And I think we'll continue to benefit as that market recovers. Yes, I'd be happy to do that. A couple of things. Of course, actually, they're interesting during the pandemic, actually, customers were so \u2013 see problems that I don't know that they were approving many alternative parts at that moment. However, we were very confident that we would ultimately get those parts approved. So we continue to develop, continue to manufacture them through the pandemic. So when the pandemic got to the end, we started getting a lot of parts approved. We hear from our customers that, that is not a PMA item; it's really a HEICO specific item. HEICO developed these parts, HEICO developed these repairs. And I think that our growth is really unique for the industry. So I'd be very careful. And I would not describe it as a broad interest in PMA. I think this is specifically a broad interest in HEICO. As we've gotten larger, we're a $20 billion market cap company. We've got deep technology and strong financial ability and our customers see that. And I think we've been rewarded with a unique opportunity right now. So \u2013 but as far as HEICO goes, we continue to develop a lot of parts and repairs. We've got a lot in progress. Our distribution businesses are doing very well in taking market share from others. So I anticipate continued growth, certainly over the numbers that we did last year. Again, our first quarter numbers were, frankly, so out of the park that I'm reluctant to predict increases off of those for the next couple of quarters, and we like to mature at this level. First, I'm not saying that we won't, but \u2013 and frankly, when we did our fourth quarter call two months ago, I had no belief that we would be hitting these numbers that we're hitting now. So, I prefer to be a little bit conservative going forward, but I do anticipate continued growth off of last year. Thank you. Yes, it's \u2013 good morning, Sheila and thanks for your question. I would say it is a strength across the board. We are getting significant sales of parts to customers who had not purchased those customers \u2013 not purchased those parts before. So, I anticipate continued increase there. Normally, when a customer switches to us, they buy all of their demand from us. So yes, part of it is we're seeing their own recovery and the volumes are increasing. But also a large part of it is we're doing very well and coming out with new products and getting those products sold. And then, of course, the flow-through between PMA and distribution has been very strong, and we've been helping our distribution principles of pain PMAs and we sell those parts as well. And that's worked out very well. So it's really broad-based strength. We still have \u2013 as far as geographies, we still have recovery opportunity, I would say, primarily in Asia as a result of the \u2013 those markets are still lagging, as you know, from your weekly report. So, I think that there's continued opportunity there. But yes, we are \u2013 we're past our 2019 numbers and really very, very happy about that. Yes, we \u2013 hi, Gautam. This is Eric. Yes, we definitely have seen supply chain challenges within FSG. Frankly, our sales and earnings would be even higher. If we got all these parts in which we're not able to get at the moment. Look, I think we're doing better than most, and that's as a result of our decentralized structure. We don't do Soviet Central planning at HEICO. We let the businesses figure out what they need. They stay very close to their customers. That's how everything is designed. And as a result, I think we were ahead of the curve and you saw our inventories go up a year ago, and now you've seen the results of having that inventory on the shelf. And now our inventories are up again and we're going to be in position to be able to support our customers is this level of sales hopefully continues to go up. But yes, we are definitely seeing the same supply chain challenges around materials and in particular labor at our suppliers. There were aerospace products are made in relatively small quantities for the aftermarket. And you'd be surprised how many manufacturers around the world and very high quality, good manufacturers had people retire and they sort of, if you will loss the recipe on how to do certain processes; and I'm talking major companies. So they've struggled getting people trained to be able to replicate those processes. And often, they make parts that have not been acceptable. So, but I think things are definitely getting better in that regard. We have heard at various places that, that is a consideration. I don't know if that's also partly designed to get us to manufacture more products for our customers. But yes, we can have a considerable impact on the cost of operation of older equipment. And when our customers commit to us long-term and we give them pricing protection, we can get into an area where our parts can be as much as 70% below the OEM after many years, and we still drive very nice margins and the airlines save a lot of money. So I do think it's a factor, but I think the larger factor is the overall cost of the aircraft, what they want to do in terms of reliability, fleet simplification, all of that stuff. But there's no question that we are a major cost driver for them, especially as the aircraft get old. So the defense market that we've got, let's see, the, yes. The defense market was up a greater percentage. We do have a lot of components on \u2013 in the missile defense area, and we're particularly strong there. Look, it can bounce around year-over-year. I'm very pleased with the numbers. We've made a big push into defense, and we're doing very nicely. I would say the big difference, Louis, is that the Flight Support defense stuff in general doesn't have the same supply constraints with regard to certain electronics that ETG has. ETG is get more susceptible to the chip issues. And over on the flight support side, we don't have a lot of that. So that's really the main driver there. Yes. It is a huge opportunity, and we have a big focus in that area. Yes. Ron, this is Eric. Yes, I would say that there has been some opportunity in that area. But normally that's sort of not the area, the folks who are having those issues, in general, are not the companies that we're working with. So I don't anticipate it at this point, being a huge opportunity for us. I mean, frankly, the large companies have to make sure paid as they have been getting paid earlier from the government that they take care of their supply base. And I think those companies are more in that general realm. So it's not as applicable to us to the kind of revenues. Yes. I think I don't have specific information on that. But yes, I do believe that we are selling parts for checks that had not been anticipated. I don't think it's a large part of our sales. But yes, I am aware that we are benefiting from that."

I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. And Mr. Mendelson, please go ahead.\nLaurans Mendelson: I'm sorry. Thank you, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO fourth quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson. Eric is HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now, before discussing our record operating results, I want to sincerely thank HEICO's talented team members for their exceptional contribution to our success. Your dedication to exceeding customer expectations and achieving operational excellence has driven outstanding results and reinforces my confidence in HEICO's future. Over the past several years, we have achieved extraordinary growth in commercial aviation, emerging stronger than ever from a very challenging period in the aerospace industry. Our team members' resilience and adaptability during this time of rapid recovery and expansion have been remarkable. Equally commendable is the agility shown by our recent acquisitions, which have seamlessly integrated into our operations and enhanced our collective success. I'm also encouraged by our progress in expanding our presence in key markets such as defense and space. These sectors are critical to long-term strategy, and our team members' commitment to delivering innovative, reliable and best-cost solutions has strengthened HEICO's reputation as a trusted partner. This focus for us for continued growth and success across diverse markets. I'll now summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO and improved by 15% and 8%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated net income increased 35% to a record $139.7 million, or $0.99 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from a $103.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, improving 15% and 35%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect strong 12% organic growth, mainly attributable to increased demand for Flight Support Group's commercial aviation products and services, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated EBITDA increased 13% to $264 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $234.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.06 times as of October 31, '24, and that was down from 3.04 times as of October 31, '23. Our excellent operating results have allowed us to early achieve the forecast we made a year ago, that our net debt to EBITDA ratio would return to a historical level of about 2 times within roughly one year to 18 months following the Wencor acquisition, and that excluded the impact of any additional acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is extremely robust with opportunities in both Flight Support and ETG, and we intend to follow our time-tested strategy of opportunistic acquisitions that continue to expand the cash-generating ability of HEICO. Cash flow provided by our operating activities increased 39% to $205.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $148.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Yesterday, HEICO's Board of Directors declared an $0.11 per share cash dividend payable in January 2025, and this represents our 93rd consecutive dividend, and this reflects their continued confidence in the strong cash flow generation of HEICO. Now, let me talk about acquisition activity. Over the past few months, our ETG Group made several strategic acquisitions, one, acquiring 70% of SVM Private Limited in November '24, they acquired 87.9% of Mid Continent Controls in October '24, and they acquired 92.5% of Marway Power Solutions in September 2024. In addition, in August '24, our Flight Support Group acquired the Aerial Delivery and Descent Devices division of Capewell Aerial Systems. All of these acquisitions were funded by using cash provided by operating activities, except for Capewell, which was principally funded using proceeds from our revolving credit facility. We expect each of these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings within the following year of acquisition. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 15% to a record $691.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from $601.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and very strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects increased demands across all of our product lines. The Wencor operations continue to exceed our expectations, and we are convinced this was an excellent acquisition for HEICO. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs, which has translated into excellent growth opportunities and success for both our legacy businesses and Wencor. We continue to operate Wencor as a standalone business operation. I have defined our strategy as cooperation, capabilities and consistency without consolidation. The sales, earnings and margins proved this was the perfect strategy. As I have mentioned before, we continue to make good progress working together in serving our customers in a combined seamless fashion. Some examples of how we are working together include, one, utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all repair stations, two, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation, three, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO non-competitive PMAs, four, Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base to quote many new products, five, engineering and regulatory cooperation, six, sharing our best-in-class vendors, and seven, various back office synergies such as insurance, payroll, retirement benefits and export compliance, that will help offset additional regulatory compliance costs, such as SOX and our FAA, ODA. In many -- in addition, the FSG's defense sales continue to grow and offer an excellent opportunity. Many people have asked us what the US presidential administration change will mean for HEICO. In short, we are very excited about it. Whether it's the chance to sell more of our much lower cost alternative aircraft replacement parts to save the government and taxpayers significant money or other opportunities, the possibilities are many. HEICO has always been about finding cost savings or best cost solutions for our customers, whether they're defense or commercial customers, and not about getting the highest price out of them. Another example of the opportunity set is the components we make for missile defense systems, which is a strong and growing business for us. Missile defenses are increasingly important to the United States and our allies, with sales of these products growing dramatically amidst what is effectively a shortage of defense missiles and a very large backlog stretching over years. We expect meaningful growth from this existing backlog alone. Moving on to operating income. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 35% to $154.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, a decrease in acquisition costs, and an improved gross margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangible amortization expense consumed approximately 270 basis points of our operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, the FSG's cash margin before amortization, or what we call EBITDA, and the way we measure our businesses internally, was approximately 25.0%, which has been consistently excellent during 2024, and is 300 basis points higher than the comparable FSG cash margin of 22% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. I am extremely pleased with these results. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs and improved gross profit margin as well as a higher level of SG&A efficiencies resulting from the previously mentioned net sales growth. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $336.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, as compared to $342.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales decrease in the fourth quarter principally reflects lower defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by increased space products net sales and the impact from our fiscal '24 acquisitions. This is in line with our expectations, as we've commented on earnings calls over the past few quarters, and is consistent with inventory destocking of some customers, particularly those in the non-aerospace and defense markets. Our defense sales growth was nicely healthy in the fiscal '24 year, though this growth varied highly by quarter, which, as you know, has historically been the case, and we anticipate the ETG's quarterly defense sales volatility will continue, but the overall trend remains positive. As expected, other electronic net sales were lower during the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201923 due to customer restocking. The low single-digit organic net sales decline was a much lower decline than in prior quarters and I believe recent better order flow and backlog indicate the de-stocking trends are improving. I continue to expect a return to growth in these and other electronic end markets and businesses during the first half of fiscal \u201825. The ETG's fourth quarter record backlog and strong overall orders support our optimism and as the non-A&D markets improve, we continue to anticipate growth into our next fiscal year. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $81.8 million in the fourth quarter fiscal \u201824, as compared to $86.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823. The operating income change principally reflects a less favorable gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned decreased defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned increased space products and net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group\u2019s operating margin was 24.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 25.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Importantly, before acquisition-related intangibles amortization expense, our operating margin was above 28% as intangibles amortization consumes around 400 basis points of our margin. Now that's how we judge our businesses as that most closely correlates to cash. So, on what we think of as a true operating basis, these are excellent margins, and we are very pleased with it. The operating margin change principally reflects the previously mentioned less favorable gross profit margin and the lower level of SG&A efficiencies. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Victor, thank you. Now as for the outlook, as we look ahead to fiscal '25, we do anticipate net sales growth in both light support and electronic technologies, driven primarily by organic growth, supported by strong demand for the majority of our products. In addition, we plan to drive growth through our recently completed acquisitions while positioning ourselves to capitalize on potential opportunities from future acquisitions and to provide new cost savings and best cost opportunities to our government in the new administration's efficiency efforts. Our priorities include continued strong new products and services development, further expanding market penetration, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, all with a strong emphasis on delivering long-term value to our shareholders. In closing, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt appreciation to our exceptional team members for their steadfast support and commitment to HEICO. Our strategy of cultivating a diverse portfolio of outstanding businesses continues to yield positive results for our shareholders. With strong key markets, fiscal '25 is poised to be another successful year. We thank you for your continued confidence in HEICO. And as I've shared before, I remain highly positive about HEICO's future. Thank you, all. And now, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nLarry Solow: Great. Good morning. Congratulations on another good quarter, good year. I guess the first question, maybe a couple for Eric, you gave us a lot of good detail on the Wencor acquisition. Sounds like things are really going well there. Just curious, you mentioned some of -- obviously this is one of the bigger acquisitions that could get ever done and you spoke about a lot of things there. Curious, as we look out going forward, are there still opportunities to gain even more revenue synergies or other things? Now you've had this under the hood for a little more than a year, under the -- under your umbrella, excuse me, things that maybe you didn't think were available or sort of positive surprises that you could work on going forward on that side of the business?\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Larry, and thanks for your question. First of all, we -- as you pointed out, we're very happy with the Wencor acquisition. It has been immensely successful and exceeded all of our wildest expectations. Number one, starting with the people, they are outstanding. They really fit the HEICO culture. The companies are very similar, and the businesses are working extremely well together. We're in a unique situation that all of our aftermarket businesses are running, of course, at record numbers, performing exceptionally well. And they are so busy just trying to accomplish what they've each got in their backlog in terms of getting the parts out the door and developing all this new stuff that we've just left them alone right now. I do think that there is an additional opportunity in further cooperation and going to the customers with a bigger basket. But as of now, I mean, you can see with these kinds of results, 12% organic growth, 13% in the aftermarket. Following a tremendous deal like that, that beats what anybody thought was possible. So we're very, very happy with that. But we do think that there are additional opportunities. Our teams are working very closely together in the parts and repair side to harvest those opportunities. We've already been very successful by putting all of the HEICO and the Wencor PMAs as well as the HEICO and Wencor DER repairs together. So our repair stations can focus on particular unit and really drive costs down and service levels up to the customer. And we've been very successful in that, and we anticipate continued success in that area. So yes, I think as I said internally, I think Wencor is going to be the gift that keeps on giving, not only because of Wencor, but because of the HEICO legacy businesses and really being the perfect fit there and just going so well.\nLarry Solow: Got it. And, Eric, you mentioned that you touched on it briefly just on your opportunities maybe increasing on the military side of the business under the new administration, whether it be through DOGE or whatever, it just does seem like there are a lot of opportunities solely on the military side, right, on the government side. Just any more color there? Is that something we should look forward to near term? Is that more of a mid to longer-term opportunity? I know you've always been kind of focused, obviously, getting more into the military aircraft side, I guess, right? Where I think there's not much on the PMA side there. So, any more color there would be great.\nEric Mendelson: We -- that's a great question, and we are extremely excited about this opportunity. This is real simple low-hanging fruit. I mean DOGE is something I think everybody in the country realizes that we've got to spend our dollars more wisely and HEICO offers various solutions without getting into the specifics because we have our competitors on the call and I welcome them to it but of course we can't lay out a roadmap for them of what we're going to do. But needless to say, I think there is a tremendous amount of low-hanging fruit. HEICO was working on all of this before the election. And so we were very hopeful that there would be a number of breakthroughs. We are still hopeful of that. And DOGE just pours more fuel on the fire. When you look at the budget deficit and the amount of money that has to be cut, there are tremendous cost savings opportunities. And we think that it's not only cost, but there's also, and without, I have to be very careful because of course I don't want to provide a roadmap to our competitors, but there are a number of areas whereby, in particular, in the development of new products where HEICO can offer increased quality and by the way that's not just the tagline, that's proven and through various rig tests, increased quality, better development timelines, and lower cost. So I think DOGE is going to be outstanding for us. Now, having said that, you asked is this going to be short, medium, or long term, I think it's going to be more medium-term. I mean in the short-term the government has its money committed, so that's going to be what it is. But I do feel that this is just additional clarity and legs for HEICO as we move forward. But I expect the opportunities to be very, very substantial because it's just not only about price.\nLarry Solow: Got it, great, I appreciate all that color. Maybe just lastly a question for Carlos, just margins. I know you don't guide specifically, but just sort of a high-level outlook for the coming year. FSG was -- looking back, was pretty consistent in fiscal \u201824. And ETG, I know, is a little bit more mix dependent. So just any thoughts as we look into fiscal 25? Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: I think, as we look at the Flight Support Group, it's performing as expected. We're posting between 23% and 24% operating margins pretty consistently. I think our build on that will be slight improvements as we continue to grow the base of the business. We'll get SG&A leverage on some of our fixed costs, which should be additive to the margin. Very similar to what we did a decade prior to COVID. It'll be small steps. It's not going to be ratcheted moves. And look, in the ETG, I've been saying for a while that when the mix settles out, I would expect that segment on a GAAP basis to come around the 24% margin range. And this quarter I was very pleased to see them exceed that. So, as I look into \u201825, I would expect the business to continue to be lumpy as it always has been. We'll have quarters that are higher and lower. But my baseline is around that 24% range.\nLarry Solow: Got it. Great. Thanks, Carlos. Appreciate it.\nCarlos Macau: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nScott Mikus: Good morning. This is Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning. Hi, Scott.\nScott Mikus: Eric, you brought up DOGE and saving money across the federal government. So I'm just wondering, can you quantify right now what percentage of FSG sales are directed to the DoD? And then for programs other than the commercial derivatives like the P-8, have you already started the process of aggregating a list of potential parts that could be sold to the DoD?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So, as far as what percentage goes to the DoD, I don't have that information in front of me, but I can tell you that defense is approximately a quarter of the FSG sales. So you get an idea there. In terms of the opportunity, we -- the opportunity is not only in the areas that you mentioned, but yes, we have come up with a list. We are aware of what the opportunities could be. Of course, I don\u2019t want to -- I can't outline it on the call, but we are -- it is quite substantial. And the government really should be should be saving these dollars.\nScott Mikus: Okay. And then also going back to Wencor, they used a lot of [build] (ph) to print shops in the past to manufacture parts. You talked about insourcing some of that manufacturing. Can you talk about where you are in that journey and is there more cost savings to gain from insourcing even more of that work?\nEric Mendelson: Absolutely, yeah. We've got very broad manufacturing capabilities at HEICO and we are focusing on Wencor's robust new product development in terms of manufacturing that stuff within various HEICO businesses. There is an opportunity to resource some of the existing business. As long as our vendors treat us right and are fair with us, we're very loyal to them. So they have nothing to worry about. And frankly, the new pipeline is so robust that it will really keep our shops very busy. But again, we think the opportunity is really very, very strong in that area.\nScott Mikus: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions, and happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you, and happy holidays to you too, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\nKen Herbert: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Eric\u2026\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nKen Herbert: Just to start, as you look at FSG organic growth within the fiscal \u201925, I know you're probably not going to get too specific, but is there any reason we shouldn't see double-digit organic growth again across FSG and fiscal 25?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I -- no, I don't think there's any reason you shouldn't see it. We're very optimistic on our three disaggregated revenue bucket of parts, repair and specialty products, they're all very strong. And so I think that that is -- a double-digit expectation is reasonable. I mean, of course, we're only 45 days into the year. So we always want to be a little circumspect and always at the end of the year between Thanksgiving and the New Year, volumes can be skewed one way or the other depending on shipments from our vendors to us and then what the customers want and the way they manage their inventory. So I don't like to take the months of November and December in order to prognosticate the rest of the year. But yeah, our internal numbers are for double-digit organic growth within the Flight Support and again, very strong in all three of our segments.\nKen Herbert: Okay. that\u2019s very helpful.\nCarlos Macau: This is Carlos. Just keep in mind, while we don't really have seasonality to our business, one thing Eric just pointed out is very important. Our first quarter typically with the holidays tends to be a little lighter than the second, third and fourth quarter. So just keep that in mind when you're thinking about what he just said.\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. And always November and December, I mean, for the 35 years I've been at the company, November and December are historically lower types of months. And January is always the month that drives the first quarter. So of course, we're not yet in January, so it's hard to say. But our internal numbers are very optimistic, and our business heads are extremely optimistic and frankly, more optimistic than I've ever seen them.\nKen Herbert: Okay. That's very helpful. And just one more, if I could. There's obviously been a lot of commentary recently around greater confidence in sort of execution in terms of new aircraft deliveries and new engine deliveries out of the OEMs. What's your view on if things do start to perform better there, how quickly can fleets really start to sort of turn around to become younger? How quickly do you think spending on some of the legacy assets would actually start to slow -- and legacy aircraft would start to slow as that tide does ideally get better in 2025 and '26 in terms of just sort of the execution on the airframe and the engine OEM side, if that makes sense?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. So number one, I have tremendous respect for the airframe and the engine OEMs. They're phenomenal companies. They build incredible products. But unfortunately, they are at the -- they're dependent on their supply chains. And those supply chains, as we know, got terribly beat up through COVID, as many companies slash their orders, and the people are just not at the suppliers. So they talk about increasing the production rates, and I think that's the intent. And marginally, they have in some areas, but I think they've had a lot of challenges. And I can tell you, I go around to our businesses, and I see the supply chain challenges that exist, and they are still tremendous. So I personally am not putting any money down that the supply from the OEM suppliers is going to turn around substantially. I have not seen evidence of that. So I expect the aftermarket to continue to remain very strong. And I think airlines have been bitten so badly by the deferrals that they don't want to get in the situation where they don't have the legacy assets to be able to complete their routes and their schedule. So, I expect them to continue to spend money, I mean not foolishly, but they've got to always have a backup plan. And that's why I think the aftermarket is going to be strong. In addition, if you look even with the OEM deliveries increasing, if you look at the available seat miles and what IATA predicted, I mean 8% available seat miles increasing in 2025. This is a huge number. And frankly, it would be very easy to absorb the additional seats and keep the older aircraft in service. So we -- based on the order trends that we see, it remains very, very strong for the legacy aircraft. So, I, at this moment, don't see a change there.\nKen Herbert: Great. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: Yeah. I was wondering, DoD and PMA parts, what historically has been the disconnect there on their ability -- on their willingness to entertain buying those? Is it -- I'm just curious, like, do they require OEM parts or is it just culture? Or I'm just curious like what actually has prevented [indiscernible]\nEric Mendelson: They don't have a process. As Carlos says, they don't have a box to check. And what the airlines had to have, and this is what we worked on 35 years ago. When I first went into the airlines and showed them what we could do and said we could develop all these additional stuff, they said to me, that's a great idea, but we can't buy PMA parts. And I said, well, what do you mean, you're already buying our combustion chambers where the fuel and air is mixed and burned, and we've supplied those parts to you for 20 years with a flawless service record, why can't you should be able to buy these additional parts and this is the process that we're going to use with the FAA, and frankly, this is the box that you have to check, and that's been immensely successful. So I think the government must change. This cannot be business as usual. The United States cannot continue to irresponsibly run at these budget deficits. And there is no reason if a part is good enough for the President or the Vice President or senators or representatives or the Secretary of Defense to fly on when they fly commercially, maybe the President doesn't, but everybody else certainly does when they fly commercially, but it can't be used for the DoD. That is nonsense. It's a relic of the past. And I think the government recognizes this is low-hanging fruit. This must change. And frankly, HEICO is the one to do it. And we've got a lot of opportunities. I need to be very careful. And obviously, you know us well, and I don't want to get into details on specifically what, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the opportunity here. And we think it's very substantial. And I just want to add that we still think that the current providers are going to continue to do very well. And HEICO provides products to the DoD, and there's still tremendous number of products out there and not everything lends itself to what we can provide. But I think what we can provide is very significant for HEICO.\nGautam Khanna: That makes sense. And just to follow up on that, is the opportunity biggest on the commercial derivatives like Tanker and P-8 with where you may have comparable products on the commercial aircraft that they're built on? Or is there a big opportunity beyond that?\nEric Mendelson: I think that there is a very large opportunity in both. On the commercial derivatives, this is a no-brainer. I mean, this is just -- it's a no-brainer. And again, they already use some of the parts. So it's not that they're fundamentally opposed, it's just they need that box to check. And then when you go outside of the commercial derivatives, there are also significant savings opportunities that can occur. And we think that there are very large opportunities there as well. But again, I don't want to over commit because these are not short term -- this is not a fiscal 2025 impact. This obviously comes later, but I think it's a very nice add-on to all of the good stuff that we're currently doing.\nGautam Khanna: That makes sense. And last one, Carlos, I was wondering if you could give us some framework for the inorganic contribution in the opening fiscal year based on what you've already acquired?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, sure. So I don't want to give subsidiary outlook. I think that the contributions will be they're not going to be immaterial, if that's helpful. I'm being careful because we've not -- we've done recent some recent acquisitions, and I don't want to get into the subsidiary details. But on the FSG side, Wencor lapsed this quarter, and we'll have Capewell next year in the inorganic bucket the first three quarters. It won't be material to the segment. And of course, in ETG, we had three recent acquisitions that -- again, I don't think it's going to be material for the quarter. So, it's pretty much mostly organic next year.\nGautam Khanna: Great. Thanks. Happy holidays, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Same to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. Eric, if I could start with you, if that's okay, please. If we could just talk about the organic growth within FSG up 12% and then just the different parts of the business, right? Aftermarket parts is up 13%, slightly down from 17% last quarter. How do you think about the parts business trending into \u201825? Can it still grow double digits? And what did the -- what are you seeing with MROs versus airlines, the demand there?\nEric Mendelson: Well, first of all, good morning, Sheila, and thank you for your questions. We are very optimistic on the continued growth, as I mentioned in all of the segments. In breaking down our organic growth, the parts side definitely had the highest organic growth in 2024. And the area with the lowest organic growth was our specialty products. We think that in 2025, based on backlogs that we already have in the specialty products area that our organic growth is going to accelerate in that area, and it will remain a strong double-digits within the parts side. Component repair is probably going to be somewhat in between those. But we also anticipate, I would say strong, I'd say double-digit growth, and I am expecting double-digit growth, frankly, in all three of our disaggregated areas, the parts, component repair and specialty products.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then -- sure. And then maybe if we could talk about Wencor a minute. Any way to quantify the revenue synergies? How you think about their 6,000 SKUs relative to your 15,000 or so? How many have penetrated into your customer base? And then maybe a PMA question unrelated to the defense side of the business, but do you see PMA becoming easier under the new administration?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. So, specifically with regard to Wencor, if you take a look at our organic growth within parts and component repair, you'll see that there's approx -- there's over $60 million, approximately $62 million, of organic growth in the fourth quarter in just parts and repair. That's all organic. And remember, we owned Wencor basically for the pretty much the entire fourth quarter of last year. For HEICO and Wencor to grow $60 million organically, no acquisitions, that's huge, and frankly, far beyond anything that I thought was ever possible. We've got incredible teams, incredible leaders in these businesses. I think HEICO's competitive advantage is the way that we have these businesses structured, where we have them as individual business units, each with its own business head and its own leadership team, combined with central sales forces to be able to help them get out there. There is a tremendous amount of unsold potential. There is so much more help that we can give our customers and it's just a matter of getting out there or getting in front of them and making sure that they switch from their old legacy solution into a new HEICO solution. So, I expect the future to be very strong, and I'm very encouraged. And when I go out and talk to our folks, so are they. When I look also into the specialty products, when we look at what our backlogs are in these areas, they're tremendous. And now really the challenge is executing and getting product from the vendors out there in the field and subcontractors, because the market is incredibly tight. I don't go to any businesses where they say, yeah, we're all caught up, everything is back to 2019, not a prayer. The labor force has changed. The -- it's very difficult to be able to ramp. And so that's why I'm very bullish in all of our areas. You had asked about the military side. I think that's just added opportunity, because we've spoken about it, that for years HEICO has operated in that area, and we've had limited success. But as a result of the comments that I made in the prior couple of questions, I think this is really low-hanging fruit for HEICO. And the government got to make cost savings an imperative. And the new administration certainly is doing that to a degree that we've never seen before in the history of this country. And it's wise that they do so because, as a country, we're running out of money. And HEICO can provide, again, not only the cost savings as a result of using our parts or using our technology, but also when these systems are developed by the government, there's a tremendous approach which slows things down. And I'm really very excited for DOGE because I think they can accelerate a lot of these processes. And HEICO is going to be, I think, a tremendous beneficiary across our Flight Support as well as our Electronic Technologies business because we are smaller businesses that are competitively focused in various areas, lower cost, higher quality. We can get it done quickly. And if the government wants it fast, I believe it's a huge opportunity for us.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Eric, I'm sorry, I meant more on the commercial side. Do you think the administration makes it easier to PMA commercial parts as well?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I think -- look, the administrations have always been supportive. The FAA has been frankly outstanding to work with over the last 35 years. I expect that to continue. I don't expect a change there. If you will, the civilian workforce has been great to work with. So I expect everything continuing and no change in our ability to get PMAs. We've gotten more PMAs than ever, and I expect that to continue.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks, Sheila.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nEric Mendelson: Hey, Scott. Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Eric, can you give us any sense of what the growth acceleration at specialty products could look like next year? Because it sounds like you got a lot of tailwinds there between the OE ramp and the missile defense growth. And I was just looking at my model, and there was a period of time in 2022 and 2023 where specialty products was growing over 50% pretty regularly. So I'm not trying to get too excited here, but just trying to get a sense of whether something like that could perhaps repeat itself. Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. The internal numbers I've got are really strong over in specialty products. As I've mentioned, really the key is being able to get products out of certain suppliers. But I think from what we're seeing and based on what the budgets are and everything, at least 10% organic growth seems to be very reasonable. And when you think of it, I know that on a spreadsheet, and I think everybody appreciates it's on a spreadsheet, it's easy. You put in point one, and it's easy to type that in. But when you think about this, when a business grows organically by 10% a year, it doubles in seven years, quadruples in 14 years. And these businesses to accomplish a 10% growth rate, I think that's just tremendous and incredible in this market that we've got with constrained material and constrained labor. So I'm very optimistic in those areas.\nScott Deuschle: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up, Eric. I think it seems like there's a number of airlines that have built up some inventory of spare aftermarket parts. I think United is one of them. I guess, have you seen any evidence of customer inventory build for your specific parts or airlines generally pretty hand-to-mouth for HEICO parts?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I think on HEICO parts they're pretty hand-to-mouth. They certainly don't tell us when they have a surplus. I'm not aware of any material oversupplies at the airlines. I mean they're all wanting these parts very badly. There are always puts and takes with that, but I think it's all very strong. Also, since HEICO has got a really good delivery program and we're able to supply so many of these parts in the month of order, airlines are -- they don't typically have to overstock our parts because they can rely on us pretty well.\nScott Deuschle: Right. Okay. Thank you. Happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks. And happy holidays to you too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: How's it going? Happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Good. Happy holidays to you too.\nNoah Poponak: I wanted to ask about the FSG margin, fielding some questions on that last night and this morning. I think the final full year is probably a decent amount higher than what you were projecting at the beginning of the year, but also kind of outperformed through the year. And then in the fourth quarter, it's down sequentially. So I guess, is the non-cash piece higher? Or can you just give me those numbers 4Q versus 3Q? Or is there anything else abnormal whether it's a cost or mix in that fourth quarter margin? And then if you could speak to where you think those margins can go next year? That would be helpful.\nCarlos Macau: No, this is Carlos. Let me take a stab at that. So you're digging deep in my brain here. So we're down about 20 bps Q3 to Q4. I'd almost consider that a little noise. There is a little bit more amortization in the fourth quarter this year than last year, which probably contributed to that blip. There isn't a lot of -- there's not a lot of noise in either quarter for unusual things like that. I will tell you that I've been pretty open and vocal that my expectation on the FSG is that the margins go between 22% and 23%. And that's what we've done. And we're basically at 22.5% for the year. So pretty much did what I thought it would do. And I think that as we move forward, the things that I can count on other than mix shifts or something like that, would be some incremental gains in that margin due to leverage on our costs. So one thing the FSG has done very well as the revenue base has grown, they've done that without, in a very efficient manner. The SG&A spend has been down as a percent of revenue consistently all year. I expect that trend to continue, and that's really where we're going to eke out these little incremental margin gains. Again, absent any big shift in mix, that's what my expectations are going to the next year.\nNoah Poponak: Yeah. Carlos, I guess it makes sense in a way that you referenced that range over time, but there's no -- I guess that makes it sound like you expect it to be kind of flat over time. But I would think that you would have -- I mean, historically, you've had a pretty consistent 25%, 30% incremental margin in that business as you're able to -- when you're in an environment where you're growing revenue double digits or even mid to high single you're probably not growing cost as quickly as you're growing revenue, right?\nCarlos Macau: That's absolutely correct. And no, I don't think they're going to be flat. No, I hope I didn't mean to insinuate that. What I'm insinuating is that I expect margin improvement. It's going to be -- if you look back historically, pre-COVID or the decade prior to that, our margins were growing 20 bps, 30 bps a year, and it was based on volume growth in the business. As we grow, to your point, we're not -- the cost base isn't growing as fast as revenues. I expect that to continue. And absent any big swings in mix, then that should be the cadence that we see moving forward.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then I wanted to ask about the other industries outside of the defense, space, aero within ETG. I think that down in the quarter, that being the fifth quarter in a row where it's down, so it was the first quarter where you were lapping the easier compare, but it's down again. So I guess, can you talk about what's behind that? And then what it would take to get that piece to stabilize and start to grow again?\nVictor Mendelson: Yeah. This is Victor, Noah. So it's not necessarily a one-year event to wash out the overordering, which took place over, I think, a longer period of time. It probably took place over 2, 2.5 years. But as I said in the comments, my general sense is that we start -- that reverses starts to reverse sometime in the first half of our year. And we see signs of that in a number of businesses where basically, it looks like the order rate has started to turn up in some instances and others, it's kind of bouncing along the bottom. And sometimes we get an occasional positive surprise, we end the month doing better than we expected in both sales and orders in a couple of cases recently. And just our experience has been when this happens, that sometime in the neighborhood of half a year later, it could be a little more. It could be a little less, but somewhere in that neighborhood. It starts to show up with rising sales sequentially. And so I would expect that that would play out like it typically does barring, of course, any unforeseen events, but that's what I would expect.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's helpful. Victor, appreciate it. Just one last quick one. The corporate in the quarter is fairly high compared to where it had been running. You guys don't strike me as big corporate expense guys. Is there something abnormal in that or how should we think about the run rate moving forward?\nCarlos Macau: No, I think we typically run about 1.5% of sales or something like that in corporate expenses. I mean, as you can imagine, over the last four years, we've had tremendous inflation, things like insurance and benefits and all those things rise. We also have a little noise with FX. As the dollar weakened, we had some FX challenges. But nothing extraordinary. I mean I think the trend going forward, we should continue to be 1.4%, 1.5% of sales in that. As the company grows, we don't have lavish expenditures, but we do need arms and legs to keep track of everything. So that's principally, the zip code we\u2019ll run in.\nNoah Poponak: Got it, Great. Thank you so much.\nCarlos Macau: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and happy holidays here.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Eric, just -- I mean, we've talked a lot about FSG and the trajectory and -- but I guess, just looking at the sequential growth, one of the lowest sequential growth rates that we've seen in several quarters, was there anything unusual in this quarter versus last quarter? I mean, it sounds like all business lines, all capabilities are running up record levels. Any notable changes or behavioral changes from customers that maybe pick that sequential FSG revenue down a bit?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. I mean, a couple of things. Number one, I should state that one of the metrics that we never look at HEICO in any of the businesses is sequential growth rate. Because things can move around, they can bounce around and that can exaggerate it. The number that we always look at is the annual growth rates are compared to what we've done in the prior year. And when I look at our FSG organic growth, I mean, basically, it was approximately in the first quarter, 12%. Second quarter, 12%. Third quarter, 15%. And fourth quarter, 12%. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's out of the park, that is phenomenal, and is so far above what anybody else does in this industry with regard to organic growth. So I'm super happy with it. And we just don't look, I mean, compare one quarter to the next. I mean if we didn't get overly excited when between basically the second quarter to the third quarter, we had big sequential growth, I mean that can be due to various deals or all sorts of stuff. I mean, what's more important is the comparison to the annual. And we think that, that is incredibly strong. And sometimes these moves and the numbers move in various jumps. So it's really dangerous to look at it in a sequential basis like that.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then just one other housekeeping one for Eric -- or sorry, for Victor. Victor, did you give the ETG organic growth rate for the quarter at the consolidated level?\nVictor Mendelson: Did we provide that?\nCarlos Macau: I mean ETG, I can do it. ETG was down low single-digits, it's like approximately 4% down for the quarter organically. And contributing to that was what we talked about earlier, the other electronics and defense offset by space. That's pretty much what happened. I think in total for the quarter, we were up 3% with some acquired growth in there, but the organic side was down roughly 4%.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys. I'll check back.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nEric Mendelson: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Pete.\nPete Skibitski: Just a couple quick ones maybe for Carlos. Carlos, just because D&A is a pretty big add-back for you guys in cash flow. Do you have an expectation for D&A for \u201825? And then also was just wondering sort of post-COVID, post-Wencor, the use of working capital, especially in inventory, has been larger. I'm just wondering if that was kind of a short-term thing or if we should expect a greater build in inventory going forward? Thanks.\nCarlos Macau: Sure. So actually I think our D&A, I expect it to be very similar next year to this year. Depending on how many acquisitions we do next year, it could flux up on the A side, but as a percentage, I expect it to be roughly the same as it was this year. As far as working capital use, it's interesting. We came into this year with a lot of commitments on products that our guys purchased multiple years ago because of some of the supply chain callanges we had. And we took delivery on that stuff towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year. And we talked a little bit about how that would probably skew our annual inventory being a little higher than what we would normally expect as far as spend-wise goes. I do expect that to moderate a tad as we get into '25 because a lot of those firm commitments we had made on inventory coming out of COVID where some of these deals had two-year lead times and we had to commit two years in advance, a lot of that stuff we sort of took our last deliveries on as we got into the beginning of this fiscal year. So we should see a little bit of a calm down in inventory. As we grow the business organically, we've got to support it with more inventory spend. But I don't know that the slope of that spend will be as high as it had been in the prior few years. Our receivable management is impeccable. We have very little consumption of working capital for receivables, which given our growth is amazing to me. So, I think our guys and we as a management team are highly focused on working capital. And going forward, I expect we're going to probably return to more consumption of working capital like you've seen historically versus over the last two or three years.\nPete Skibitski: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nLaurans Mendelson: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: I wanted to follow up, I think it was on Noah's question. So the FSG margin, I guess, either for Carlos or Eric, in terms of -- I think, Eric, you gave some relative growth parameters around the individual kind of subsegments between parts, repair and specialty products. How do you see that those relative growth rates within there influencing the margin for FSG in '25?\nEric Mendelson: I think it would help it. So I think it will help. I think the FSG margin story has been, I think, one of the least reported and yet most important things that frankly happened to this company. I mean when we look at what our operating margin basically from roughly 2015 to 2019 was in the 18% to 19% area. Now the operating margin is up in the 22% to 23% area. So we've gone up about 500 basis points over that period of time after making a number of lower-margin acquisitions and going through COVID and all the turmoil that happened there. So I think the HEICO businesses are exceptionally good at just continuing to wring efficiencies out of their operations year by year. We don't make a thing over it but they just increase the amount of volume, they focus on efficiency, they get the cost down. We don't have programs here at the corporate office like HEICO '25 or HEICO '26 or '27 or something like that. But instead, we just work with them and they do this as a matter, of course. And we just continually grind higher on the operating margin. So I think that there's no change from our perspective and what we want to continue to do. Obviously, it bounces around year-over-year, and it depends on various investments that we have to make. But I would anticipate the operating margins to continue heading north while still providing huge cost savings and benefits to our customers, and doing that not via price but via cost and volume and to what you were alluding to.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Terrific. And I don't think you specifically said on ETG, but would you expect ETG to grow revenue organically next year in '25? And is it -- if so, is it more low single-digit or mid-single-digit? Thanks.\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. This is Victor. So we expect and our budgeting for growth in the ETG next year, organically, I think we're being careful in putting it in the lower single-digits range organically with acquisitions, hopefully more than that. And we've got some great acquisitions in the pipeline as well. And look, I don't know where we'll wind up to be clear. I mean we're all that -- we're all only -- we've only finished one month of the new fiscal year. But it's my belief, based on talking to our companies and hearing from them, that the ones who felt that they came up a little short this year are being very conservative in their projection for next year. Some people call that sandbagging. I'm not going to say that or accuse them because I think it's good that our companies are conservative and they plan to spend money according to what they think they're going to see on the revenue side. But as I sit here at this moment, I'm hopeful that we'll do better than our internal budgets. But we'll see, and I don't want to commit to that at this point. And of course, just to point out, that, as it always has been throughout our existence in the ETG, it will be lumpy throughout the year. We're going to have bigger quarters than others. Some may be up. And in fact, the budgets have that, some up much more than others. And that is based upon what their expected production rates are as a result of many factors, including when the customer wants the product shipped and a variety of other factors. But I would expect that to continue in multiple ways, by the way, not just in sales and income, but as well as by end market, which we've seen historically.\nDavid Strauss: Terrific. Thanks very much and happy holidays.\nCarlos Macau: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Ron.\nRon Epstein: Yeah. A lot has been asked, but nobody really asked this one yet. So what's your expectation for maybe the change in the M&A environment with the new administration?\nEric Mendelson: Well, as you know, we've been very strong in the acquisitions area, and we bought this fiscal year five different businesses. Our teams, by the way, are busier than they've ever been, looking at a whole variety of deals in both segments, all sizes. So, for HEICO, it's been a strong market. I would anticipate, obviously people expect less scrutiny, more pro-business evaluation going forward. But I think for HEICO, we're very much a preferred buyer because we don't have some of the complications that other folks have. So, I think the regulatory environment improves, but it will still remain very good for HEICO.\nVictor Mendelson: And then one of the things to point out, of course, is that we have always been, as we said earlier in the call, a sort of a price and value-preferred supplier to our customers. We've always never pushed on the pricing button. We never pushed on like the monopoly buttons and things of that sort. And as a consequence, we've never had any issues to begin with in regulatory approvals. And of course, I think people generally expect, as Eric said, the regulatory environment to be more favorable to business and to companies like ours.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then if I kind of keep pulling on the string a little bit, what's your appetite for doing another big one? You guys have gotten bigger. And then maybe two, if you can say, it's no secret that Boeing has been shopping some stuff around. Is there anything there that you guys would be interested in?\nVictor Mendelson: Yeah. Our appetite for acquisitions of all sizes, including larger ones, remains the same. And we do larger deals. We've done them when they make sense. We won't do them just for the sake of doing them or adding revenue. It's all to us about the bottom line. So that appetite is the same as well as for smaller acquisitions, as you've seen, including small bolt-ons or fold-in acquisitions for our companies. And the opportunities, by the way, are spread out across the board. Historically, we've been an opportunistic buyer, buying everything that makes sense to buy and nothing that doesn't make sense to buy.\nEric Mendelson: And I think, Ron, if you look at Wencor, which was, of course, our largest acquisition to date, it's been an absolute home run. So I think we've proven to the market that we can execute and win and execute and assimilate these businesses and continue to generate the cash to basically get our leverage ratio back down so we can reload and do more. So I feel 100% confident in our ability to continue to do larger acquisitions.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Great. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. You too. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.\nLouis Raffetto: Hey, good morning, guys.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning, Louis.\nLouis Raffetto: Eric, just to make sure I'm level set here. So, 13% organic growth in aftermarket repair parts. Do you have MRO and specialty products for the quarter? I know MRO had been a little bit lighter. It seemed like maybe that did accelerate in the fourth quarter?\nEric Mendelson: Yeah. So MRO looks -- is about 11% in the fourth quarter and specialty products was 11% in the fourth quarter.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Perfect. Thanks you for that.\nEric Mendelson: You\u2019re welcome.\nLouis Raffetto: And then maybe, Carlos, for you. It looks like there was another small impairment and a contingency adjustment in the quarter. Just didn't know -- it looks like that actually may have negatively weighed. I don't know if that was in either or both segments or ran through corporate. Just any color there?\nCarlos Macau: Yeah. We had a small impairment to a trade name in the fourth quarter. It was about $1.5 million, just normal course of business stuff wrapping up the year. Not a big deal there. And any -- I guess you're talking about what contingency adjust -- contingent earn-out adjustments, Louis?\nLouis Raffetto: Yeah. Looks like there's $1 million -- again, both of those, I think, would be again a negative to the earnings. So I think margins would have been sort of better ex these, I'll call them sort of one-timers or you and I have talked about the contingencies. I know it's like if it's a negative, it's actually a positive long term. So just trying to square it on where that may have been.\nCarlos Macau: Yeah. So, okay -- so the trade name was in the ETG, and the -- roughly net $1 million increase in the contingent earn-out liability was split pretty much evenly between the two segments. And it's just relating to accreting that liability to terminal value. It's just the normal noise that we have every quarter for the discounted liability getting accreted to payout value. Nothing unusual there.\nLouis Raffetto: Yeah. No, it makes sense. But again, it might explain some of the questioning or look at the sequential step-down in the FSG margins, if you got even $0.5 million. I'm not sure what that works out to, but just was curious. All right, that wraps up for me. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Macau: Yeah. Just as a reminder, Louis, we have those adjustments every quarter because you can't -- I wish I could put the full earn-out value on the balance sheet on day one, but you have to fair value it and then accrete it up to payout value. So every quarter, we're going to have a little noise like that. And the fourth quarter was just normal. There was nothing unusual about those adjustments.\nLouis Raffetto: Thank you.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I will turn the conference back to Laurans Mendelson for any additional or closing remarks.\nLaurans Mendelson: I would like to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. And we look forward to our next earnings call, which would be for the first quarter of '25. Personally, I'm very optimistic about the outlook for HEICO. We see opportunity in acquisition and internal growth. And I feel that the company is doing extremely well, and it will continue to do so. So let us know if you have any other questions that we haven't answered during this call. And otherwise, we stand ready to speak to you at the end of the first quarter '25. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "I think, as we look at the Flight Support Group, it's performing as expected. We're posting between 23% and 24% operating margins pretty consistently. I think our build on that will be slight improvements as we continue to grow the base of the business. We'll get SG&A leverage on some of our fixed costs, which should be additive to the margin. Very similar to what we did a decade prior to COVID. It'll be small steps. It's not going to be ratcheted moves. And look, in the ETG, I've been saying for a while that when the mix settles out, I would expect that segment on a GAAP basis to come around the 24% margin range. And this quarter I was very pleased to see them exceed that. So, as I look into \u201825, I would expect the business to continue to be lumpy as it always has been. We'll have quarters that are higher and lower. But my baseline is around that 24% range. Thanks, Larry. This is Carlos. Just keep in mind, while we don't really have seasonality to our business, one thing Eric just pointed out is very important. Our first quarter typically with the holidays tends to be a little lighter than the second, third and fourth quarter. So just keep that in mind when you're thinking about what he just said. Yes, sure. So I don't want to give subsidiary outlook. I think that the contributions will be they're not going to be immaterial, if that's helpful. I'm being careful because we've not -- we've done recent some recent acquisitions, and I don't want to get into the subsidiary details. But on the FSG side, Wencor lapsed this quarter, and we'll have Capewell next year in the inorganic bucket the first three quarters. It won't be material to the segment. And of course, in ETG, we had three recent acquisitions that -- again, I don't think it's going to be material for the quarter. So, it's pretty much mostly organic next year. No, this is Carlos. Let me take a stab at that. So you're digging deep in my brain here. So we're down about 20 bps Q3 to Q4. I'd almost consider that a little noise. There is a little bit more amortization in the fourth quarter this year than last year, which probably contributed to that blip. There isn't a lot of -- there's not a lot of noise in either quarter for unusual things like that. I will tell you that I've been pretty open and vocal that my expectation on the FSG is that the margins go between 22% and 23%. And that's what we've done. And we're basically at 22.5% for the year. So pretty much did what I thought it would do. And I think that as we move forward, the things that I can count on other than mix shifts or something like that, would be some incremental gains in that margin due to leverage on our costs. So one thing the FSG has done very well as the revenue base has grown, they've done that without, in a very efficient manner. The SG&A spend has been down as a percent of revenue consistently all year. I expect that trend to continue, and that's really where we're going to eke out these little incremental margin gains. Again, absent any big shift in mix, that's what my expectations are going to the next year. That's absolutely correct. And no, I don't think they're going to be flat. No, I hope I didn't mean to insinuate that. What I'm insinuating is that I expect margin improvement. It's going to be -- if you look back historically, pre-COVID or the decade prior to that, our margins were growing 20 bps, 30 bps a year, and it was based on volume growth in the business. As we grow, to your point, we're not -- the cost base isn't growing as fast as revenues. I expect that to continue. And absent any big swings in mix, then that should be the cadence that we see moving forward. No, I think we typically run about 1.5% of sales or something like that in corporate expenses. I mean, as you can imagine, over the last four years, we've had tremendous inflation, things like insurance and benefits and all those things rise. We also have a little noise with FX. As the dollar weakened, we had some FX challenges. But nothing extraordinary. I mean I think the trend going forward, we should continue to be 1.4%, 1.5% of sales in that. As the company grows, we don't have lavish expenditures, but we do need arms and legs to keep track of everything. So that's principally, the zip code we'll run in. You're welcome. I mean ETG, I can do it. ETG was down low single-digits, it's like approximately 4% down for the quarter organically. And contributing to that was what we talked about earlier, the other electronics and defense offset by space. That's pretty much what happened. I think in total for the quarter, we were up 3% with some acquired growth in there, but the organic side was down roughly 4%. Thank you. Sure. So actually I think our D&A, I expect it to be very similar next year to this year. Depending on how many acquisitions we do next year, it could flux up on the A side, but as a percentage, I expect it to be roughly the same as it was this year.

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $336.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, as compared to $342.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales decrease in the fourth quarter principally reflects lower defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by increased space products net sales and the impact from our fiscal '24 acquisitions. This is in line with our expectations, as we've commented on earnings calls over the past few quarters, and is consistent with inventory destocking of some customers, particularly those in the non-aerospace and defense markets. Our defense sales growth was nicely healthy in the fiscal '24 year, though this growth varied highly by quarter, which, as you know, has historically been the case, and we anticipate the ETG's quarterly defense sales volatility will continue, but the overall trend remains positive. As expected, other electronic net sales were lower during the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 due to customer restocking. The low single-digit organic net sales decline was a much lower decline than in prior quarters and I believe recent better order flow and backlog indicate the de-stocking trends are improving. I continue to expect a return to growth in these and other electronic end markets and businesses during the first half of fiscal \u201825. The ETG's fourth quarter record backlog and strong overall orders support our optimism and as the non-A&D markets improve, we continue to anticipate growth into our next fiscal year. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $81.8 million in the fourth quarter fiscal \u201824, as compared to $86.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201823. The operating income change principally reflects a less favorable gross profit margin, mainly from the previously mentioned decreased defense and other electronics net sales, partially offset by the previously mentioned increased space products and net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin was 24.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 25.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Importantly, before acquisition-related intangibles amortization expense, our operating margin was above 28% as intangibles amortization consumes around 400 basis points of our margin. Now that's how we judge our businesses as that most closely correlates to cash. So, on what we think of as a true operating basis, these are excellent margins, and we are very pleased with it. The operating margin change principally reflects the previously mentioned less favorable gross profit margin and the lower level of SG&A efficiencies. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Thank you. Yeah. This is Victor, Noah. So it's not necessarily a one-year event to wash out the overordering, which took place over, I think, a longer period of time. It probably took place over 2, 2.5 years. But as I said in the comments, my general sense is that we start -- that reverses starts to reverse sometime in the first half of our year. And we see signs of that in a number of businesses where basically, it looks like the order rate has started to turn up in some instances and others, it's kind of bouncing along the bottom. And sometimes we get an occasional positive surprise, we end the month doing better than we expected in both sales and orders in a couple of cases recently. And just our experience has been when this happens, that sometime in the neighborhood of half a year later, it could be a little more. It could be a little less, but somewhere in that neighborhood. It starts to show up with rising sales sequentially. And so I would expect that that would play out like it typically does barring, of course, any unforeseen events, but that's what I would expect. Did we provide that? Sure. This is Victor. So we expect and our budgeting for growth in the ETG next year, organically, I think we're being careful in putting it in the lower single-digits range organically with acquisitions, hopefully more than that. And we've got some great acquisitions in the pipeline as well. And look, I don't know where we'll wind up to be clear. I mean we're all that -- we're all only -- we've only finished one month of the new fiscal year. But it's my belief, based on talking to our companies and hearing from them, that the ones who felt that they came up a little short this year are being very conservative in their projection for next year. Some people call that sandbagging. I'm not going to say that or accuse them because I think it's good that our companies are conservative and they plan to spend money according to what they think they're going to see on the revenue side. But as I sit here at this moment, I'm hopeful that we'll do better than our internal budgets. But we'll see, and I don't want to commit to that at this point. And of course, just to point out, that, as it always has been throughout our existence in the ETG, it will be lumpy throughout the year. We're going to have bigger quarters than others. Some may be up. And in fact, the budgets have that, some up much more than others. And that is based upon what their expected production rates are as a result of many factors, including when the customer wants the product shipped and a variety of other factors. But I would expect that to continue in multiple ways, by the way, not just in sales and income, but as well as by end market, which we've seen historically. And then one of the things to point out, of course, is that we have always been, as we said earlier in the call, a sort of a price and value-preferred supplier to our customers. We've always never pushed on the pricing button. We never pushed on like the monopoly buttons and things of that sort. And as a consequence, we've never had any issues to begin with in regulatory approvals. And of course, I think people generally expect, as Eric said, the regulatory environment to be more favorable to business and to companies like ours. Yeah. Our appetite for acquisitions of all sizes, including larger ones, remains the same. And we do larger deals. We've done them when they make sense. We won't do them just for the sake of doing them or adding revenue. It's all to us about the bottom line. So that appetite is the same as well as for smaller acquisitions, as you've seen, including small bolt-ons or fold-in acquisitions for our companies. And the opportunities, by the way, are spread out across the board. Historically, we've been an opportunistic buyer, buying everything that makes sense to buy and nothing that doesn't make sense to buy."

            "content": "I'm sorry. Thank you, and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO fourth quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson. Eric is HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now, before discussing our record operating results, I want to sincerely thank HEICO's talented team members for their exceptional contribution to our success. Your dedication to exceeding customer expectations and achieving operational excellence has driven outstanding results and reinforces my confidence in HEICO's future. Over the past several years, we have achieved extraordinary growth in commercial aviation, emerging stronger than ever from a very challenging period in the aerospace industry. Our team members' resilience and adaptability during this time of rapid recovery and expansion have been remarkable. Equally commendable is the agility shown by our recent acquisitions, which have seamlessly integrated into our operations and enhanced our collective success. I'm also encouraged by our progress in expanding our presence in key markets such as defense and space. These sectors are critical to long-term strategy, and our team members' commitment to delivering innovative, reliable and best-cost solutions has strengthened HEICO's reputation as a trusted partner. This focus for us for continued growth and success across diverse markets. I'll now summarize the highlights of our fourth quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO and improved by 15% and 8%, respectively, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated net income increased 35% to a record $139.7 million, or $0.99 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from a $103.4 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, improving 15% and 35%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect strong 12% organic growth, mainly attributable to increased demand for Flight Support Group's commercial aviation products and services, as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated EBITDA increased 13% to $264 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $234.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.06 times as of October 31, '24, and that was down from 3.04 times as of October 31, '23. Our excellent operating results have allowed us to early achieve the forecast we made a year ago, that our net debt to EBITDA ratio would return to a historical level of about 2 times within roughly one year to 18 months following the Wencor acquisition, and that excluded the impact of any additional acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is extremely robust with opportunities in both Flight Support and ETG, and we intend to follow our time-tested strategy of opportunistic acquisitions that continue to expand the cash-generating ability of HEICO. Cash flow provided by our operating activities increased 39% to $205.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $148.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Yesterday, HEICO's Board of Directors declared an $0.11 per share cash dividend payable in January 2025, and this represents our 93rd consecutive dividend, and this reflects their continued confidence in the strong cash flow generation of HEICO. Now, let me talk about acquisition activity. Over the past few months, our ETG Group made several strategic acquisitions, one, acquiring 70% of SVM Private Limited in November '24, they acquired 87.9% of Mid Continent Controls in October '24, and they acquired 92.5% of Marway Power Solutions in September 2024. In addition, in August '24, our Flight Support Group acquired the Aerial Delivery and Descent Devices division of Capewell Aerial Systems. All of these acquisitions were funded by using cash provided by operating activities, except for Capewell, which was principally funded using proceeds from our revolving credit facility. We expect each of these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings within the following year of acquisition. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the fourth quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric? Victor, thank you. Now as for the outlook, as we look ahead to fiscal '25, we do anticipate net sales growth in both light support and electronic technologies, driven primarily by organic growth, supported by strong demand for the majority of our products. In addition, we plan to drive growth through our recently completed acquisitions while positioning ourselves to capitalize on potential opportunities from future acquisitions and to provide new cost savings and best cost opportunities to our government in the new administration's efficiency efforts. Our priorities include continued strong new products and services development, further expanding market penetration, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, all with a strong emphasis on delivering long-term value to our shareholders. In closing, I would like to reiterate my heartfelt appreciation to our exceptional team members for their steadfast support and commitment to HEICO. Our strategy of cultivating a diverse portfolio of outstanding businesses continues to yield positive results for our shareholders. With strong key markets, fiscal '25 is poised to be another successful year. We thank you for your continued confidence in HEICO. And as I've shared before, I remain highly positive about HEICO's future. Thank you, all. And now, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Good morning. Hi, Scott. Good morning, David. Thank you. I would like to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. And we look forward to our next earnings call, which would be for the first quarter of '25. Personally, I'm very optimistic about the outlook for HEICO. We see opportunity in acquisition and internal growth. And I feel that the company is doing extremely well, and it will continue to do so. So let us know if you have any other questions that we haven't answered during this call. And otherwise, we stand ready to speak to you at the end of the first quarter '25. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Eric Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 15% to a record $691.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from $601.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and very strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects increased demands across all of our product lines. The Wencor operations continue to exceed our expectations, and we are convinced this was an excellent acquisition for HEICO. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs, which has translated into excellent growth opportunities and success for both our legacy businesses and Wencor. We continue to operate Wencor as a standalone business operation. I have defined our strategy as cooperation, capabilities and consistency without consolidation. The sales, earnings and margins proved this was the perfect strategy. As I have mentioned before, we continue to make good progress working together in serving our customers in a combined seamless fashion. Some examples of how we are working together include, one, utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all repair stations, two, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation, three, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO non-competitive PMAs, four, Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base to quote many new products, five, engineering and regulatory cooperation, six, sharing our best-in-class vendors, and seven, various back office synergies such as insurance, payroll, retirement benefits and export compliance, that will help offset additional regulatory compliance costs, such as SOX and our FAA, ODA. In many -- in addition, the FSG's defense sales continue to grow and offer an excellent opportunity. Many people have asked us what the US presidential administration change will mean for HEICO. In short, we are very excited about it. Whether it's the chance to sell more of our much lower cost alternative aircraft replacement parts to save the government and taxpayers significant money or other opportunities, the possibilities are many. HEICO has always been about finding cost savings or best cost solutions for our customers, whether they're defense or commercial customers, and not about getting the highest price out of them. Another example of the opportunity set is the components we make for missile defense systems, which is a strong and growing business for us. Missile defenses are increasingly important to the United States and our allies, with sales of these products growing dramatically amidst what is effectively a shortage of defense missiles and a very large backlog stretching over years. We expect meaningful growth from this existing backlog alone. Moving on to operating income. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 35% to $154.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth, a decrease in acquisition costs, and an improved gross margin. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin improved to 22.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, up from 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangible amortization expense consumed approximately 270 basis points of our operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, the FSG's cash margin before amortization, or what we call EBITDA, and the way we measure our businesses internally, was approximately 25.0%, which has been consistently excellent during 2024, and is 300 basis points higher than the comparable FSG cash margin of 22% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. I am extremely pleased with these results. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs and improved gross profit margin as well as a higher level of SG&A efficiencies resulting from the previously mentioned net sales growth. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the fourth quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Good morning, Larry, and thanks for your question. First of all, we -- as you pointed out, we're very happy with the Wencor acquisition. It has been immensely successful and exceeded all of our wildest expectations. Number one, starting with the people, they are outstanding. They really fit the HEICO culture. The companies are very similar, and the businesses are working extremely well together. We're in a unique situation that all of our aftermarket businesses are running, of course, at record numbers, performing exceptionally well. And they are so busy just trying to accomplish what they've each got in their backlog in terms of getting the parts out the door and developing all this new stuff that we've just left them alone right now. I do think that there is an additional opportunity in further cooperation and going to the customers with a bigger basket. But as of now, I mean, you can see with these kinds of results, 12% organic growth, 13% in the aftermarket. Following a tremendous deal like that, that beats what anybody thought was possible. So we're very, very happy with that. But we do think that there are additional opportunities. Our teams are working very closely together in the parts and repair side to harvest those opportunities. We've already been very successful by putting all of the HEICO and the Wencor PMAs as well as the HEICO and Wencor DER repairs together. So our repair stations can focus on particular unit and really drive costs down and service levels up to the customer. And we've been very successful in that, and we anticipate continued success in that area. So yes, I think as I said internally, I think Wencor is going to be the gift that keeps on giving, not only because of Wencor, but because of the HEICO legacy businesses and really being the perfect fit there and just going so well. We -- that's a great question, and we are extremely excited about this opportunity. This is real simple low-hanging fruit. I mean DOGE is something I think everybody in the country realizes that we've got to spend our dollars more wisely and HEICO offers various solutions without getting into the specifics because we have our competitors on the call and I welcome them to it but of course we can't lay out a roadmap for them of what we're going to do. But needless to say, I think there is a tremendous amount of low-hanging fruit. HEICO was working on all of this before the election. And so we were very hopeful that there would be a number of breakthroughs. We are still hopeful of that. And DOGE just pours more fuel on the fire. When you look at the budget deficit and the amount of money that has to be cut, there are tremendous cost savings opportunities. And we think that it's not only cost, but there's also, and without, I have to be very careful because of course I don't want to provide a roadmap to our competitors, but there are a number of areas whereby, in particular, in the development of new products where HEICO can offer increased quality and by the way that's not just the tagline, that's proven and through various rig tests, increased quality, better development timelines, and lower cost. So I think DOGE is going to be outstanding for us. Now, having said that, you asked is this going to be short, medium, or long term, I think it's going to be more medium-term. I mean in the short-term the government has its money committed, so that's going to be what it is. But I do feel that this is just additional clarity and legs for HEICO as we move forward. But I expect the opportunities to be very, very substantial because it's just not only about price. Yes. So, as far as what percentage goes to the DoD, I don't have that information in front of me, but I can tell you that defense is approximately a quarter of the FSG sales. So you get an idea there. In terms of the opportunity, we -- the opportunity is not only in the areas that you mentioned, but yes, we have come up with a list. We are aware of what the opportunities could be. Of course, I don't want to -- I can't outline it on the call, but we are -- it is quite substantial. And the government really should be should be saving these dollars. Absolutely, yeah. We've got very broad manufacturing capabilities at HEICO and we are focusing on Wencor's robust new product development in terms of manufacturing that stuff within various HEICO businesses. There is an opportunity to resource some of the existing business. As long as our vendors treat us right and are fair with us, we're very loyal to them. So they have nothing to worry about. And frankly, the new pipeline is so robust that it will really keep our shops very busy. But again, we think the opportunity is really very, very strong in that area. Thank you, and happy holidays to you too, Scott. Good morning. Yeah. I -- no, I don't think there's any reason you shouldn't see it. We're very optimistic on our three disaggregated revenue bucket of parts, repair and specialty products, they're all very strong. And so I think that that is -- a double-digit expectation is reasonable. I mean, of course, we're only 45 days into the year. So we always want to be a little circumspect and always at the end of the year between Thanksgiving and the New Year, volumes can be skewed one way or the other depending on shipments from our vendors to us and then what the customers want and the way they manage their inventory. So I don't like to take the months of November and December in order to prognosticate the rest of the year. But yeah, our internal numbers are for double-digit organic growth within the Flight Support and again, very strong in all three of our segments. Yeah. And always November and December, I mean, for the 35 years I've been at the company, November and December are historically lower types of months. And January is always the month that drives the first quarter. So of course, we're not yet in January, so it's hard to say. But our internal numbers are very optimistic, and our business heads are extremely optimistic and frankly, more optimistic than I've ever seen them. Yeah. So number one, I have tremendous respect for the airframe and the engine OEMs. They're phenomenal companies. They build incredible products. But unfortunately, they are at the -- they're dependent on their supply chains. And those supply chains, as we know, got terribly beat up through COVID, as many companies slash their orders, and the people are just not at the suppliers. So they talk about increasing the production rates, and I think that's the intent. And marginally, they have in some areas, but I think they've had a lot of challenges. And I can tell you, I go around to our businesses, and I see the supply chain challenges that exist, and they are still tremendous. So I personally am not putting any money down that the supply from the OEM suppliers is going to turn around substantially. I have not seen evidence of that. So I expect the aftermarket to continue to remain very strong. And I think airlines have been bitten so badly by the deferrals that they don't want to get in the situation where they don't have the legacy assets to be able to complete their routes and their schedule. So, I expect them to continue to spend money, I mean not foolishly, but they've got to always have a backup plan. And that's why I think the aftermarket is going to be strong. In addition, if you look even with the OEM deliveries increasing, if you look at the available seat miles and what IATA predicted, I mean 8% available seat miles increasing in 2025. This is a huge number. And frankly, it would be very easy to absorb the additional seats and keep the older aircraft in service. So we -- based on the order trends that we see, it remains very, very strong for the legacy aircraft. So, I, at this moment, don't see a change there. Thank you. Good morning. They don't have a process. As Carlos says, they don't have a box to check. And what the airlines had to have, and this is what we worked on 35 years ago. When I first went into the airlines and showed them what we could do and said we could develop all these additional stuff, they said to me, that's a great idea, but we can't buy PMA parts. And I said, well, what do you mean, you're already buying our combustion chambers where the fuel and air is mixed and burned, and we've supplied those parts to you for 20 years with a flawless service record, why can't you should be able to buy these additional parts and this is the process that we're going to use with the FAA, and frankly, this is the box that you have to check, and that's been immensely successful. So I think the government must change. This cannot be business as usual. The United States cannot continue to irresponsibly run at these budget deficits. And there is no reason if a part is good enough for the President or the Vice President or senators or representatives or the Secretary of Defense to fly on when they fly commercially, maybe the President doesn't, but everybody else certainly does when they fly commercially, but it can't be used for the DoD. That is nonsense. It's a relic of the past. And I think the government recognizes this is low-hanging fruit. This must change. And frankly, HEICO is the one to do it. And we've got a lot of opportunities. I need to be very careful. And obviously, you know us well, and I don't want to get into details on specifically what, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the opportunity here. And we think it's very substantial. And I just want to add that we still think that the current providers are going to continue to do very well. And HEICO provides products to the DoD, and there's still tremendous number of products out there and not everything lends itself to what we can provide. But I think what we can provide is very significant for HEICO. I think that there is a very large opportunity in both. On the commercial derivatives, this is a no-brainer. I mean, this is just -- it's a no-brainer. And again, they already use some of the parts. So it's not that they're fundamentally opposed, it's just they need that box to check. And then when you go outside of the commercial derivatives, there are also significant savings opportunities that can occur. And we think that there are very large opportunities there as well. But again, I don't want to over commit because these are not short term -- this is not a fiscal 2025 impact. This obviously comes later, but I think it's a very nice add-on to all of the good stuff that we're currently doing. Same to you. Well, first of all, good morning, Sheila, and thank you for your questions. We are very optimistic on the continued growth, as I mentioned in all of the segments. In breaking down our organic growth, the parts side definitely had the highest organic growth in 2024. And the area with the lowest organic growth was our specialty products. We think that in 2025, based on backlogs that we already have in the specialty products area that our organic growth is going to accelerate in that area, and it will remain a strong double-digits within the parts side. Component repair is probably going to be somewhat in between those. But we also anticipate, I would say strong, I'd say double-digit growth, and I am expecting double-digit growth, frankly, in all three of our disaggregated areas, the parts, component repair and specialty products. Yeah. So, specifically with regard to Wencor, if you take a look at our organic growth within parts and component repair, you'll see that there's approx -- there's over $60 million, approximately $62 million, of organic growth in the fourth quarter in just parts and repair. That's all organic. And remember, we owned Wencor basically for the pretty much the entire fourth quarter of last year. For HEICO and Wencor to grow $60 million organically, no acquisitions, that's huge, and frankly, far beyond anything that I thought was ever possible. We've got incredible teams, incredible leaders in these businesses. I think HEICO's competitive advantage is the way that we have these businesses structured, where we have them as individual business units, each with its own business head and its own leadership team, combined with central sales forces to be able to help them get out there. There is a tremendous amount of unsold potential. There is so much more help that we can give our customers and it's just a matter of getting out there or getting in front of them and making sure that they switch from their old legacy solution into a new HEICO solution. So, I expect the future to be very strong, and I'm very encouraged. And when I go out and talk to our folks, so are they. When I look also into the specialty products, when we look at what our backlogs are in these areas, they're tremendous. And now really the challenge is executing and getting product from the vendors out there in the field and subcontractors, because the market is incredibly tight. I don't go to any businesses where they say, yeah, we're all caught up, everything is back to 2019, not a prayer. The labor force has changed. The -- it's very difficult to be able to ramp. And so that's why I'm very bullish in all of our areas. You had asked about the military side. I think that's just added opportunity, because we've spoken about it, that for years HEICO has operated in that area, and we've had limited success. But as a result of the comments that I made in the prior couple of questions, I think this is really low-hanging fruit for HEICO. And the government got to make cost savings an imperative. And the new administration certainly is doing that to a degree that we've never seen before in the history of this country. And it's wise that they do so because, as a country, we're running out of money. And HEICO can provide, again, not only the cost savings as a result of using our parts or using our technology, but also when these systems are developed by the government, there's a tremendous approach which slows things down. And I'm really very excited for DOGE because I think they can accelerate a lot of these processes. And HEICO is going to be, I think, a tremendous beneficiary across our Flight Support as well as our Electronic Technologies business because we are smaller businesses that are competitively focused in various areas, lower cost, higher quality. We can get it done quickly. And if the government wants it fast, I believe it's a huge opportunity for us. Yeah. I think -- look, the administrations have always been supportive. The FAA has been frankly outstanding to work with over the last 35 years. I expect that to continue. I don't expect a change there. If you will, the civilian workforce has been great to work with. So I expect everything continuing and no change in our ability to get PMAs. We've gotten more PMAs than ever, and I expect that to continue. Thanks, Sheila. Hey, Scott. Good morning. Yeah. The internal numbers I've got are really strong over in specialty products. As I've mentioned, really the key is being able to get products out of certain suppliers. But I think from what we're seeing and based on what the budgets are and everything, at least 10% organic growth seems to be very reasonable. And when you think of it, I know that on a spreadsheet, and I think everybody appreciates it's on a spreadsheet, it's easy. You put in point one, and it's easy to type that in. But when you think about this, when a business grows organically by 10% a year, it doubles in seven years, quadruples in 14 years. And these businesses to accomplish a 10% growth rate, I think that's just tremendous and incredible in this market that we've got with constrained material and constrained labor. So I'm very optimistic in those areas. Yeah. I think on HEICO parts they're pretty hand-to-mouth. They certainly don't tell us when they have a surplus. I'm not aware of any material oversupplies at the airlines. I mean they're all wanting these parts very badly. There are always puts and takes with that, but I think it's all very strong. Also, since HEICO has got a really good delivery program and we're able to supply so many of these parts in the month of order, airlines are -- they don't typically have to overstock our parts because they can rely on us pretty well. Thanks. And happy holidays to you too. Good morning, Noah. Good. Happy holidays to you too. Good morning. Yeah. I mean, a couple of things. Number one, I should state that one of the metrics that we never look at HEICO in any of the businesses is sequential growth rate. Because things can move around, they can bounce around and that can exaggerate it. The number that we always look at is the annual growth rates are compared to what we've done in the prior year. And when I look at our FSG organic growth, I mean, basically, it was approximately in the first quarter, 12%. Second quarter, 12%. Third quarter, 15%. And fourth quarter, 12%. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's out of the park, that is phenomenal, and is so far above what anybody else does in this industry with regard to organic growth. So I'm super happy with it. And we just don't look, I mean, compare one quarter to the next. I mean if we didn't get overly excited when between basically the second quarter to the third quarter, we had big sequential growth, I mean that can be due to various deals or all sorts of stuff. I mean, what's more important is the comparison to the annual. And we think that, that is incredibly strong. And sometimes these moves and the numbers move in various jumps. So it's really dangerous to look at it in a sequential basis like that. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Pete. I think it would help it. So I think it will help. I think the FSG margin story has been, I think, one of the least reported and yet most important things that frankly happened to this company. I mean when we look at what our operating margin basically from roughly 2015 to 2019 was in the 18% to 19% area. Now the operating margin is up in the 22% to 23% area. So we've gone up about 500 basis points over that period of time after making a number of lower-margin acquisitions and going through COVID and all the turmoil that happened there. So I think the HEICO businesses are exceptionally good at just continuing to wring efficiencies out of their operations year by year. We don't make a thing over it but they just increase the amount of volume, they focus on efficiency, they get the cost down. We don't have programs here at the corporate office like HEICO '25 or HEICO '26 or '27 or something like that. But instead, we just work with them and they do this as a matter, of course. And we just continually grind higher on the operating margin. So I think that there's no change from our perspective and what we want to continue to do. Obviously, it bounces around year-over-year, and it depends on various investments that we have to make. But I would anticipate the operating margins to continue heading north while still providing huge cost savings and benefits to our customers, and doing that not via price but via cost and volume and to what you were alluding to. Good morning, Ron. Well, as you know, we've been very strong in the acquisitions area, and we bought this fiscal year five different businesses. Our teams, by the way, are busier than they've ever been, looking at a whole variety of deals in both segments, all sizes. So, for HEICO, it's been a strong market. I would anticipate, obviously people expect less scrutiny, more pro-business evaluation going forward. But I think for HEICO, we're very much a preferred buyer because we don't have some of the complications that other folks have. So, I think the regulatory environment improves, but it will still remain very good for HEICO. And I think, Ron, if you look at Wencor, which was, of course, our largest acquisition to date, it's been an absolute home run. So I think we've proven to the market that we can execute and win and execute and assimilate these businesses and continue to generate the cash to basically get our leverage ratio back down so we can reload and do more. So I feel 100% confident in our ability to continue to do larger acquisitions. Thank you. You too. Thank you. Good morning, Louis. Yeah. So MRO looks -- is about 11% in the fourth quarter and specialty products was 11% in the fourth quarter. You're welcome."

I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Samara, thank you very much and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO third quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now before reviewing our operating results, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for their contribution to our record-setting performance. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence translated into excellent results for our shareholders. And I continue to be very optimistic about the future of HEICO. Over the past 16 quarters we've experienced incredible growth in our commercial aviation markets after emerging from one of the darkest times in aerospace history when air travel slowed to a crawl amid COVID-19 pandemic. I couldn't be prouder of the professionalism and tenacity of our team members, who demonstrated serving our customers during this period of rapid growth. Their ability to meet the challenge of accelerated growth is commendable, and this includes the remarkable Wencor team members who joined HEICO family last year. In addition, I am pleased with the progress and effort of our team members have made serving customers in the defense industry. It is my expectation that growth in this global industry will continue despite who wins the upcoming elections, and the softer results we realized over the past few years appear to be in the rearview mirror. And now I'd like to summarize the highlights of our third quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO and improved by 45% and 37%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter fiscal '23. I think you' all agree that those are outstanding results. Consolidated net income increased 34% to a record $136.6 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '24. And that was up from $102 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the third quarter of fiscal '24, improving 68% and 72%, respectively, over the third quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect strong 15% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand for the Flight Support Group's commercial aerospace products and services and the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated EBITDA increased 45% to $261.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $179.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.11x as of July 31, '24. That was down from 3.04 times as of October 31, '23. Our excellent operating results have allowed us to early-achieve the forecast we made a year ago that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would return to historical level of about 2 times within roughly one year to 18 months following the Wencor acquisition. And that's excluding any impact of further acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is extremely robust with opportunities in both Flight Support and ETG, and we intend to follow our time-tested strategy of opportunistic acquisitions that continue to expand the cash generating ability of HEICO. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 47% to $214 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $145.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. In July '24, we increased our regular semi-annual cash dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share. This represented our 92nd consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. I'd like to now discuss our recent acquisition activity. You may recall, in December '23, we announced the acquisition of exclusive perpetual licenses and certain assets from Honeywell International to support the Boeing 737NG and the 777 cockpit display and legacy displays product lines which that group has been performing extremely well for us. As a result, in May '24, we completed a second transaction with Honeywell International, under which we acquired additional licenses and certain assets to further enhance the manufacturing of these new products, including screens or military variant of the Boeing 737NG and 777 cockpit displays and legacy displays product lines. Last week, we announced that Flight Support Group acquired the aerial delivery and descent divisions of Capewell Aerial Systems. Purchase price of this acquisition was paid in cash, principally using proceeds from our revolving credit facility. And we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings within the first-year following the acquisition. At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the third quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 68% to a record $681.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from $405 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal 2023 and 2024 acquisitions, and strong 15% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects increased demand across all of our product lines. As we continue to experience excellent organic growth within the FSG, we've also been highly successful in supplementing growth through acquisitions. Last week, we acquired Capewell, a Connecticut-based leading provider of proprietary aircraft cockpit, emergency egress and aerial delivery products for both the commercial aerospace and defense markets. I am very impressed with their manufacturing process and strict adherence to high reliability and quality products, which help ensure pilot troop safety worldwide. They also have an excellent staff of people who will fit extremely well within the HEICO family. The Wencor operations continued to exceed our expectations, and we are convinced this was an excellent investment for HEICO. Wencor's entrepreneurial culture and a record of producing high quality products continues to produce wins in the marketplace. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs. We continue to operate Wencor as a stand-alone business operation. However, we have made very good progress in working together and serving our customers in a combined seamless fashion. Some examples of how we are now working together include: one, utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all of our repair stations. Two, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation. Three, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO noncompetitive PMAs. Four, Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base, in particular, our specialty products and Electronic Technologies Group, to quote new products. Five, engineering and regulatory cooperation. Six, sharing best-in-class vendors. And seven, driving various back-office synergies, such as payroll and export compliance, that will help offset the cost of additional regulatory compliance, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and HEICO's FAA ODA program. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 72% to a record $153.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 up from $89.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in intangible asset amortization expense. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 22.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from 22.0% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition related intangible amortization expense consumed approximately 270 basis points of our operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal '24, the FSG's cash margin before amortization, or EBITA was approximately 25.2%, which is excellent in absolute terms and is 180 basis points higher than the comparable Flight Support Group cash margin of 23.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. I am extremely pleased with these results. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, as well as lower acquisition costs, partially offset by the previously mentioned higher intangible asset amortization expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Victor?\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $322.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to $325.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The slight net sales decrease principally reflects lower other electronics and medical products net sales, partially offset by increased defense, space and aerospace products net sales. This is in line with our expectations as we've commented on our earnings conference calls over the last few quarters and is consistent with inventory destocking at some customers. We continue to anticipate quarterly volatility in the ETG's defense net sales, but the overall trend remains very positive. As expected, other electronic net sales were lower during the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the third quarter of fiscal '23. We believe these order trends in these markets have bottomed, and we are seeing improved orders in some of our companies in these other markets. These other markets typically equate to between 25% and 30% of our sales. We continue to expect an overall return to growth in these end-markets and businesses during the first half of fiscal '25. The ETG's record backlog and strong overall orders support our optimism, and as the non-A&D markets improve, we expect a healthy tailwind into our next fiscal year. Orders for commercial aviation and defense products have been very robust, and we are very pleased with our business' performance, like at Exxelia, which continues to be a strong acquisition, meeting our performance expectations including growing its profit margins. Further, our order book and quotation activity for fiscal 2026 is building nicely. And I did mean to say fiscal '26, in addition to '25, of course which augments our optimism for later periods as well. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved 23.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from 22.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. I'd also note that before acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses, our operating margin was above 27% as those intangibles amortization expenses consume around 400 basis points of our margin. And that's how we judge our businesses as that most closely correlates to our cash. So when we look at how our businesses are doing on an operating basis, we are very pleased with the overall margins and their continued improvement. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, partially offset by lower level of SG&A efficiencies. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we remain optimistic about achieving net sales growth for both FSG and ETG. This growth is expected to be largely fueled by the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions, along with sustained demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, we are committed to ongoing product and service innovation, further market penetration, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In conclusion, I want to again express my gratitude to the exceptional team members for their unwavering support and dedication to HEICO. Our strategy of building a diversified portfolio of outstanding businesses continues to deliver positive outcomes for our shareholders. Our key markets are very strong, and in fiscal '24, is shaping up to be another successful year. Thank you as shareholders for your continued trust. And as I mentioned before, I remain very optimistic about the future for HEICO. And now we'll open the floor to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, good morning, and a very nice quarter.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much Rob, good morning to you.\nRobert Spingarn: A couple -- I thought I'd start with the end-markets. And Eric, FSG's organic growth rate accelerated relative to the prior two quarters. And I was wondering, does this reflect the maturing integration that you just talked about between HEICO and Wencor? Or is this simply a function of the market, maybe demand strengthening in the end-market and aftermarket?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think that's a great question, Rob, and I spent a lot of time in business reviews and with our sales folks, in particular, over the last month going over a lot of the details. There is no question that the market remains strong. But I do think the reason why the incredible 17% growth rate was so outstanding is because of really two factors. One, we continue to win in the marketplace. And HEICO is an accumulation or a combination of a lot of individual businesses working as hard as they can, planning years in advance, developing these products, having them on the shelf and being able to hit the demand and get them sold when the market needs them. So I think that's number one. Really, everybody's sort of, if you will, all the unsung heroes who are working their rear ends off every day to make this happen. So that's probably the first reason. The second would definitely be due to the addition of Wencor and the broadening of our product line. I think in speaking with our customers, we\u2019re viewed as a much more complete supplier. I mean, HEICO today has transitioned tremendously over the last many decades. And I think our customers are very confident in purchasing additional products from us, whether it is parts, distribution, PMA, repair. And I think we are growing our market share. So it's really, I think, yes, a strong market, but more I think really focusing on the detail by our businesses and the broadening of the product-line through Wencor and the 737 and 777 display unit acquisitions.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then notwithstanding the strong growth, there have been some airlines out there talking about overcapacity that's been a bit of a theme here. Are you seeing any evidence of that in the order patterns so far?\nEric Mendelson: No, we really don't, actually. And as a matter of fact, the number of airlines have sort of trimmed back their purchases. They, if you will, in hindsight, I think over-ordered a bit in 2023, took more than they needed in 2023. So we do have anecdotal evidence of certain customers cutting back this year. But that was really offset by strength at other customers. So I think we continue to do very well. And that really -- that gets to the sort of the beauty of the HEICO model in that we've got all these individual business units who have -- who control their own destiny. And if they are short in one area, they figure out how to make it up in another area, and this doesn't roll up to my desk after the fact and instead they are doing this real time. So in summary, no I mean, the market for us remains quite strong.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just on the OE side, both you and Victor have some exposure to commercial OE. Are you seeing any slowdown in orders on the OE side because of the slower than expected production ramps both at Airbus and Boeing? Or do you continue to ship at the higher target rates and they are just taking inventory?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, we've definitely seen a reduction off of forecast due to their build rates. There is no question Airbus is doing, I think, better than Boeing in that area. But yes, definitely on the commercial OE production, things are softer than expected. That, of course has been offset by our strength in the defense side, and we expect that strength to continue into 2025, 2026 and after based on our conversations with our customers and what they want there.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then here is a question, Larry I thought I would ask you this question, but anybody please jump in. You continue to be acquisitive. You just did another deal. How would you characterize the M&A pipeline as it stands today maybe relative to the prior year or so? And is there any change in behavior from private equity folks who are out there with properties to sell?\nEric Mendelson: Rob, this is Eric. I'll take that just for a moment. Of course, a year ago, we were largely focused on Wencor is our largest deal in the history of the company, over $2 billion and that consumed a tremendous amount of capital as well as effort. So -- but I can tell you that our pipeline today remains incredibly robust. We have a lot of projects in the work. Our acquisitions teams are nonstop running around the country. I think we worked very hard to differentiate ourselves as the buyer of choice. And we'll keep our fingers crossed that some of these will come to fruition. But there is no question that in conversations, and I don't want to call out individual businesses because they have their own respective sellers and reasons for having dealt with us. But I can tell you that on all of our recent acquisitions I think HEICO's reputation has been key to getting all of those deals done and has made us a particularly attractive counterparty for our sellers and partners. And the pipeline remains very, very strong.\nLaurans Mendelson: Rob, I know -- this is Larry. I know you asked me the question, but Eric pre-empted me. So what he told you is accurate. The pipeline is very full. And we are looking at actually too many acquisitions right now. It's taking full time of the staff and it's -- we're looking more for nonprivate equity deals. That's more in our best interest, although we do see some private equity. The problem is they are priced very high. And when we try to compete, normally, we can't compete because of the pricing. But we have enough non-private equity deals really to fill all that we need. So for us, it's a buyer's market right now.\nRobert Spingarn: Got it. Got it. And just quickly, Carlos, if I could ask you what the blended organic growth rate was in the quarter. Thank you.\nCarlos Macau: You're talking about for the company as a whole?\nRobert Spingarn: Yes. So when you factor all in, yes.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. So all in, it was a tick over 7% organic growth for the whole company.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, excellent. Thank you all.\nCarlos Macau : Thank you Rob.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning and thank you for the questions.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning Bert.\nBert Subin: Maybe, Eric just to start with you on the FSG side. I think you mentioned sort of accelerating growth, organic growth of 15%, extremely impressive. Last quarter, you had talked about the aftermarket replacement parts side being, I believe, 21% growth, and you called out about one-fourth of that being priced with the discount relative to OEM being close to the widest you've ever seen it. So I'm curious, how did that change in the fiscal third quarter? Was pricing increases an element of that growth? Or does it continue to be more of a volume story?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Hi Bert. So the short answer, it's more of a volume story. I think last -- so this quarter, it was 17% for the parts business. And last quarter, I think it was 21%, as you mentioned. Most of that is volume. Some of it is price, but I would say it is definitely mostly on the volume side. We've been very firm about passing along our price increases to our customers. And we've got to make sure as our costs have gone up and whether that's labor or special processes, material, purchased product, whatever it is -- we've got to make sure that we get that passed along. So definitely, the vast majority of that is volume and then a much lesser extent would be the price.\nBert Subin: Eric, as you think forward for FS -- I guess, just for the aftermarket replacement parts business, I know it was brought up earlier on the airline side, you are seeing trimming capacity, lower yields. It doesn't sound like that's had any impact yet. Do you think there is an opportunity to gain meaningful share if we go into a little bit of a slowdown just because it opens up or, I guess makes the portfolio more attractive to customers that maybe bought PMA parts in sort of a lower percentage? Or do you think that becomes sort of the element where pricing maybe balances with volume? Just curious how you're thinking about maybe the next several quarters if things do slow down.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Again we haven't seen signs of any slowdown to-date. As a matter of fact, quite the contrary, sort of surprisingly to the contrary. And with regard to normally when there is a slowdown, obviously volumes drop, and that is when we pick up additional market share. That's when customers realize that they've got to take advantage of our additional cost savings, parts and repairs. And we pick up market share at that point. And then of course, when the economy recovers, we recover even stronger than most because we've picked up market share. The customers are very, I think very excited about the HEICO product line. They want to have competition, they are demanding competition, and HEICO provides very fair competition in that regard. So I think that we are going to do very well and, for sure pick up market share, get additional parts and repairs designed when that -- if that occurs.\nBert Subin: Very helpful. And just one last question for Victor. Victor, if we look at the ETG business over the last several quarters, sort of bounced around from positive to negative on the organic side, sort of averaged about 0%. I think that business is meant to be sort of longer term low to mid-single-digit organic. I guess sort of a two-part question. One, I think earlier in the year, you were expecting this more significant ramp in the back half. I'm just curious what changed that outlook? And then two, as you go into FY '25 is there a potential that growth sort of exceed your longer-term growth target just as a function of recovering?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Thank you, Bert. They are good questions. I don't think where we are and so far in the back half of the year has really been a surprise to us. I think we tried to hint in the second quarter call that we thought, for example margins were higher in that period that we would look for an average over the course of the year. So it is not really too far out of line, maybe slightly. We are doing the budgets for fiscal '25. But when I look at our backlogs and I look at our order rate, it feels to me as though we would have a stronger growth rate in fiscal 2025. Again, it's a little premature for me to say that with certainty because our companies do their budgets now and submit them in early October. So I'm waiting on those. But right now, that's how it feels to me, yes.\nBert Subin: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nLarry Solow: Thanks so much. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking the questions and congrats on really impressive growth and even, Victor, it sounds like some good bookings growth for your side of the business. So it looks like we'll be having, hopefully, some good couple of quarters upcoming. I guess a question, Eric for you, just a couple -- thank you for some of that detail on the Wencor. So it sounds like you are certainly getting, it looks like, some revenue synergies and stuff combining a lot of common services and whatnot. I'm just curious like, I don't know if you could break this out, but has your organic growth at Wencor kept up or even exceeded sort of the overall growth of FSG over the last few quarters?\nEric Mendelson: I would say it is very consistent with FSG. I mean we look at the various Wencor businesses, and their organic growth is very consistent. I mean some are -- there can be little anomalies here or there. But in general, they are doing very well and consistent with the legacy HEICO businesses.\nLarry Solow: And has the overall -- obviously, the PMA parts offering has increased -- one plus one certainly equals two. But has it increased even more? Have you increased your overall offering apart? Does that help growth in the last few quarters?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it has. And the overall offering has grown. And we've really seen the advantages of that, and frankly, the customer enthusiasm around it.\nLarry Solow: Got you. Just a question, well it sounds like the Capewell acquisition, a nice little tuck-in. Any more color on that? It looks like, I guess, it is going to be in specialty products, so a little more niche, higher margin stuff, maybe a little bit more some choppy sales, bigger quarters sometimes, right? Is that how to look at that kind of --.\nEric Mendelson: It is a terrific business, and they basically have two main product lines. One is the commercial and military -- I'm sorry, the commercial and military aerial descent business. So basically, when you are -- the cockpit egress business, you need to have basically a way out of the cockpit in case the cockpit door is blocked, or also cargo aircraft or tankers need egress from the aircraft in the event of a problem. And they have a very sophisticated, well time-tested, appreciated product, which is in a number of commercial and military aircraft, which is really key and really the only way to get people out of the aircraft in the event they need to escape. And the standard slides are either inactive or don't exist on certain types of aircraft. So that's part of their business. And then the other part of their business is the area of descent piece, whether you're parachuting out of an airplane or if they're dropping tanks or various equipment, the C130s or C-17s or whatever it is, you've got fairly sophisticated parachutes that attach to it, and there are various attachment mechanisms and aerial drop mechanisms, which are really critical. So we think that this is a great business. It's really appreciated by its customers, and frankly, is the pioneer in this business and since the 1940s was the original company that designed the device, which permit paratroopers to jump out of airplanes and to detach once they hit the ground and not get dragged as a result of the parachute. And so that's a very strong business. It's a very nichey business, and that's why we thought it fit very well in our Specialty Products Group. And of course, our specialty products has a lot of connection to the overall -- to the other parts of Flight Support. So I think it's a very good fit. We're very excited about it.\nLarry Solow: Excellent. I guess just last question, maybe pass to Carlos. Just on the margin, you mentioned, respectively, on the FSG and ETG up to 25% and 27% on the cash operating margin. Perhaps not so much in the next quarter or two, but where do you see those margins over the next three to five years? I mean can they continue to pick up on the cash side you look at?\nCarlos Macau: So the answer to your question is, as we continue to grow the volume of the business, we do expect to eke out incremental margin gains consistent with our history. As the base of the business grows, the amount of overhead needed to support it is relative to that growth, it's a little lower. So I expect we'll get that. If you look back, I've quoted this before, if you look back a decade, and look at the margin gains, that's kind of what I would expect going forward once we sell into our footprint here in the FSG and ETG. And I do think you're talking about an EBITA margin, so it's pretty elevated, we were happy with it this quarter. And I think that as we move forward, that should continue to stabilize and eke out improvements.\nLarry Solow: Great. Excellent, thanks everybody.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Thanks good morning Larry, Eric, Victor, Carlos. Nice results. Victor, could you talk a little bit about -- you talked about some of the booking rates and sort of the confidence, and you start to seeing ETG growth thinking about next year. But just maybe some of the end-markets that you are seeing, is defense, I assume it's almost 50% of your segment, is that growing mid-single digits and it's just other areas that are seeing some softness? Or maybe just a little more color there. Thanks.\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. So Peter, the defense part of the business and commercial aviation really have been extremely strong, experiencing double-digit growth. And again that is where some of our longer-term bookings really come on the defense side. And seeing some of those fill out beyond '25, as well as some of the quote activity in the order indications, again, to 2025 and beyond. So right now, I feel like defense is a good leader for us. And commercial aviation has really been phenomenal. So when I take that together, I look at the other markets, which are down consistent with, I think, what other people are seeing in these kinds of markets, and it looks like those order rates are bottoming out. It appears to us that our customers have kind of used up the excess inventory and the orders are coming in, and if you add a sort of six month lead time on that -- it gets us into fiscal '25. And that's why I say I feel like there will be a very nice tailwind from that next year. Of course, I can't be certain on that, but that's just how it feels right now.\nCarlos Macau: Hi, Peter, this is Carlos. I just want to point out, you are not wrong on what you said about 50% of the segment. But right now, we're tracking around 40%. So we still have -- I've mentioned in the past, once the mix sort of settles down, I do expect our defense to become closer to the 50% number over time. Right now, we are still a little behind on the total revenues in the segment being only around 40% for defense this quarter.\nPeter Arment: Okay. That's helpful. And then just, Carlos, maybe just sticking with you, on the leverage, it is come down exactly where you guys kind of thought it would, to 2.1 turns. How are you thinking about just given that the M&A pipeline is full, but your ability to kind of want to still delever, what's -- any updated thoughts on kind of where you're taking the leverage to?\nCarlos Macau: Well, I think, look -- we -- by nature, we're an acquisitive company, and we set out an aggressive timetable to pay down some of the debt that we had, and we've done that. I think the opportunities are abound. As long as we can keep our leverage candidly under three, there is opportunities for us. And I think that the goal for us is to find very profitable companies that don't disrupt that leverage, the ones that have real high EBITDA, which has been our history, right? I mean we like high margin businesses. So the more acquisitions we do with the higher margin, the less impact it has on our leverage. And that's where I'm steering things when we talk internally about these deals.\nPeter Arment: Terrific, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about working capital. Last year, you had a fairly big inventory build. This year, fairly big inventory build. How are you thinking about potentially slower growth or working capital or maybe working capital just coming down on an absolute basis from here?\nEric Mendelson: Hi, David, this is Eric. I'll start out with sort of the big picture and then Carlos will get into the specifics on the financial. HEICO has always been focused on customer service, making sure that we capture all of the incremental sales that we can capture. And if you look at coming out of COVID, HEICO recovered much quicker than most. And as a result of not cutting our people, not trimming our inventories too much, and bottom-line, we were able to support the market when others weren't. And that's really been a huge HEICO advantage. So I can tell you from an operational perspective, Victor and I are very, very focused on all of our business units, reviewing working capital, understanding specifically how the inventory or the receivables have increased. Obviously, receivables, that's up due to the huge increase in sales. But with regard to inventory, our businesses have been really outstanding in terms of having the correct inventory on the shelf. There are a lot of companies where their inventory blows up and they've got the wrong stuff on the shelf and they can't sell it, and then people find out after the fact that it's a problem. HEICO has always been very, very careful not to do that. And as a result, we have very, very robust inventory reserve policies to make sure that we are being very proactive and we make sure that we have the right inventory. So I think that there is no question that there is a big internal focus on inventory. We want to slow the growth. But it is really key to our business. And frankly, when you look at the 17% organic growth that we had in the aftermarket business, I mean that was really outstanding, and that can only be accomplished through increased inventories. But Carlos will get into the specifics for you.\nCarlos Macau: I don't know how much more I could add to that. I would say that the rate of increase in inventory spend has come down relative to the growth in the business. I mean, our sales are, for the quarter, up 37% comparatively and our use -- our inventory spend is not ramping at that pace. So I'm happy with that. I think what I mentioned earlier in the year, David, was that we had a fair amount of orders outstanding on firm commitment inventory that some of our subsidiaries had made two years ago just because of lead times. And so we made good on those. We are not the type of company that disrupts our vendor base or does bad things to our vendor base to take advantage of a moment in time, going to be partners with our vendors and make sure that we're good to them as they -- we expect them to be good to us. So the rate of those firm orders has come down. We are now sort of beyond that, and I do expect use of working capital, particularly inventory to come down a little bit. But it will continue to grow a little bit as we -- as the business grows, as Eric pointed out. So I wasn't as pleased this quarter with the working capital use. We expected it. And again, the rate of change in that inventory spend is down considerably compared to the first half of the year.\nEric Mendelson: And also, David, just to add one other little anecdote. Of course, the purchase of the 737NG and 777 display unit business was the purchase of a product line. And as a result, a good chunk of the inventory increase was due to that. So that really is an acquisition. It's a new business. It's all good inventory. But that obviously shows up as inventory. So you have to sort of take that into account. So when that stripped out, the increase is much smaller.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks for the detailed answer. The other question I had on FSG margins, I know you talked about the year-over-year improvement. But margins did drop. GAAP margins did drop a little bit sequentially. What drove that 50 basis point drop sequentially? Was that mix or something else?\nCarlos Macau: There is -- I think, David the -- what we've told folks, there is nothing unusual about what's happening in the margin sequentially. I think what we've told folks is that we expect the segment to run between 22%, maybe as high as 23% as it has been in the last quarter. I don't think there is anything usual going on. It's ebbs and flows. You have a little shift in mix. As Eric pointed out, some of the commercial business was down in Specialty Products. The parts business is doing very well. That is margin helpful. The repair business is growing also. That is a little bit less accretive than the parts business. So you are going to have puts and takes as we get the business to sort of settle into the vertical footprints of the segment. So I wouldn't look \u2013 there is no one-times or odd things going on in there.\nEric Mendelson: But David, this is Eric. Also the way that I look at it from an operating perspective is, a year ago, our EBITA margin, or what we call the Flight Support Group cash margin, in the third quarter was 23.4%. This year despite the acquisition of Wencor which was at a sort of a lower cash margin, we've been able to increase the cash margin up 180 basis points to 25.2%. So I think those numbers are really outstanding. And this, as Carlos says, they just bounce around. I mean we -- that's why we say, it is going to be within a certain range, but that's just standard noise.\nDavid Strauss: Got it. Okay, thanks very much.\nEric Mendelson : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPete Skibitski: Good morning guys. I guess to start with, Eric. Eric last quarter, you guys talked about the supply chain negatively impacting the repair business. And I think maybe it sounds like it did a bit this quarter as well just because it sounds like parts kind of drove the business. So can you talk through kind of do you see any light at the end of the tunnel there or maybe more specifically what's going on the supply chain?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would say, Pete we definitely have supply chain problems all over the business. It\u2019s -- our vendors are challenged. There's a huge demand out there and getting -- we really got to be on top of your supply chain. You got to be on top of your vendors to make sure that you're prioritized and that they do is what they expect. We still have a large backlog of past due. And frankly, that's driven by certain vendors or many vendors' inability to produce according to their commitments. So that continues to be a struggle. And frankly, I don't see a tremendous amount of improvement in the aviation supply chain. Basically, demand is just outstripping supply. A lot of people retired. Some businesses shut down, some businesses lost their, if you will, special processes. Despite everyone knowing that this is a high-tech industry, there are a lot of, I would say, less documented processes out there with suppliers. And when they didn't need to produce for a period of time, largely as a result of certain large OEMs ripping out all their orders very quickly, those folks retired and a lot of these special processes went away undocumented. And the industry has really struggled. And I think this is why, if you look at the air framers, the engine manufacturers, they have really, really struggled, as a result of their actions, and basically slashing the supply chain the way they did. This is why HEICO, we fought like hell to keep our people to lay-off as few as possible to figure out how people would go to reduce schedules, because we knew that when the industry came back, we wanted to make sure that our most valuable asset was going to come back. And I can tell you that there are companies out there who just went and cut 40%, 50% of their workforces, not on a temporary basis, but on a permanent basis. And as a result, when they go back and they try to hire these folks, they can't get them back because some of retired, some are pissed off, all sorts of reasons. So it's a long road back. And I think that's why the major manufacturers are having a big, big problem.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. So you would say just go forward, you expect the parts business to grow faster because, that business, you are less beholden to suppliers versus the repair business?\nEric Mendelson: I wouldn't \u2013 it is hard to say which will grow faster. We are pretty confident of our growth in both. There is no question that when you ship individual parts, you are less impacted by a particular suppliers inability to supply because you ship all the other parts that you have in stock. Whereas when you are overhauling a component or a line replaceable unit, LRU, you can only shift the component if you have all the parts. So if there is a bill of material of 200 parts and you are missing one, you're not shipping that unit. So that creates complications. And of course, when you're building a complex assembly like an airplane or an engine, then you have that problem in spades. But I think all of our businesses are performing quite well. It's just that there is plenty of past-due backlog and sales actually could be even higher if we had those parts in from our suppliers.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And if I could just ask one to Victor. Victor, you touched on it, but I was wondering if you could talk more about the medical and other area in ETG. And almost if we could bifurcate it because I know the medical portion had that COVID-type surge and now it is kind of normalizing. I imagine in the next quarter or two, that will kind of normalize. But is the broader economy negatively impacting the other portion of medical and other? Or are you not -- is that growing more strongly than medical is?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. I think what happened in medical is we had very strong orders in actually '21, '22 at first and the things we make, it was -- some of it was stronger, but a lot of it was weaker. Because if you remember, they talked about the elective procedures and things like that -- that were deferred. And then there was a surge in 2021 and 2022 and even part of 2023. And then I think what happened was the manufacturers concluded they had too much on the shelves, and I think maybe some of the orders at the -- at our customers' level, right from the end-users, did not materialize or they were slower. They have had to work through those -- that inventory. And we are now seeing more of the customers coming back to us saying, you know what, can you move things to the left, right? As opposed to moving them out to the right before as opposed to deferring them, can you pull these in? Can you ship sooner? We were going to defer this order, but now we're not going to, right? We were having discussions like those. I don't know if it is a sign of the broader economy as well mixed into it. It's a good question and I wish I had great visibility on that. But I do know at the very least, it seems like a classic case of over-order and higher expectations for, let's say, the actual health care delivery from the health care delivery system out of manufacturers.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. So it sounds like you think that the destocking is about over in the next quarter or so, it sounds like?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. That's how it feels to me. I would say we're -- I've seen some signs, some green shoots, so to speak, but it feels more kind of in this bottom or bottoming mode. But we are seeing much higher quote activity. And usually, not always but usually, that's an indication that gets followed up by orders not long after.\nPete Skibitski : Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.\nLouis Raffetto: Hi, good morning gentlemen.\nEric Mendelson: Good morning Louis.\nLouis Raffetto: Maybe I can just start with, I guess, couple of things I noticed. Impairment charge, not something we see from you guys. So just was curious if you had any sort of additional information about that. And is that at all related to the change in the contingency consideration as well? Just not sure if those kind of offset each other on the income statement or if one was in one spot and one was somewhere else.\nCarlos Macau: So this is Carlos. The impairment charge and the contingent contingency reversal were both within the ETG segment. They were for two different subsidiaries. One was related to a business we have that is in the space industry where some of the end-markets have changed, the revenue projections have come down. So this is a trade name impairment. It is just essentially math. The business is doing fine. It is just our expectation is a little higher on the business when we bought it as far as putting a value to a trade name. And so we came to the conclusion this quarter that we would impair that trade name a bit. The contingent earnout was due to change in circumstances at one of our subsidiaries whereby the likelihood that they would meet the earn-out objectives was low. And it was kind of a clip earnout, so it was an all or nothing thing. So that occurred this quarter when it became apparent to us that they weren't going to earn that earnout. So it is a coincidence. They happened at the same time, 2 different subs. They both went through selling -- they went to general administrative expenses, so they kind of offset each other. It was a bit of a non-event.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. Appreciate the color, Carlos. And then maybe just the Capewell deal. I know it is not hugely material, but anyway, just to size at least from a cash usage in the fourth quarter?\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I don't think -- I don't believe -- I don't think it's going to be a big cash usage. I mean we'll -- we borrowed for the majority of the acquisition. It should be a good deal for us. It's a good margin business. It, as Eric pointed out, it does nichey stuff in aviation parts and some military. And so more to come, we'll see. It's not a \u2013 it is an immaterial acquisition for HEICO in total, so we're not giving out too much of the financial details or anything like that. But it is not dilutive to the segment margins, if that is part of your question.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I can tell you, I'm really excited about this business, excited about the technology, the people, the capability. You look at what -- on the two businesses, I mean, one is the cockpit or aircraft egress. These are really critical, very cost-effective solutions. If you don't have these solutions and the airplane catches on fire in certain situations, it's going to be really bad. And these solutions are time-tested and work extremely well. So we are really happy for them to be in the HEICO portfolio. And if you look at the military threats that are facing this country and the world today, the aerial drop solutions are really, really critical. Super, super critical. And we are working on a number of programs with various militaries around the world. But if you've got to deliver material at hotspots where you don't control the ground, this is the only way to do it. And there is all sorts of unique technology going on now which is going to further drive this because now, of course we are able to have these autonomous vehicles, you are able to drop all sorts of autonomous vehicles. And there is going to be a huge demand for this. So we think that it's really a good space to be in. Great name. This company, I mean, Capewell was the pioneer in this space. Whether it is paratroopers, or they also have the ejection seat release mechanism. So if you eject from a fighter aircraft and you've got a release as you -- at a certain point, you're able to do that. And they're really very, very well accepted by the customers around the world. So I think it is going to fit extremely well in the HEICO portfolio.\nLouis Raffetto : Really, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Herbert: Hi, good morning Eric. Maybe, Eric, I just wanted to start with you in the FSG segment. As you think about -- since you acquired Wencor, you've basically sort of been 2x-ing your organic growth relative to sort of volume growth in the industry if I assume sort of high single-digit 10% ASK growth we've seen over the last several quarters. As you think about normalizing, now you have Wencor and the opportunities from price, share gain, secular trend in terms of PMA growth, is sort of 2x volume growth the right way to continue to think about how you view your aftermarket opportunity within the segment sort of beyond fiscal '24?\nEric Mendelson: Well, we certainly hope so. I don't know whether 2 times is the correct number. We'll, I guess, find out after the fact. But there is no question that we had significant growth in excess of the market, whether you look at ASMs or whatever other factor, we are really growing well. And yes, that is a result of capturing market share. And there, frankly is still a lot out there. So we're working really, really hard to make that happen. Frankly, if you had asked me this many years ago, whether we'd be at this number, I wouldn't have thought so. But our people continue to surprise us, as a result of their hard work. So we hope so, but I guess time will tell.\n Q - Kenneth Herbert: Okay. And as I think about the share opportunity, are you seeing it more from new customers that airlines that maybe you haven't worked with before? Or is it sort of a greater capture of the wallet at additional customers, and any sort of differentiation you can provide along those lines?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I mean we pretty much deal -- we sell to, I would think, every single airline in the world, certainly every major airline in the world. So it really is a story of additional capture at those airlines. That's really the big -- that is the big key for us.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. And just finally can you quantify the Honeywell sort of the product line impact in the second quarter growth, or I'm sorry, the third quarter growth?\nEric Mendelson: I don't -- Carlos, I don't know if we're providing --.\nCarlos Macau: So Ken, what I could tell you is that roughly $217 million, just a tick under $217 million of sales in the quarter were inorganic, were acquired. And so most of that was Wencor and a little bit of the legacy display business.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. Perfect.\nEric Mendelson: I should add, Ken, that again just as I mentioned about Capewell in the prior call -- prior question, we are very excited about the legacy business. And we think that this has got tremendous potential, gets us into a unique technology. And we are really very, very excited about it and happy to entrench ourselves even deeper with our customers. So I think that that was an outstanding product line acquisition, and frankly, something that's extremely transformative for HEICO because it really puts us into the guts, a key part of the airplane. I mean when you go -- next time you go in a cockpit on a 737 or NG, just take a quick look in there and you'll see our six big screens. And that is really very high visibility of course, for the pilots, but too within the airline. And we have very, very good customer response thus far. They are very happy that HEICO has entered this business, and we'll give them the turn time and the quality that they expect. So I am very bullish on that.\nKenneth Herbert : Thanks Eric, I\u2019ll pass it back there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks so much. All of them good morning. A few questions, if that's okay. I'll start out with Victor and then go to Eric for the last one. Victor, maybe can you talk about, just to double check, the trade name impairment, that $6 million is offset by the contingent liability this quarter, so they net out. And if you could give us an idea of cash margins, 27% cash margins this quarter versus 28% last year, kind of what happened there? And how do we think about pre-Exxelia cash margin?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. I'm going to let Carlos answer on the impairment and the cash margins. And I will just comment that the Exxelia business, as a rule-of-thumb penalizes us by about 200 basis points of margin and somewhere in that zone. But I'll let Carlos, if, Carlos you don't mind taking that.\nCarlos Macau: Sure, sure. Good morning Sheila, so as I mentioned earlier, the impairment, in the world of accounting, you have to assess all these intangible assets all the time. And when you establish purchase accounting on day one for an acquisition, you make estimates on what you think the revenues are going to do. And when you have a trade name, it is a static intangible asset, it doesn't amortize. You have to look at it under impairment model. In this particular case, there was a change in some of the end-markets that affect one of our subs and we thought it was prudent to impair some of that trade name this quarter. And that's really what it was. Nothing spectacular. We do the analysis every quarter. We look at it annually. And it just so happened this quarter we decided that to impair that trade name made a lot of sense. Candidly, it makes my life easier because any time you can get stuff off the books like that, it is less things to housekeep on a quarterly basis. So that's why we did it.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. So they net out each other?\nCarlos Macau: They do, yes. The contingent earn-out change and the impairment. One was -- the earnout change is about $5.5 million in ETG, positive, and the negative was a $6 million earn-out. So it's roughly about a $500,000 drag, not significant at all to the operating margin.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks, Carlos. And good morning. I wanted to just ask about cash margins year-over-year. I think they were down 100 bps. Is that right? In ETG?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, down just a tick. And I think that is just because of the volume drop. If you listened to what we said earlier, the end-markets, the other electronic products, so non-defense, non-space, non-aerospace those other lines of business we serve is roughly 30%, give or take of the segment. That business is down, as Victor talked about earlier. What's, I think, contributing some of the drag on the margin is the SG&A spend that we have has not really materially changed. Again, as Eric talked earlier, we don't really have knee-jerk reactions at HEICO if one of our businesses is having a challenge in any particular quarter or year, unless it is something that we believe will last a lifetime, we don't ask them to right-size their business. We actually want to retain that talent and keep that overhead spend, so that when the business turns, we are there to support our customers. I believe that that contributed. We talk about that as SG&A inefficiencies or lack of efficiencies in SG&A, that's really, I think what the volume aspect and the impact of that has had on the segment. And that -- once those sales come back, which we expect they will turn, I think the order volume and the backlog supports that judgment, that will go away and you should see some expansion in the margins.\nEric Mendelson: Sheila, this is Eric. Although this isn't my area, but looking at the numbers, it looks like to me actually that the cash margin at ETG went up roughly 70 basis points from last year. So it is improved. Yes.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Sorry, I must have had the wrong number.\nEric Mendelson: Yes.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I'm going to get to you, Eric, I promise. But Victor, maybe just -- I know you've been at this for 12 quarters straight. Why do you think the defense markets are dragging when even underperforming peers are starting to see double-digit defense growth?\nVictor Mendelson: We had double-digit defense growth this year, so I don't think we're underperforming. I think we have excellent defense growth this year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Got it. So that 30%, that's the drag. And then last question, Eric...\nVictor Mendelson: The drag is from the other markets for sure.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Eric, you laid out seven sort of opportunities, and whether it is revenue or cost synergies that have happened with Wencor, maybe if you could talk about -- you made a comment about commercials and sales operation and Wencor lifts all PMAs now. So how do you think about where the PMA focus is when we think about HEICO and Wencor, as a combined entity going to an airline, how does it allow you to upsell?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So what we do, we still go as individual businesses to the airlines which is really typical of the HEICO model. Because even though we have, for example even pre-Wencor, within the HEICO parts group or the HEICO repair group, there are many subsidiaries. So for example, in the HEICO parts group, there are 6 PMA companies. And within the HEICO repair group, there are 11 repair companies. And those companies already went individually to the airlines to make sure they were supporting their product and to find additional opportunities. So we still -- there may be an overall, if you will HEICO parts group contract and contact and as well as a HEICO repair group contact and contract. However, we always sent the individual businesses in because they're the ones who are most knowledgeable about their product lines. So you want to go sit down with an engineer or somebody in the shop, there's nobody better than somebody who's really into the details and understand everything there is to know about that particular product: the materials, the metallurgy, the dimensions, the manufacturing process, how it's inspected, how it is installed, how other people are using it. And that's always been the strength of HEICO. And fortunately, Wencor has done exactly the same thing. I think, frankly, they saw the HEICO model -- this is pre-acquisition. They saw the HEICO model, and they thought that it worked quite well, and imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and they adopted it. So there's no change. So Wencor goes in the same way, really understands their product, and they make sure on a parts and repair basis that they're in there at the detail level. Now having said that, we do get executives and other senior leadership from the airline saying, hey, look, you guys got 19,000 PMAs and you've got thousands of, whatever the number is, 7,000 DERs, and I want to understand what we can do as a bigger package. And so when they want to do that, then we are able to aggregate it and show them the greater overall package and what they can achieve. And we've been very successful in presenting that. But again, when it comes in to tactically dealing with the airline, we make sure that each individual business is well tied in to do that.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Thanks for taking the question and thanks for sticking around here. Maybe, Eric, just back to Ken's line of questioning, and even what you've been talking about. You are outgrowing the market, you're getting the synergies and cross and upsell opportunities from Wencor. I guess the sequential revenue growth, two part question here, in FSG, sequential growth has ticked higher every quarter, you are over 5%. How do we think about FSG growth if and when Boeing and Airbus can start getting these planes out the door? Would you expect to see some pressure on your volumes? And I mean, you talked about airlines and you're picking up share, but I'm just I'm just curious if that's because they're just operating older equipment longer. And once we start to see some of the global fleet go under higher levels of warranty, is that going to create a natural headwind for you guys?\nEric Mendelson: I certainly hope not. I mean I understand logically what you are saying. But I think that's also counterbalanced by the fact that a lot of aircraft have been delivered in the last 10 years. And those aircraft are significantly more expensive to maintain than the old ones. And they are all getting ordered by one year every year. So yes, to the extent there is greater retirement that would reduce sales. However, that is being mitigated by this huge group of aircraft that have been recently delivered, and the newer generations and the fleet sizes are significantly larger than the older ones. So I think that's going to mitigate it. And you look at also the additional products that we offer now in particular with the Wencor acquisition and the display units and all that stuff, we have significantly higher content on these newer aircraft. So I think that's going to mitigate it. And then also anecdotally, I can tell you that there are a number of airlines who are in fact, operating, as you suggested, older aircraft. But I can tell you, and don't exactly quote me on this because if I'm getting it slightly mixed up, I don't want -- but directionally, you'll understand what I'm saying. For example, on the A320, I think there is not a fifth heavy maintenance check. So they're continuing -- a number of airlines are continuing to operate this aircraft to the end of the fifth maintenance check where they had been planning on doing it. That is not creating any revenue for us. So I think that there is a certain amount of older aircraft that continue to fly which aren't generating maintenance dollars. And that stuff is going to be pulled out. So I think you look at all this together -- and I'm very bullish. I mean we are not -- the team members at HEICO, the leadership, my family, we are not invested in HEICO for any one cycle. We're invested because we think that this is a very, very excellent space to be with both commercial travel, business and leisure, as well as defense for decades. And there will inevitably be little bumps here and there. But the truth is not even the experts in the industry know where this is going to come out. And historically, we've always sailed right through those periods. So I can tell you from an operating perspective, that doesn't change our direction of travel or our focus on developing new products or making sure we have inventory on the shelf. Because whenever we've been tried -- whenever, historically, we've tried to be if you will, too cute and too smart, you miss it. And we -- HEICO's strength is because we had the parts on the shelf when no one else did.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one last quick one, shifting gears back to Capewell and specifically the aerial descent. Is that company and their product lines, are they a competitor with TransDigm's airborne systems? Or are they complementary? Or just how to think about their positioning in the marketplace?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think they are complementary. I think they are complementary. I think that a lot of the release mechanisms are sold to TransDigm, and they're very complementary in the market.\nMichael Ciarmoli: I\u2019ll jump here guys. Thanks for us all, take my question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hi, good morning guys. I had a quick question, first for Eric. Just in terms of the aftermarket replacement parts. Did you notice any discernible differences between types of products in terms of relative growth rate, like maybe engine versus airframe or stuff sell through the distribution channel versus direct? I don't know if there is any way to parse it, but -- or is it all kind of the same?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would say it's all the same. I'm not aware of any major trends in one particular area versus the other. I mean there are always puts and takes in the quarter based on a million factors, frankly, we don't even understand. But no, I\u2019d say that the strength was very, very broad based.\nGautam Khanna: It was. Okay. And in terms of the Wencor integration, and I know you generally don't integrate things fully. But here, you do have some common product development opportunity and the like I was just wondering like where are we with respect to level of integration relative to where you expect to be kind of a year or two years from now? Are we 50% of the way there? Are we -- I'm just curious from a -- what have you.\nEric Mendelson: No. I think we've done a great job, but I think that there is more. And I think -- I don't want to tip our competitors off as to additional stuff that we can do, but I think that there is still plenty of gas in the tank there. And as I've said before, Wencor is going to be -- the combination of HEICO and Wencor is going to be the gift that keeps on giving. And I think that there is a lot of additional areas where the businesses can benefit from one another, the customers can benefit. Frankly, we've got promotion opportunities within the company. There is a lot of, as we continue to acquire businesses, we need more -- we need additional team members to step up and take more responsibility. And I think that when we look at the HEICO and the Wencor team members, really, the sky is the limit for them. For folks who want to work hard and want to take on more responsibility, we have a lot of, whether it's acquisitions or whether it's organic growth, I mean, my gosh, 17% organic growth in the quarter, I mean, that's like a breakneck pace. And that's creating all sorts of promotional opportunities for people. The acquisitions they're creating, promotional opportunities for people. There's additional stuff that we can do on, in particular, on the repair side, sharing even more repairs, frankly, across our businesses. There is a lot of stuff that can be done. But when you're growing at 17%, it's hard just to keep up before you do all that stuff. So where are we? I would say we are definitely, for sure, in the first half. Where are we? We may even be at the first quarter. I think there is a lot more. But it's going to happen over time. It's not going to be something right away, and it is going to work out very well to people's personal career opportunities as they take on more, because I can tell you we've got so many acquisitions in the hopper and one of the greatest constraints that we have is not having enough internal people who we can promote to take on more responsibility at acquisitions. And sometimes we have to pass on acquisitions because we don't have those internal people. So I think there is going to be a very big opportunity.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you, Eric. And Victor, just one for you. In the past, you've called out space at times has been something that lagged. How is that business trending within ETG?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. I think overall, Carlos, correct me if I have it wrong, but this year or this quarter, it's roughly flattish for us. It's an important business. Carlos, do I have that right?\nCarlos Macau: I'm sorry, was that the organic growth?\nGautam Khanna: Organic in the space.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, it is flattish for the quarter. I mean, it's up, but it's for the year, it is flattish. It is up a little bit for the quarter.\nGautam Khanna: Perfect. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds.\nTony Bancroft: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a great quarter, and I thought a great job with the Capewell acquisition. I'm grateful to be a five-jump using Capewell's products and not getting dragged across the Alabama fields at Airborne school. But regarding the displays acquisition from Honeywell, obviously that looks like a great business as well. A lot of opportunity for integration there into those platforms. Are there any other programs on the display side like that out there? I know there is obviously other OEs that do it, obviously, and then smaller companies like ISSC. Just want to get your thoughts on that market.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We think -- Tony, this is Eric. We think the display unit is a really good market to be in. We already do some displays. I can tell you that these displays in particular would be extremely difficult, if not impossible to do unless it was the way that we did it, through the purchase of the Honeywell IP, to be able to overhaul these. So I think that -- that's very important. And we can take their IP and their product and then we are able to combine that with the HEICO high-quality and turn-time that our customers have come to expect, and deliver a terrific product. So I'm very, very excited about this. It really fits extremely nicely within our avionics package at HEICO.\nTony Bancroft: Thank you. Great job.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you. And we're glad that you're safe with our Capewell releases.\nTony Bancroft: Yes. Great product. Good, safe product. I like it.\nOperator: And at this time, I will turn the conference back to Laurans Mendelson for any additional or closing remarks.\nEric Mendelson: I think we are having a technical challenge. This is Eric. So I would like to thank everybody for participating on our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you at our -- on our fourth quarter call towards the end of December. If anybody has any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Carlos, to Victor or me or our dad, and we're happy to speak with you and answer whatever additional questions you have. We thank you very much for your interest in HEICO. We hope you appreciate the great results that we've put forth today and look forward to a terrific fourth quarter. So stay well and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you very much. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you, and thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So the answer to your question is, as we continue to grow the volume of the business, we do expect to eke out incremental margin gains consistent with our history. As the base of the business grows, the amount of overhead needed to support it is relative to that growth, it's a little lower. So I expect we'll get that. If you look back, I've quoted this before, if you look back a decade, and look at the margin gains, that's kind of what I would expect going forward once we sell into our footprint here in the FSG and ETG. And I do think you're talking about an EBITA margin, so it's pretty elevated, we were happy with it this quarter. And I think that as we move forward, that should continue to stabilize and eke out improvements. Hi, Peter, this is Carlos. I just want to point out, you are not wrong on what you said about 50% of the segment. But right now, we're tracking around 40%. So we still have -- I've mentioned in the past, once the mix sort of settles down, I do expect our defense to become closer to the 50% number over time. Right now, we are still a little behind on the total revenues in the segment being only around 40% for defense this quarter. Well, I think, look -- we -- by nature, we're an acquisitive company, and we set out an aggressive timetable to pay down some of the debt that we had, and we've done that. I think the opportunities are abound. As long as we can keep our leverage candidly under three, there is opportunities for us. And I think that the goal for us is to find very profitable companies that don't disrupt that leverage, the ones that have real high EBITDA, which has been our history, right? I mean we like high margin businesses. So the more acquisitions we do with the higher margin, the less impact it has on our leverage. And that's where I'm steering things when we talk internally about these deals. I don't know how much more I could add to that. I would say that the rate of increase in inventory spend has come down relative to the growth in the business. I mean, our sales are, for the quarter, up 37% comparatively and our use -- our inventory spend is not ramping at that pace. So I'm happy with that. I think what I mentioned earlier in the year, David, was that we had a fair amount of orders outstanding on firm commitment inventory that some of our subsidiaries had made two years ago just because of lead times. And so we made good on those. We are not the type of company that disrupts our vendor base or does bad things to our vendor base to take advantage of a moment in time, going to be partners with our vendors and make sure that we're good to them as they -- we expect them to be good to us. So the rate of those firm orders has come down. We are now sort of beyond that, and I do expect use of working capital, particularly inventory to come down a little bit. But it will continue to grow a little bit as we -- as the business grows, as Eric pointed out. So I wasn't as pleased this quarter with the working capital use. We expected it. And again, the rate of change in that inventory spend is down considerably compared to the first half of the year. There is -- I think, David the -- what we've told folks, there is nothing unusual about what's happening in the margin sequentially. I think what we've told folks is that we expect the segment to run between 22%, maybe as high as 23% as it has been in the last quarter. I don't think there is anything usual going on. It's ebbs and flows. You have a little shift in mix. As Eric pointed out, some of the commercial business was down in Specialty Products. The parts business is doing very well. That is margin helpful. The repair business is growing also. That is a little bit less accretive than the parts business. So you are going to have puts and takes as we get the business to sort of settle into the vertical footprints of the segment. So I wouldn't look \u2013 there is no one-times or odd things going on in there. So this is Carlos. The impairment charge and the contingent contingency reversal were both within the ETG segment. They were for two different subsidiaries. One was related to a business we have that is in the space industry where some of the end-markets have changed, the revenue projections have come down. So this is a trade name impairment. It is just essentially math. The business is doing fine. It is just our expectation is a little higher on the business when we bought it as far as putting a value to a trade name. And so we came to the conclusion this quarter that we would impair that trade name a bit. The contingent earnout was due to change in circumstances at one of our subsidiaries whereby the likelihood that they would meet the earn-out objectives was low. And it was kind of a clip earnout, so it was an all or nothing thing. So that occurred this quarter when it became apparent to us that they weren't going to earn that earnout. So it is a coincidence. They happened at the same time, 2 different subs. They both went through selling -- they went to general administrative expenses, so they kind of offset each other. It was a bit of a non-event. Yes. I don't think -- I don't believe -- I don't think it's going to be a big cash usage. I mean we'll -- we borrowed for the majority of the acquisition. It should be a good deal for us. It's a good margin business. It, as Eric pointed out, it does nichey stuff in aviation parts and some military. And so more to come, we'll see. It's not a \u2013 it is an immaterial acquisition for HEICO in total, so we're not giving out too much of the financial details or anything like that. But it is not dilutive to the segment margins, if that is part of your question. So Ken, what I could tell you is that roughly $217 million, just a tick under $217 million of sales in the quarter were inorganic, were acquired. And so most of that was Wencor and a little bit of the legacy display business. Sure, sure. Good morning Sheila, so as I mentioned earlier, the impairment, in the world of accounting, you have to assess all these intangible assets all the time. And when you establish purchase accounting on day one for an acquisition, you make estimates on what you think the revenues are going to do. And when you have a trade name, it is a static intangible asset, it doesn't amortize. You have to look at it under impairment model. In this particular case, there was a change in some of the end-markets that affect one of our subs and we thought it was prudent to impair some of that trade name this quarter. And that's really what it was. Nothing spectacular. We do the analysis every quarter. We look at it annually. And it just so happened this quarter we decided that to impair that trade name made a lot of sense. Candidly, it makes my life easier because any time you can get stuff off the books like that, it is less things to housekeep on a quarterly basis. So that's why we did it. They do, yes. The contingent earn-out change and the impairment. One was -- the earnout change is about $5.5 million in ETG, positive, and the negative was a $6 million earn-out. So it's roughly about a $500,000 drag, not significant at all to the operating margin. Yes, down just a tick. And I think that is just because of the volume drop. If you listened to what we said earlier, the end-markets, the other electronic products, so non-defense, non-space, non-aerospace those other lines of business we serve is roughly 30%, give or take of the segment. That business is down, as Victor talked about earlier. What's, I think, contributing some of the drag on the margin is the SG&A spend that we have has not really materially changed. Again, as Eric talked earlier, we don't really have knee-jerk reactions at HEICO if one of our businesses is having a challenge in any particular quarter or year, unless it is something that we believe will last a lifetime, we don't ask them to right-size their business. We actually want to retain that talent and keep that overhead spend, so that when the business turns, we are there to support our customers. I believe that that contributed. We talk about that as SG&A inefficiencies or lack of efficiencies in SG&A, that's really, I think what the volume aspect and the impact of that has had on the segment. And that -- once those sales come back, which we expect they will turn, I think the order volume and the backlog supports that judgment, that will go away and you should see some expansion in the margins. I'm sorry, was that the organic growth? Yes, it is flattish for the quarter. I mean, it's up, but it's for the year, it is flattish. It is up a little bit for the quarter."

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales were $322.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to $325.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The slight net sales decrease principally reflects lower other electronics and medical products net sales, partially offset by increased defense, space and aerospace products net sales. This is in line with our expectations as we've commented on our earnings conference calls over the last few quarters and is consistent with inventory destocking at some customers. We continue to anticipate quarterly volatility in the ETG's defense net sales, but the overall trend remains very positive. As expected, other electronic net sales were lower during the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the third quarter of fiscal '23. We believe these order trends in these markets have bottomed, and we are seeing improved orders in some of our companies in these other markets. These other markets typically equate to between 25% and 30% of our sales. We continue to expect an overall return to growth in these end-markets and businesses during the first half of fiscal '25. The ETG's record backlog and strong overall orders support our optimism, and as the non-A&D markets improve, we expect a healthy tailwind into our next fiscal year. Orders for commercial aviation and defense products have been very robust, and we are very pleased with our business' performance, like at Exxelia, which continues to be a strong acquisition, meeting our performance expectations including growing its profit margins. Further, our order book and quotation activity for fiscal 2026 is building nicely. And I did mean to say fiscal '26, in addition to '25, of course which augments our optimism for later periods as well. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved 23.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from 22.8% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. I'd also note that before acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses, our operating margin was above 27% as those intangibles amortization expenses consume around 400 basis points of our margin. And that's how we judge our businesses as that most closely correlates to our cash. So when we look at how our businesses are doing on an operating basis, we are very pleased with the overall margins and their continued improvement. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, partially offset by lower level of SG&A efficiencies. I turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Yes. Thank you, Bert. They are good questions. I don't think where we are and so far in the back half of the year has really been a surprise to us. I think we tried to hint in the second quarter call that we thought, for example margins were higher in that period that we would look for an average over the course of the year. So it is not really too far out of line, maybe slightly. We are doing the budgets for fiscal '25. But when I look at our backlogs and I look at our order rate, it feels to me as though we would have a stronger growth rate in fiscal 2025. Again, it's a little premature for me to say that with certainty because our companies do their budgets now and submit them in early October. So I'm waiting on those. But right now, that's how it feels to me, yes. Yes. So Peter, the defense part of the business and commercial aviation really have been extremely strong, experiencing double-digit growth. And again that is where some of our longer-term bookings really come on the defense side. And seeing some of those fill out beyond '25, as well as some of the quote activity in the order indications, again, to 2025 and beyond. So right now, I feel like defense is a good leader for us. And commercial aviation has really been phenomenal. So when I take that together, I look at the other markets, which are down consistent with, I think, what other people are seeing in these kinds of markets, and it looks like those order rates are bottoming out. It appears to us that our customers have kind of used up the excess inventory and the orders are coming in, and if you add a sort of six month lead time on that -- it gets us into fiscal '25. And that's why I say I feel like there will be a very nice tailwind from that next year. Of course, I can't be certain on that, but that's just how it feels right now. Yes. I think what happened in medical is we had very strong orders in actually '21, '22 at first and the things we make, it was -- some of it was stronger, but a lot of it was weaker. Because if you remember, they talked about the elective procedures and things like that -- that were deferred. And then there was a surge in 2021 and 2022 and even part of 2023. And then I think what happened was the manufacturers concluded they had too much on the shelves, and I think maybe some of the orders at the -- at our customers' level, right from the end-users, did not materialize or they were slower. They have had to work through those -- that inventory. And we are now seeing more of the customers coming back to us saying, you know what, can you move things to the left, right? As opposed to moving them out to the right before as opposed to deferring them, can you pull these in? Can you ship sooner? We were going to defer this order, but now we're not going to, right? We were having discussions like those. I don't know if it is a sign of the broader economy as well mixed into it. It's a good question and I wish I had great visibility on that. But I do know at the very least, it seems like a classic case of over-order and higher expectations for, let's say, the actual health care delivery from the health care delivery system out of manufacturers. Yes. That's how it feels to me. I would say we're -- I've seen some signs, some green shoots, so to speak, but it feels more kind of in this bottom or bottoming mode. But we are seeing much higher quote activity. And usually, not always but usually, that's an indication that gets followed up by orders not long after. Sure. I'm going to let Carlos answer on the impairment and the cash margins. And I will just comment that the Exxelia business, as a rule-of-thumb penalizes us by about 200 basis points of margin and somewhere in that zone. But I'll let Carlos, if, Carlos you don't mind taking that. We had double-digit defense growth this year, so I don't think we're underperforming. I think we have excellent defense growth this year. The drag is from the other markets for sure. Yes. I think overall, Carlos, correct me if I have it wrong, but this year or this quarter, it's roughly flattish for us. It's an important business. Carlos, do I have that right?"

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Samara, thank you very much and good morning to everyone on this call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO third quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I am joined this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Now before reviewing our operating results, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for their contribution to our record-setting performance. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operational excellence translated into excellent results for our shareholders. And I continue to be very optimistic about the future of HEICO. Over the past 16 quarters we've experienced incredible growth in our commercial aviation markets after emerging from one of the darkest times in aerospace history when air travel slowed to a crawl amid COVID-19 pandemic. I couldn't be prouder of the professionalism and tenacity of our team members, who demonstrated serving our customers during this period of rapid growth. Their ability to meet the challenge of accelerated growth is commendable, and this includes the remarkable Wencor team members who joined HEICO family last year. In addition, I am pleased with the progress and effort of our team members have made serving customers in the defense industry. It is my expectation that growth in this global industry will continue despite who wins the upcoming elections, and the softer results we realized over the past few years appear to be in the rearview mirror. And now I'd like to summarize the highlights of our third quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO and improved by 45% and 37%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter fiscal '23. I think you' all agree that those are outstanding results. Consolidated net income increased 34% to a record $136.6 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '24. And that was up from $102 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the third quarter of fiscal '24, improving 68% and 72%, respectively, over the third quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect strong 15% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand for the Flight Support Group's commercial aerospace products and services and the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated EBITDA increased 45% to $261.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $179.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.11x as of July 31, '24. That was down from 3.04 times as of October 31, '23. Our excellent operating results have allowed us to early-achieve the forecast we made a year ago that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would return to historical level of about 2 times within roughly one year to 18 months following the Wencor acquisition. And that's excluding any impact of further acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is extremely robust with opportunities in both Flight Support and ETG, and we intend to follow our time-tested strategy of opportunistic acquisitions that continue to expand the cash generating ability of HEICO. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 47% to $214 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $145.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. In July '24, we increased our regular semi-annual cash dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share. This represented our 92nd consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. I'd like to now discuss our recent acquisition activity. You may recall, in December '23, we announced the acquisition of exclusive perpetual licenses and certain assets from Honeywell International to support the Boeing 737NG and the 777 cockpit display and legacy displays product lines which that group has been performing extremely well for us. As a result, in May '24, we completed a second transaction with Honeywell International, under which we acquired additional licenses and certain assets to further enhance the manufacturing of these new products, including screens or military variant of the Boeing 737NG and 777 cockpit displays and legacy displays product lines. Last week, we announced that Flight Support Group acquired the aerial delivery and descent divisions of Capewell Aerial Systems. Purchase price of this acquisition was paid in cash, principally using proceeds from our revolving credit facility. And we expect this acquisition to be accretive to our earnings within the first-year following the acquisition. At this time, I'd like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the third quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric? Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we remain optimistic about achieving net sales growth for both FSG and ETG. This growth is expected to be largely fueled by the contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions, along with sustained demand for the majority of our products. Additionally, we are committed to ongoing product and service innovation, further market penetration, and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In conclusion, I want to again express my gratitude to the exceptional team members for their unwavering support and dedication to HEICO. Our strategy of building a diversified portfolio of outstanding businesses continues to deliver positive outcomes for our shareholders. Our key markets are very strong, and in fiscal '24, is shaping up to be another successful year. Thank you as shareholders for your continued trust. And as I mentioned before, I remain very optimistic about the future for HEICO. And now we'll open the floor to questions. Rob, I know -- this is Larry. I know you asked me the question, but Eric pre-empted me. So what he told you is accurate. The pipeline is very full. And we are looking at actually too many acquisitions right now. It's taking full time of the staff and it's -- we're looking more for nonprivate equity deals. That's more in our best interest, although we do see some private equity. The problem is they are priced very high. And when we try to compete, normally, we can't compete because of the pricing. But we have enough non-private equity deals really to fill all that we need. So for us, it's a buyer's market right now."

            "name": "Eric Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 68% to a record $681.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from $405 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal 2023 and 2024 acquisitions, and strong 15% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects increased demand across all of our product lines. As we continue to experience excellent organic growth within the FSG, we've also been highly successful in supplementing growth through acquisitions. Last week, we acquired Capewell, a Connecticut-based leading provider of proprietary aircraft cockpit, emergency egress and aerial delivery products for both the commercial aerospace and defense markets. I am very impressed with their manufacturing process and strict adherence to high reliability and quality products, which help ensure pilot troop safety worldwide. They also have an excellent staff of people who will fit extremely well within the HEICO family. The Wencor operations continued to exceed our expectations, and we are convinced this was an excellent investment for HEICO. Wencor's entrepreneurial culture and a record of producing high quality products continues to produce wins in the marketplace. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs. We continue to operate Wencor as a stand-alone business operation. However, we have made very good progress in working together and serving our customers in a combined seamless fashion. Some examples of how we are now working together include: one, utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all of our repair stations. Two, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation. Three, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO noncompetitive PMAs. Four, Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base, in particular, our specialty products and Electronic Technologies Group, to quote new products. Five, engineering and regulatory cooperation. Six, sharing best-in-class vendors. And seven, driving various back-office synergies, such as payroll and export compliance, that will help offset the cost of additional regulatory compliance, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and HEICO's FAA ODA program. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 72% to a record $153.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 up from $89.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in intangible asset amortization expense. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects higher net sales within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating margin increased to 22.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '24, up from 22.0% in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition related intangible amortization expense consumed approximately 270 basis points of our operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal '24, the FSG's cash margin before amortization, or EBITA was approximately 25.2%, which is excellent in absolute terms and is 180 basis points higher than the comparable Flight Support Group cash margin of 23.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. I am extremely pleased with these results. The increased operating margin principally reflects the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin, as well as lower acquisition costs, partially offset by the previously mentioned higher intangible asset amortization expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the third quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Victor? Thank you very much Rob, good morning to you. Yes. I think that's a great question, Rob, and I spent a lot of time in business reviews and with our sales folks, in particular, over the last month going over a lot of the details. There is no question that the market remains strong. But I do think the reason why the incredible 17% growth rate was so outstanding is because of really two factors. One, we continue to win in the marketplace. And HEICO is an accumulation or a combination of a lot of individual businesses working as hard as they can, planning years in advance, developing these products, having them on the shelf and being able to hit the demand and get them sold when the market needs them. So I think that's number one. Really, everybody's sort of, if you will, all the unsung heroes who are working their rear ends off every day to make this happen. So that's probably the first reason. The second would definitely be due to the addition of Wencor and the broadening of our product line. I think in speaking with our customers, we're viewed as a much more complete supplier. I mean, HEICO today has transitioned tremendously over the last many decades. And I think our customers are very confident in purchasing additional products from us, whether it is parts, distribution, PMA, repair. And I think we are growing our market share. So it's really, I think, yes, a strong market, but more I think really focusing on the detail by our businesses and the broadening of the product-line through Wencor and the 737 and 777 display unit acquisitions. No, we really don't, actually. And as a matter of fact, the number of airlines have sort of trimmed back their purchases. They, if you will, in hindsight, I think over-ordered a bit in 2023, took more than they needed in 2023. So we do have anecdotal evidence of certain customers cutting back this year. But that was really offset by strength at other customers. So I think we continue to do very well. And that really -- that gets to the sort of the beauty of the HEICO model in that we've got all these individual business units who have -- who control their own destiny. And if they are short in one area, they figure out how to make it up in another area, and this doesn't roll up to my desk after the fact and instead they are doing this real time. So in summary, no I mean, the market for us remains quite strong. Yes, we've definitely seen a reduction off of forecast due to their build rates. There is no question Airbus is doing, I think, better than Boeing in that area. But yes, definitely on the commercial OE production, things are softer than expected. That, of course has been offset by our strength in the defense side, and we expect that strength to continue into 2025, 2026 and after based on our conversations with our customers and what they want there. Rob, this is Eric. I'll take that just for a moment. Of course, a year ago, we were largely focused on Wencor is our largest deal in the history of the company, over $2 billion and that consumed a tremendous amount of capital as well as effort. So -- but I can tell you that our pipeline today remains incredibly robust. We have a lot of projects in the work. Our acquisitions teams are nonstop running around the country. I think we worked very hard to differentiate ourselves as the buyer of choice. And we'll keep our fingers crossed that some of these will come to fruition. But there is no question that in conversations, and I don't want to call out individual businesses because they have their own respective sellers and reasons for having dealt with us. But I can tell you that on all of our recent acquisitions I think HEICO's reputation has been key to getting all of those deals done and has made us a particularly attractive counterparty for our sellers and partners. And the pipeline remains very, very strong. Good morning Bert. Yes. Hi Bert. So the short answer, it's more of a volume story. I think last -- so this quarter, it was 17% for the parts business. And last quarter, I think it was 21%, as you mentioned. Most of that is volume. Some of it is price, but I would say it is definitely mostly on the volume side. We've been very firm about passing along our price increases to our customers. And we've got to make sure as our costs have gone up and whether that's labor or special processes, material, purchased product, whatever it is -- we've got to make sure that we get that passed along. So definitely, the vast majority of that is volume and then a much lesser extent would be the price. Yes. Again we haven't seen signs of any slowdown to-date. As a matter of fact, quite the contrary, sort of surprisingly to the contrary. And with regard to normally when there is a slowdown, obviously volumes drop, and that is when we pick up additional market share. That's when customers realize that they've got to take advantage of our additional cost savings, parts and repairs. And we pick up market share at that point. And then of course, when the economy recovers, we recover even stronger than most because we've picked up market share. The customers are very, I think very excited about the HEICO product line. They want to have competition, they are demanding competition, and HEICO provides very fair competition in that regard. So I think that we are going to do very well and, for sure pick up market share, get additional parts and repairs designed when that -- if that occurs. I would say it is very consistent with FSG. I mean we look at the various Wencor businesses, and their organic growth is very consistent. I mean some are -- there can be little anomalies here or there. But in general, they are doing very well and consistent with the legacy HEICO businesses. Yes, it has. And the overall offering has grown. And we've really seen the advantages of that, and frankly, the customer enthusiasm around it. It is a terrific business, and they basically have two main product lines. One is the commercial and military -- I'm sorry, the commercial and military aerial descent business. So basically, when you are -- the cockpit egress business, you need to have basically a way out of the cockpit in case the cockpit door is blocked, or also cargo aircraft or tankers need egress from the aircraft in the event of a problem. And they have a very sophisticated, well time-tested, appreciated product, which is in a number of commercial and military aircraft, which is really key and really the only way to get people out of the aircraft in the event they need to escape. And the standard slides are either inactive or don't exist on certain types of aircraft. So that's part of their business. And then the other part of their business is the area of descent piece, whether you're parachuting out of an airplane or if they're dropping tanks or various equipment, the C130s or C-17s or whatever it is, you've got fairly sophisticated parachutes that attach to it, and there are various attachment mechanisms and aerial drop mechanisms, which are really critical. So we think that this is a great business. It's really appreciated by its customers, and frankly, is the pioneer in this business and since the 1940s was the original company that designed the device, which permit paratroopers to jump out of airplanes and to detach once they hit the ground and not get dragged as a result of the parachute. And so that's a very strong business. It's a very nichey business, and that's why we thought it fit very well in our Specialty Products Group. And of course, our specialty products has a lot of connection to the overall -- to the other parts of Flight Support. So I think it's a very good fit. We're very excited about it. Hi, David, this is Eric. I'll start out with sort of the big picture and then Carlos will get into the specifics on the financial. HEICO has always been focused on customer service, making sure that we capture all of the incremental sales that we can capture. And if you look at coming out of COVID, HEICO recovered much quicker than most. And as a result of not cutting our people, not trimming our inventories too much, and bottom-line, we were able to support the market when others weren't. And that's really been a huge HEICO advantage. So I can tell you from an operational perspective, Victor and I are very, very focused on all of our business units, reviewing working capital, understanding specifically how the inventory or the receivables have increased. Obviously, receivables, that's up due to the huge increase in sales. But with regard to inventory, our businesses have been really outstanding in terms of having the correct inventory on the shelf. There are a lot of companies where their inventory blows up and they've got the wrong stuff on the shelf and they can't sell it, and then people find out after the fact that it's a problem. HEICO has always been very, very careful not to do that. And as a result, we have very, very robust inventory reserve policies to make sure that we are being very proactive and we make sure that we have the right inventory. So I think that there is no question that there is a big internal focus on inventory. We want to slow the growth. But it is really key to our business. And frankly, when you look at the 17% organic growth that we had in the aftermarket business, I mean that was really outstanding, and that can only be accomplished through increased inventories. But Carlos will get into the specifics for you. And also, David, just to add one other little anecdote. Of course, the purchase of the 737NG and 777 display unit business was the purchase of a product line. And as a result, a good chunk of the inventory increase was due to that. So that really is an acquisition. It's a new business. It's all good inventory. But that obviously shows up as inventory. So you have to sort of take that into account. So when that stripped out, the increase is much smaller. But David, this is Eric. Also the way that I look at it from an operating perspective is, a year ago, our EBITA margin, or what we call the Flight Support Group cash margin, in the third quarter was 23.4%. This year despite the acquisition of Wencor which was at a sort of a lower cash margin, we've been able to increase the cash margin up 180 basis points to 25.2%. So I think those numbers are really outstanding. And this, as Carlos says, they just bounce around. I mean we -- that's why we say, it is going to be within a certain range, but that's just standard noise. Thank you. Yes. I would say, Pete we definitely have supply chain problems all over the business. It's -- our vendors are challenged. There's a huge demand out there and getting -- we really got to be on top of your supply chain. You got to be on top of your vendors to make sure that you're prioritized and that they do is what they expect. We still have a large backlog of past due. And frankly, that's driven by certain vendors or many vendors' inability to produce according to their commitments. So that continues to be a struggle. And frankly, I don't see a tremendous amount of improvement in the aviation supply chain. Basically, demand is just outstripping supply. A lot of people retired. Some businesses shut down, some businesses lost their, if you will, special processes. Despite everyone knowing that this is a high-tech industry, there are a lot of, I would say, less documented processes out there with suppliers. And when they didn't need to produce for a period of time, largely as a result of certain large OEMs ripping out all their orders very quickly, those folks retired and a lot of these special processes went away undocumented. And the industry has really struggled. And I think this is why, if you look at the air framers, the engine manufacturers, they have really, really struggled, as a result of their actions, and basically slashing the supply chain the way they did. This is why HEICO, we fought like hell to keep our people to lay-off as few as possible to figure out how people would go to reduce schedules, because we knew that when the industry came back, we wanted to make sure that our most valuable asset was going to come back. And I can tell you that there are companies out there who just went and cut 40%, 50% of their workforces, not on a temporary basis, but on a permanent basis. And as a result, when they go back and they try to hire these folks, they can't get them back because some of retired, some are pissed off, all sorts of reasons. So it's a long road back. And I think that's why the major manufacturers are having a big, big problem. I wouldn't \u2013 it is hard to say which will grow faster. We are pretty confident of our growth in both. There is no question that when you ship individual parts, you are less impacted by a particular suppliers inability to supply because you ship all the other parts that you have in stock. Whereas when you are overhauling a component or a line replaceable unit, LRU, you can only shift the component if you have all the parts. So if there is a bill of material of 200 parts and you are missing one, you're not shipping that unit. So that creates complications. And of course, when you're building a complex assembly like an airplane or an engine, then you have that problem in spades. But I think all of our businesses are performing quite well. It's just that there is plenty of past-due backlog and sales actually could be even higher if we had those parts in from our suppliers. Good morning Louis. Yes. I can tell you, I'm really excited about this business, excited about the technology, the people, the capability. You look at what -- on the two businesses, I mean, one is the cockpit or aircraft egress. These are really critical, very cost-effective solutions. If you don't have these solutions and the airplane catches on fire in certain situations, it's going to be really bad. And these solutions are time-tested and work extremely well. So we are really happy for them to be in the HEICO portfolio. And if you look at the military threats that are facing this country and the world today, the aerial drop solutions are really, really critical. Super, super critical. And we are working on a number of programs with various militaries around the world. But if you've got to deliver material at hotspots where you don't control the ground, this is the only way to do it. And there is all sorts of unique technology going on now which is going to further drive this because now, of course we are able to have these autonomous vehicles, you are able to drop all sorts of autonomous vehicles. And there is going to be a huge demand for this. So we think that it's really a good space to be in. Great name. This company, I mean, Capewell was the pioneer in this space. Whether it is paratroopers, or they also have the ejection seat release mechanism. So if you eject from a fighter aircraft and you've got a release as you -- at a certain point, you're able to do that. And they're really very, very well accepted by the customers around the world. So I think it is going to fit extremely well in the HEICO portfolio. Well, we certainly hope so. I don't know whether 2 times is the correct number. We'll, I guess, find out after the fact. But there is no question that we had significant growth in excess of the market, whether you look at ASMs or whatever other factor, we are really growing well. And yes, that is a result of capturing market share. And there, frankly is still a lot out there. So we're working really, really hard to make that happen. Frankly, if you had asked me this many years ago, whether we'd be at this number, I wouldn't have thought so. But our people continue to surprise us, as a result of their hard work. So we hope so, but I guess time will tell.\n Q - Kenneth Herbert: Okay. And as I think about the share opportunity, are you seeing it more from new customers that airlines that maybe you haven't worked with before? Or is it sort of a greater capture of the wallet at additional customers, and any sort of differentiation you can provide along those lines? Yes. I mean we pretty much deal -- we sell to, I would think, every single airline in the world, certainly every major airline in the world. So it really is a story of additional capture at those airlines. That's really the big -- that is the big key for us. I don't -- Carlos, I don't know if we're providing --. I should add, Ken, that again just as I mentioned about Capewell in the prior call -- prior question, we are very excited about the legacy business. And we think that this has got tremendous potential, gets us into a unique technology. And we are really very, very excited about it and happy to entrench ourselves even deeper with our customers. So I think that that was an outstanding product line acquisition, and frankly, something that's extremely transformative for HEICO because it really puts us into the guts, a key part of the airplane. I mean when you go -- next time you go in a cockpit on a 737 or NG, just take a quick look in there and you'll see our six big screens. And that is really very high visibility of course, for the pilots, but too within the airline. And we have very, very good customer response thus far. They are very happy that HEICO has entered this business, and we'll give them the turn time and the quality that they expect. So I am very bullish on that. Sheila, this is Eric. Although this isn't my area, but looking at the numbers, it looks like to me actually that the cash margin at ETG went up roughly 70 basis points from last year. So it is improved. Yes. Yes. Yes. So what we do, we still go as individual businesses to the airlines which is really typical of the HEICO model. Because even though we have, for example even pre-Wencor, within the HEICO parts group or the HEICO repair group, there are many subsidiaries. So for example, in the HEICO parts group, there are 6 PMA companies. And within the HEICO repair group, there are 11 repair companies. And those companies already went individually to the airlines to make sure they were supporting their product and to find additional opportunities. So we still -- there may be an overall, if you will HEICO parts group contract and contact and as well as a HEICO repair group contact and contract. However, we always sent the individual businesses in because they're the ones who are most knowledgeable about their product lines. So you want to go sit down with an engineer or somebody in the shop, there's nobody better than somebody who's really into the details and understand everything there is to know about that particular product: the materials, the metallurgy, the dimensions, the manufacturing process, how it's inspected, how it is installed, how other people are using it. And that's always been the strength of HEICO. And fortunately, Wencor has done exactly the same thing. I think, frankly, they saw the HEICO model -- this is pre-acquisition. They saw the HEICO model, and they thought that it worked quite well, and imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and they adopted it. So there's no change. So Wencor goes in the same way, really understands their product, and they make sure on a parts and repair basis that they're in there at the detail level. Now having said that, we do get executives and other senior leadership from the airline saying, hey, look, you guys got 19,000 PMAs and you've got thousands of, whatever the number is, 7,000 DERs, and I want to understand what we can do as a bigger package. And so when they want to do that, then we are able to aggregate it and show them the greater overall package and what they can achieve. And we've been very successful in presenting that. But again, when it comes in to tactically dealing with the airline, we make sure that each individual business is well tied in to do that. I certainly hope not. I mean I understand logically what you are saying. But I think that's also counterbalanced by the fact that a lot of aircraft have been delivered in the last 10 years. And those aircraft are significantly more expensive to maintain than the old ones. And they are all getting ordered by one year every year. So yes, to the extent there is greater retirement that would reduce sales. However, that is being mitigated by this huge group of aircraft that have been recently delivered, and the newer generations and the fleet sizes are significantly larger than the older ones. So I think that's going to mitigate it. And you look at also the additional products that we offer now in particular with the Wencor acquisition and the display units and all that stuff, we have significantly higher content on these newer aircraft. So I think that's going to mitigate it. And then also anecdotally, I can tell you that there are a number of airlines who are in fact, operating, as you suggested, older aircraft. But I can tell you, and don't exactly quote me on this because if I'm getting it slightly mixed up, I don't want -- but directionally, you'll understand what I'm saying. For example, on the A320, I think there is not a fifth heavy maintenance check. So they're continuing -- a number of airlines are continuing to operate this aircraft to the end of the fifth maintenance check where they had been planning on doing it. That is not creating any revenue for us. So I think that there is a certain amount of older aircraft that continue to fly which aren't generating maintenance dollars. And that stuff is going to be pulled out. So I think you look at all this together -- and I'm very bullish. I mean we are not -- the team members at HEICO, the leadership, my family, we are not invested in HEICO for any one cycle. We're invested because we think that this is a very, very excellent space to be with both commercial travel, business and leisure, as well as defense for decades. And there will inevitably be little bumps here and there. But the truth is not even the experts in the industry know where this is going to come out. And historically, we've always sailed right through those periods. So I can tell you from an operating perspective, that doesn't change our direction of travel or our focus on developing new products or making sure we have inventory on the shelf. Because whenever we've been tried -- whenever, historically, we've tried to be if you will, too cute and too smart, you miss it. And we -- HEICO's strength is because we had the parts on the shelf when no one else did. Yes. I think they are complementary. I think they are complementary. I think that a lot of the release mechanisms are sold to TransDigm, and they're very complementary in the market. Yes. I would say it's all the same. I'm not aware of any major trends in one particular area versus the other. I mean there are always puts and takes in the quarter based on a million factors, frankly, we don't even understand. But no, I'd say that the strength was very, very broad based. No. I think we've done a great job, but I think that there is more. And I think -- I don't want to tip our competitors off as to additional stuff that we can do, but I think that there is still plenty of gas in the tank there. And as I've said before, Wencor is going to be -- the combination of HEICO and Wencor is going to be the gift that keeps on giving. And I think that there is a lot of additional areas where the businesses can benefit from one another, the customers can benefit. Frankly, we've got promotion opportunities within the company. There is a lot of, as we continue to acquire businesses, we need more -- we need additional team members to step up and take more responsibility. And I think that when we look at the HEICO and the Wencor team members, really, the sky is the limit for them. For folks who want to work hard and want to take on more responsibility, we have a lot of, whether it's acquisitions or whether it's organic growth, I mean, my gosh, 17% organic growth in the quarter, I mean, that's like a breakneck pace. And that's creating all sorts of promotional opportunities for people. The acquisitions they're creating, promotional opportunities for people. There's additional stuff that we can do on, in particular, on the repair side, sharing even more repairs, frankly, across our businesses. There is a lot of stuff that can be done. But when you're growing at 17%, it's hard just to keep up before you do all that stuff. So where are we? I would say we are definitely, for sure, in the first half. Where are we? We may even be at the first quarter. I think there is a lot more. But it's going to happen over time. It's not going to be something right away, and it is going to work out very well to people's personal career opportunities as they take on more, because I can tell you we've got so many acquisitions in the hopper and one of the greatest constraints that we have is not having enough internal people who we can promote to take on more responsibility at acquisitions. And sometimes we have to pass on acquisitions because we don't have those internal people. So I think there is going to be a very big opportunity. Yes. We think -- Tony, this is Eric. We think the display unit is a really good market to be in. We already do some displays. I can tell you that these displays in particular would be extremely difficult, if not impossible to do unless it was the way that we did it, through the purchase of the Honeywell IP, to be able to overhaul these. So I think that -- that's very important. And we can take their IP and their product and then we are able to combine that with the HEICO high-quality and turn-time that our customers have come to expect, and deliver a terrific product. So I'm very, very excited about this. It really fits extremely nicely within our avionics package at HEICO. Thank you. And we're glad that you're safe with our Capewell releases. I think we are having a technical challenge. This is Eric. So I would like to thank everybody for participating on our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you at our -- on our fourth quarter call towards the end of December. If anybody has any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Carlos, to Victor or me or our dad, and we're happy to speak with you and answer whatever additional questions you have. We thank you very much for your interest in HEICO. We hope you appreciate the great results that we've put forth today and look forward to a terrific fourth quarter. So stay well and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you very much. This concludes the call."

I now turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you very much, Samara, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO second quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and the President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another excellent quarter. Your focus on customers and operational excellence has provided record quarterly results for our shareholders, and I remain extremely optimistic about HEICO's future. I also want to thank everyone on the call, the HEICO team members and our customers and vendors who themselves or family members have served this great country. Some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. I hope you had these patriots in your port on Memorial Day. HEICO is proud of the role we play in support of the armed forces of the United States and our allies. I will summarize the highlights of the second quarter fiscal '24 results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO an improved by 33% and 39%, respectively, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. The results mainly reflect 21% organic net sales growth in the Flight Support aftermarket replacement parts and the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as improved results at ETG. Consolidated net income increased 17% to a record $123.1 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $105.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated EBITDA increased 35% to $252.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $187.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Our consolidated EBITDA margin was a very healthy 26.4% in the second quarter of fiscal '24. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the second quarter of fiscal '24, improving an enormous of 65% and 49%, respectively, over the second quarter of fiscal '23. The increase principally reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and strong 12% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand for Flight Support Group, aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts services. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.45x as of April 30, '24 and that was down from 3.04x as of October 31, '23. We remain on track to lower our leverage to 2x within 12 to 18 months post the Wencor acquisition. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 82% to $141.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $77.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and the President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the second quarter results of the Flight Support Group.\nEric Mendelson: Thank you very much. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 65% to a record $647.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $392.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects 21% organic growth within our aftermarket replacement parts product line. Both the legacy hikes in Wencor operations continue to exceed our expectations, and the results prove that Wencor was an excellent investment for HEICO. Both HEICO's and Wencor's entrepreneurial culture and a record of producing high-quality products continues to produce wins in the marketplace. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs. Consistent with HEICO's time-tested and well-known operating philosophy, we continue to operate Wencor as a stand-alone business operation. However, we have made good progress working together and serving our customers. Some examples of how we are now working together include the utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all repair stations, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation where appropriate, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO noncompetitive PMAs. Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base to quote new products, Engineering and regulatory cooperation that we expect to yield tremendous benefits for our company and sharing best-in-class vendors. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 49% to a record $148.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $99.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth. Partially offset by higher as expected intangible asset amortization expense due to the Wencor acquisition. The prior year impact from the amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement and increased inventory obsolescence expense. The price of Work Group's operating margin was 23% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 25.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangibles amortization in the second quarter of 2024, consumed around 280 basis points of our operating margin. The FSG cash margin before that amortization, otherwise known as EBITDA, was around 25.8%, which is excellent in absolute terms, and we are extremely pleased with it. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the prior year impact from the previously mentioned amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement and the previously mentioned higher intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense as a percentage of net sales. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the second quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 6% to $319.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $301.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase is attributable to 4% organic growth, mainly reflecting double-digit organic net sales growth of defense and aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of other electronic products. We were very pleased to see this core ETG end market gained traction in the past quarter even sooner than we had previously expected. As we previously thought it would more likely be an early third quarter event when we would see that turn up. While we continue to expect quarterly variation in lumpiness in our defense net sales, we believe the overall trend over the long term will remain positive. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $75.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin and the previously mentioned net sales growth. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects increased net sales of defense products partially offset by our expected decreased other electronics products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 23.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 up from 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangibles amortization consumes around 400 basis points of our operating margin, the ETG cash margin before that amortization was around 27.5%, which is excellent in absolute terms, and we are very pleased with it. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin and net sales growth, partially offset by lower SG&A efficiencies. Growth in net sales of defense and commercial aerospace product sales contributed to a favorable product mix during the second quarter, and we note that we finished the quarter with a record order backlog. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both FSG and ETG, principally driven by contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as demand for the majority of our products. Notably, we remain optimistic on the ETG's opportunity to expand and grow its net sales of defense-related products over the next six months of fiscal '24 and that is supported by a strong backlog. Additionally, we plan to continue our commitment to developing new products and services, and further market penetration while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In closing, I would like to thank our dedicated and loyal team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Our dedication to customers, team members and the production of high-quality, highly engineered niche products continues to be a winning strategy in the marketplace. The end markets we serve remain very healthy, and I'm highly optimistic about HEICO'S future. Thanks for all you do to make HEICO a great company. And now, I would like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning, everybody. Congrats on another just excellent quarter. I wanted to dig into the businesses a little bit. So, Victor, I would start with you and then Eric, I have something for you as well. But Victor, in -- you just talked about your margins and the mix improvement, and it sounds like the second half should be better, especially based on your prior comments. I think, saying something like 24% for the full year. So that implies a step-up here in the second half. And is that a good number for next year? In other words, are we starting to move back toward the margins of a couple of years ago? Or does that depreciation keep us forgetting there?\nVictor Mendelson: Rob, I'm going to dive in here because I've had a bunch of conversations with analysts about this topic, maybe a little confusion. The 24% that's been battered around that is what we aspire the segment's margin to elevate to. I don't know that we'll get there for the full year being an average of 24%. My comments last quarter were that -- yes, my comments last quarter that as the defense came back, that would be accretive to our margin, which we expected to come in the second half. And I thought sometime during this fiscal year, we posted a quarter at 24% plus, and that's kind of where we're at.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Victor, I have a little bit more qualitative one then for you. And thinking about your data microwave division, you've got Connect Tech there, which is one of NVIDIA's largest global hardware partners and want to see if you're seeing an acceleration in orders or RFPs there and other businesses within ETG to support all of this demand for data centers?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Rob, good question. Connect Tech definitely is seeing increased demand for data centers and on NVIDIA products. And I would expect that to continue. Now while Connect Tech is not a huge part of our company, it's important and it's a great business. In terms of the other companies, I don't think we're seeing a lot related to data centers. It's not a material part of our business in ETG.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then, Eric, just quickly, in your business, just outstanding organic aftermarket parts growth at 21%. And I asked you this question in the past, but is there any way to parse that in terms of -- for lack of a better expression, sort of same store parts growth, same customers, same parts versus pricing, versus market share gains? In other words, what's driving the 21%?\nEric Mendelson: Rob, this is Eric. So, as you know, we operate a very decentralized business. And in order to drive -- to capture those numbers from all of the business units, it would be very difficult that we don't capture that. So, I don't know the specific finite answer to that. But I can tell you that we've gotten a little bit of pricing. As I've mentioned on prior calls that our customers are very comfortable with our need to test on our increases in the cost to manufacture and our cost to do business. And so, in order to maintain our margins, our prices have to go up by at least that amount. So, they understand that, and we've been able to do that. So, there has been a certain amount in terms of price increase -- cost increases driving price increases. And then as far as the balance, I don't have the, as I said, the specific numbers in front of me, but my guess is that it's probably I don't know, half and half, half existing product increased penetration and half the sale of new products that hadn't been sold in the year ago period. That would be might get -- some of the businesses do capture this. So, I am able to see it for certain companies. And that's why I'm able to say what I just said but that's sort of my feeling on it. But we are not a price increase story. So, it's -- we're not driving these 21% return, a 21% increase is because we're raising price 21%. My guess is that price would be far less than 1/3, maybe even less than -- even less than 1/4 of that number. So, most of it would be volume increases.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just as a final sort of follow-up to that. We know that turnaround times for LEAP and GTF engines are significantly longer than they are for the prior gen CFM56 and V2500 and part of this is the lack of approved DRs and PMAs for LEAP GTF. So, knowing that these programs are early in their life cycle, I wanted to see if you've started to work on those and what kind of ramp we might expect for HEICO's activity or FSG's activity on these two new engine types?\nEric Mendelson: So, Rob, that's a great question. And as you know, we're very sensitive about giving specific information due to competitive reasons, as you can imagine, on any particular platform. But I can tell you that we have our eyes on new platform opportunities. Yes, we're willing to develop some product based on speculation that we'll be able to sell it. But we really need to make sure that the customers will be there and commit to us. You pointed out in your question, the basis and the reason why we exist and why our customers want us to exist. And I agree with you. I think that if there were alternative sources of supply, the situation wouldn't be as dire as it is. But at the moment, I'm going to have to pass on really where we are at that point. But needless to say, we've got people focused on all parts of the market.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great quarter. Thank you so much. Eric, just on your prepared remarks, you made a few comments about Wencor and how you're working together and you're starting to see those results. I was wondering if you could quantify that in any way or how you're tracking that internally. Are you looking into a part sold into a certain customer and the increase as you combine the sales force? Maybe if you could elaborate there.\nEric Mendelson: Got it. So, the answer is we don't specifically capture what those numbers are. It's very hard to capture. And what we're just trying to do is get the businesses to do what's in their interest and to do what's in their customers' interest and the combined HEICO interest. So unfortunately, I don't have a number, but I can tell you that just breaking down, looking at the various areas, the use of the Wencor PMAs, Wencor and HEICO PMAs and DERs at the repair station is very significant. We always said that the product selections from both companies were was extremely complementary. There was not a lot of overlap. So, you can just imagine when overhauling an LRU by being able to purchase each other's PMAs, which, to a certain extent, was done pre-acquisition but by being able to use each other's DERs and being able to rationalize where we overhaul these products. We've got multiple repair stations that are obviously strong in certain areas and weaker in other areas, and they've been able to buy themselves and without me orchestrating this they've been able to share technology and figure out where it makes sense to swap product line, swap technologies. And as a result, it's really hard to measure this stuff. So, we really don't even try. As far as the aftermarket sales cooperation, I'd say that's been excellent in terms of opening doors for each other. We've had meetings with airlines who are so excited that we have the potential of putting all of these increased number of products together and really provide a very, very unique service. And I can tell you, the airline support has been extraordinary. We thought that it would be good but it is really off the charts outstanding. In terms of the defense aftermarket, we've already -- that there are all sorts of examples where in the international market, we were procuring parts from other sources. Now, we're buying the legacy HEICO companies are buying it from the Wencor companies and vice versa. So that's working extremely well. Having the -- we are able to see when we list the HEICO parts on the Wencor platform, we are able to see what that is, and that's been excellent and very good. In terms of manufacturing new products down the road, Wencor has a very aggressive new product development program and having all of the 10 HEICO manufacturing businesses open to manufacture products makes a lot of sense, and I think it's really going to benefit future of course, that hasn't benefited yet. It benefited the numbers. In terms of engineering and regulatory cooperation, that's substantial by pooling the talents of both businesses we're able to get a lot more done. And I can tell you in discussions also with the FAA, they're very excited about that as well. And then obviously, sharing best-in-class vendors. So, I'm sorry that I can't give you a specific number, but I think you see it in our organic growth and in our margin expansion, which is frankly beyond where I thought we would be. And I'm just so happy with the results that I'm letting them speak for themselves.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: No, I really appreciate that, Eric. And then maybe I wanted to ask another one on price. I know you said that top line contribution is about 1/3 or 1/4 of your growth. How do we think about that net price impact? And should we see that discount to the OEM narrow as it widened throughout the last four years? Do we see that narrow? And do, we see the Wencor coming through in all your efforts coming through with new product development and higher net price even as inflation comes down. Does that make sense?\nEric Mendelson: No, yes. I understand your question, and I can tell you that how the prices that we sell as a percentage of OEM, I would say, are unfortunately at an all-time low. So, the OEMs have raised prices faster than we have raised prices. We want to make sure that, as I said, we need to pass on -- nobody wants a price increase. And while it appears easy, I must say that I understand, I know what it feels to walk in our sales to choose trying to get these price increases because even though costs are going up, nobody wants to take a price increase, especially when you when you're delivering so much value. So, while we have been successful in recapturing our increased costs and plus a little bit in some cases, at the percentage of OEM at which we sell our parts is, as I said, at an all-time low. And we're in the market capture space, and we think that we can continue to drive exceptional value for our customers by maintaining this philosophy.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deutsche: Carlos, can you give us an update on the operating margins you think FSG should be able to do this year? It looks like you're tracking a good bit higher than the 21% to 22% range you outlined previously?\nCarlos Macau: The FSG is performing exceptionally well right now. And the caution I'll throw at you is, number one, obviously, we are a conservative bunch. And I'm not sure at this point once we get through this, what I'll call, exceptional growth period and the mix within the segment kind of flattens out or settles out. I'm still thinking that maybe it's towards the high end of '22 for sort of thinking out long term once we settle in. But I wouldn't -- I don't want to guide or get you guys thinking about us having 23-plus percent margins. Now, I don't see impediments in front of us to continue to have these strong margins, but I do think that as the footprint settles down, we'll just see a natural tendency to -- has the margin come down a little. And by the way, the reason for that is during the quarter, we had exceptional growth in our aftermarket parts business. Repair and overhaul were strong, not as strong as a parts business. And Specialty Products is a little flat on the commercial OEM product build side. So, I think as those segments, their growth patterns get back to normal, we might see a slight depression of that 23%, but not a ton. Does that answer your question, Sir?\nScott Deutsche: Yes, it does. I mean you did 22.5 -- 22.5% in the first half and typically your second half stronger. I'm just trying to figure out what drives it down second half for first half? It sounds like that's kind of what you're teeing out?\nCarlos Macau: At some point, it's got me miss I'm not so sure that we are going to lose momentum in what I'll call exceptional growth this year. So, we probably will have margins that bounce around. But I can't predict the exceptionalism of our team members. I mean, the operations and the way they're running the business now to keep up with the demand that's out there to deal with this growth and employees and everything. They're just doing an exceptional job. So, I hope this margin would continue. I'm just cautioning you that my view is once the mix settles in, we're running 21 to 22, we're going to be very happy as a management team.\nEric Mendelson: And Scott, this is Eric. Scott, this is Eric. And I can tell you, this is a shout-out to our many team members who I think are on this call. But HEICO has got the biggest bunch of sandbaggers that you've ever -- that I've ever seen. And one, they're super talented. This is not meant to take away from their achievements because their achievements are nothing short of incredible and amazing. However, having said that, as Carlos said, they tend to be very conservative. We joke around internally. Carlos and I call them sandbaggers. They know who they are.\nScott Deutsche: I think Carlos is a sandbagger too.\nEric Mendelson: I understand that we're just taking these numbers and rolling them up and when we go and talk to them about common, you're performing at this, why is the number going to go down? They've got 22 possible reasons, including a meteor strike and all sorts of crazy stuff that could cause it. And as a result, we really take up the numbers and we even had a positive contingency very often to it because we know that they're low. But it is very -- it's very hard to quantify. And the reason I don't if you will, fight the sandbagging is because it encourages them to look at all of the areas of potential risk. There are all sorts of -- there's -- it's a Herculean effort to achieve these numbers. And there are all sorts of things that can go wrong in the supply chain and with technology and processes, all sorts of things. And they are very much focused on what can go wrong. And as a result, since they work so hard to mitigate those factors, they most of the time, almost always overperform. So that's sort of where we are in it. I mean we're hoping to do better. But based on the numbers that we've gotten, variations in the business cycle, this is what it rolls up to. So, we just sort of go with that.\nScott Deutsche: Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. Eric, I guess, while I have you, if I go back to 2022 and the first half of '23, the Specialty Products was growing like crazy. And I guess a lot of that was driven by munitions, but the growth rate has slowed quite a bit since then. So, I guess my question is, do you have a sense for when we might expect to see Specialty Products return to stronger growth profile and then what you need to see in order for that to happen?\nEric Mendelson: Got it. So, the short answer to that is in fiscal '25, we think is when it's going to happen. I do want to mention that actually, we don't make -- HEICO doesn't make any munitions I think what you're referring to is missile defense. So, we are very active on missile defense interceptors, and we have a high content there on other missile platforms. But typically, it's more in the defense area, although I suppose there is some in the offensive. But we don't make the explosives themselves. When you look at the numbers, we're anticipating next year is going to be very strong. We've had significant ramp-ups in a number of businesses. And we have significant orders on the books. And now we've just got to produce.\nCarlos Macau: Record backlog.\nEric Mendelson: Record backlog. We're really very, very good in the Specialty Products area. So I'm anticipating very good results in 2025 on that.\nCarlos Macau: But by the way, Scott, one thing to point out with that Defense Business just like in the ETG, it can be incredibly lumpy. And I think that's what Eric is pointing out, you have to ramp to serve these big projects. And their backlog is at record high, and we do expect good things in '25. Not to say this year, I don't expect growth. I'm just '25 on seem to be big growth for us in that area.\nScott Deutsche: Got it. And still margin accretive growth like it's historically been?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, on the defense side, that's correct.\nOperator: I'll take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nLarry Solow: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question, just on the disparity between the really great growth on the parts business, 21% and sort of the mid- to high single digits, it sounds like on repair-service and overhaul. Is that different or part of that difference where you're capturing market share gains? Or is that too simplified the way to look at it?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I think there are some market share gains there. Larry, this is Eric. There are market share gains. I think that in the parts area. Remember, our business -- we typically ship discrete parts. So, if we've got the part on the shelf, we're able to sell it, whereas in the component repair business, we're really beholden to the supply chain. We can have an LRU that's got a few hundred different part numbers in the bill of material and one part is being held up, which actually is the case in many different businesses, and we can't ship it. And we've got this big backlog, and it's basically just sitting there. And so that's sort of, I think, what's also going on there.\nLarry Solow: Got you. And a question maybe for Carlos. Just I did notice there was a bit of a contingency reversal in the quarter. Was that in FSG?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, it was. Yes, it was. So, this quarter, we had about -- it was like a net $4 million. It was a $6 million reduction in the contingency, and then we had some inventory reserves we took for our product line. And so, we had about a $4 million net pickup in the margin related to contingent earnout reversal. And that was due to an acquired contingent earnout due to Wencor acquisition.\nLarry Solow: Now remember, Wencor itself, yes, go ahead please\u2026\nCarlos Macau: Remember, that's on our numbers right now. That's maybe 0.5 point to the margin. Last year, we had, if you recall, in the same quarter we had a $9 million reversal for the renegotiations of a contingent earnout. And that was a little bit more impactful to margins. That was maybe 1.5% or something like that of the margin. So Net-net, it was actually a headwind for us this quarter.\nLarry Solow: Year-over-year, but maybe that gives us a little bit of a reason for a little bit of a sequential decline going to the back half of the year. It was a little bit of a benefit this quarter, I guess. And just in terms of Wencor\u2026\nCarlos Macau: I appreciate. I appreciate you supporting us on that.\nLarry Solow: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Just on one Wencor, Eric, you mentioned sort of this still operating as a standalone. And I think that as the beauty of HEICO and most of your subsidiaries kind of run autonomously. Being that Wencor is so large and somewhat has a lot of similarities in your core PMA parts business and distribution and whatnot. Are there opportunities to sort of merge -- blend those two companies more together than the normal HEICO where you operate?\nEric Mendelson: Larry, so that's a great question. A lot of people have wondered about that. And as you know, HEICO has the unique ability, which you don't typically find in a company of our size to operate businesses in the similar same spaces and to sort of direct traffic so they don't hurt each other and make sure that we maintain the entrepreneurial spirit. And I think that is the single most important thing that we can do. Just last week, I was at the Aerospace Industries Association Board of Governors meeting. And actually, PwC did a wonderful presentation speaking about what's going on in terms of the employment trends in the aerospace market. And what was interesting is that the lack of interest from people with regard to aerospace is not due to the mission of aerospace or even the defense part because some people are sensitive about that. And it's not due to the earnings level. It's due to the fact that when people join large companies, they feel pigeonhole and they don't feel like they have -- they're able to get a good experience. And I think that, that's the unique thing about HEICO. We recognize that there's no question there's synergy. If we can functionally put things together, we can drive certain processes, eliminate costs and do all that. But what it does in the process is it kills the entrepreneurial nature, the enthusiasm, the desire to stay up late, to work late to make sure that you accomplish what your customer needs where you have full responsibility for the product from selecting it, designing it, manufacturing it, procuring and inspecting it, selling it, accounting for it. And this is what is very, very motivational to our team. So, to answer your question, no, there's no plan to put this together. However, there is the opportunity to cooperate. And frankly, with the organic growth that we've got, if we could just have these businesses work together and become more efficient but still retain their entrepreneurial spirit and their individual focus. There are tremendous cost benefits by just giving our internal people the internal promotional opportunities and not having to go outside and hire more people. So, I don't see, if you will, cost synergies in terms of job reductions. But I do see the opportunity for our people to put their heads together and figure out -- we've already gotten to the point where one plus one equals two-and-half, but I think we're going to continue to focus to plus one plus one can equal three or four or five. And that's really the focus. And it's not going to be through job cuts, the way some other companies handle this kind of thing.\nLarry Solow: Got it. I appreciate that color. If I could just slip one in to Victor, if you guys don't mind, just 4% organic growth, double-digit dispense on the defense side. What was sort of stand out on the offsets on the negative side that kind of offset some of that growth on the other products. Anything extraordinary there?\nVictor Mendelson: Larry, thank you for the question. It's a good question, and I was feeling neglected. So glad to answer a question. But all kidding aside, the weakest part was the other markets, the non-aerospace and defense markets, which you may recall in the last couple or several calls. I said to anticipate that being lower, and I would expect order rates to start to tick up in the back half of the year. I'm not sure whether it's the third or fourth quarter, but we're certainly seeing some green shoots here and there, though not across the board. But that is the case. And it's really a result of customer inventory channels. They had stocked up and much the same way a lot of companies in our industry have done and our industries have done, and I think they're working off those inventories at this point, and that will continue for little bit longer, then you have a lead timing after the orders start to turn. So, we had a little lead time. So, I'm optimistic about those businesses, but I think we have probably I don't know, couple of quarters or so left to go on negative comparisons.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Thanks for all the details and great quarter. So, Eric, I wondered -- you made in your prepared remarks, you made some comments about kind of the partnership that you -- with Wencor and your traditional PMA business. You mentioned Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing-based new products. Curious to get more color on that, what kind of opportunity that is for Wencor.\nEric Mendelson: We think it's pretty substantial. Wencor has an excellent vendor base and they remain loyal to that vendor base. They're not, in general, moving product from established vendors who are making it. However, as you know, the industry supply is very tight right now, even in the HEICO businesses. And we have the opportunity to redirect capacity, frankly, in our Specialty Products more towards the HEICO businesses. And I've been out there working with the Head of our Specialty Products Group and I are working with our individual businesses to explain the virtue of manufacturing for HEICO and Wencor as opposed to only third-party customers because when third-party customers, they're great, and we want to stay focused on them as well. But when it's an internal customer, you know very clearly what's going on competitively and we're able to move priorities for them. So and also able to really focus on the quality. I mean, that's been a key focus for HEICO and for Wencor in terms of making sure that the products that we supply are the absolute best in the industry. So, I think this is something that will start to pay dividends in 2025 and after, both in terms of more timely deliveries, our internal customers as well as, frankly, a profit margin that our specialty products companies can make by supplying these high-quality parts to the HEICO companies. There's a lot of stuff that we can do. There are 10 different businesses in our specialty products group, and they all have unique capability. And we -- I think there is opportunity in the vast majority of them.\nPeter Arment: Perfect. That's great color. And then just, Eric, just staying with you on just what you're seeing from an international travel perspective, are you seeing any pockets of strength or weakness or anything to call out on a regional basis? Just curious on that.\nEric Mendelson: It's -- so I spoke with all of our sales heads last week and on overall the details, and we're seeing tremendous strength around the world. The Americas remains strong as well as Europe and Asia, Middle East, China. So, we're seeing very good strength across the board. The market seems extremely strong. People want to travel, both for business as well as leisure, so things look good. I wouldn't say there's one or two areas of particular strength. I'd say it's very broad-based.\nPeter Arment: Great. And then just quickly on Victor on you had some, I guess, some timing delays in Q1. Just how is the supply chain are looking for your ETG when you think about, obviously, kind of the back half of the year?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, this is Victor. So, I think our supply chain has pretty much returned mostly to normal. I don't think companies talk too much about and focus too much about supply chain issues, small supply chain issues that were in the noise level then. But certainly, people are no longer afraid to do that. But it seems to me as though things are maybe not quite entirely back to normal, but fairly close. There are still some pockets here and there where some lead times are extended or deliveries are delayed but again, I -- my sense of it is that wasn't unheard of before the pandemic either. We just didn't really hear much about it.\nPeter Arment: Okay. And your R&D efforts, Victor, I know you guys called that out in Q1, just -- is that for existing orders? Or is there new opportunities that really you're pursuing?\nVictor Mendelson: It's a combination. I mean our R&D activities in ETG remain very strong. It's a key part of what we do. And that's for some of customer funded, it shows up as revenue, NRE and things like that. But a lot of it is related to product development for future products. And in the aerospace industry, generally speaking, R&D expenses to start something today, it takes time years before it turns into revenue or meaningful revenue. So, we have to keep that constant investment going. I think it's something we've been very successful with in our subsidiaries have been very successful with over a long period of time.\nCarlos Macau: Yes, Peter, we spend roughly 3%, sometimes 4% of sales on R&D. That's pretty consistent. That's what we saw this quarter, company-wide, I should.\nEric Mendelson: And ETG is probably higher than that for a variety of reasons because we have some businesses, ETG is probably above 5% on R&D.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate all the details.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Thank you for the question. Victor, maybe just to start with you. You get some good color on ETG, what's in there. You've seen a little bit of volatility in our organic growth over the last several quarters as we think forward, do you expect that to stabilize? And do you still see that group in track for the mid-single-digit growth you thought you would see in '24?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes. Historically, this has been the case for ETG that it's volatile growth quarter-by-quarter. And I would expect that to continue to be the case. I don't think we've suddenly reached a different run rate. But I think the overall trend is a positive and upward trend, that's supported by the backlog, it's supported by quote activity and other things.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. And then, Eric, one for you.\nVictor Mendelson: And Carlos is going to add that.\nCarlos Macau: I just want to add Bert, we still expect low to mid-single-digit growth in ETG for the year, which that statement implies volatility if you think about what we've done to date versus the next two quarters. So, I think Bert is right, it\u2019s going to be up and down, but we do expect the low to mid-single-digit growth for the year organically.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. On the FSG side, just a question for you, Eric, maybe just a little more-high level. A lot of what you're seeing would seem like on the volume side for parts and in terms of what you're expecting in repairs has been driven by a variety of macro features. But largely the combination of the aging global fleet air travel demand, what we've seen there and just depressed inventory. Carlos, you made some comments about some normalization in what you're seeing today over time. Like how do you think about those macro trends as you look out? It sounds like from what you were saying, Eric, you seeing strength across the board. Is there anything concern you that, that might change in the near term?\nEric Mendelson: So, Bert, that's something that we think about all the time. However, in order to be in this industry, you've got to really have a long-term view. And we never know what's going to come around the corner, but we've got to be well positioned for everything. So, we're fundamental believers in commercial and military aviation. We think that these are really good spaces to be in. We understand them extraordinarily well. We're really appreciated by our customers. Yes, there is tremendous strength, yes, there is a certain percentage of the fleet that's down as a result of issues that are going on, but we also have a fleet -- a massive fleet of 20,000 something to aircraft that's aging one year per year. And most of the other major players out there increased price very substantially. So, we think that we're in a very good area, could there be a little air pocket here or there, sure, that could absolutely happen, but that's why we don't like to be over-levered. And we want to make sure that we've got plenty of cash to always do the right thing to continue our successful acquisition program, which is key to everything we do. And we're going to be very strong no matter what happens out there. So and then also to point out the obvious, I mean, every roughly nine years, 10 years or so, there's always some black swan event. The last one, of course, is the most dramatic but look at how strong we've emerged from it. And when we look at our sales as a percentage of what we were doing in 2019, I mean, this company has absolutely transformed for the better and grown tremendously, both organically and via acquisition since then. So, we don't worry about, if you will, the little air pockets or what could be happening down the road. I mean I could paint a scenario where, I mean, look, we hope that the new manufacturer gets strengthened out because we have -- we can benefit very well as a result of that. And we hope the world economy remains strong and people want to trap and all that capacity is soaked up, it becomes impossible for any anybody to calculate. So, we just keep our heads down and focus on the business, and I'm very confident we're going to do well.\nBert Subin: Thank you, Eric. Just one quick follow-up for Carlos. On the interest expense side, Eric just mentioned not wanting to over leverage. You guys started to pay down some debt. Should we still expect interest expense to sort of follow the same glide path that you were talking about last quarter?\nCarlos Macau: Yes, I think so I think I'm not counting on any movements really in the interest rate. We probably will wind up running 30 -- I think we ran $38 million this quarter. It's probably going to be down $1 million each quarter after this or so just from debt from principal paydowns. So that's probably what we're going to see this year as we continue to delever that will be the interest expense.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kenneth Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Herbert: Good morning and a really nice quarter. Eric, maybe just to start off. When we think about your -- the aerospace sales within the FSG segment, can you remind us the mix of what you're selling that's under long-term contracts versus maybe what was more book and ship?\nEric Mendelson: I don't have that information in front of me. But our -- I'm getting it's in when you go across all of the businesses, I'm guessing it's in sort of the 50-50 area. But I don't have that specific information. As a result, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of the decentralized structure. We don't capture a lot of that information. But my guess is it's probably around the half and half area.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. And are you maybe organizationally trying to skew maybe one way or the other is you have contracts coming up for renewals, say, with some of your large airline customers are you trying to in the businesses drive them to maybe more of a book-and-ship scenario? Or strategically, is that something you're comfortable to citing the operating units do what's best?\nEric Mendelson: Well, so my comment about the 50-50 is looking at our entire parts business, which includes both PMA and distribution. So, I think the distribution will probably due to less contracts, in other words, less than 50%, and the PMA would be more than 50%. So that's sort of the dichotomy there that I was looking at. Our customers with regard to PMA, they like the idea of having a long-term agreement, and we like that idea too because we can go out and procure the product for them and protect them. Clearly, if they want to be protected on price, we're happy to do that. But in turn, they've got to commit to us. So definitely, on the PMA side, the percentage of contracts would be -- I'm guessing well over 50%.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just finally, Victor, to put a finer point on sort of the lumpiness. You're up against some pretty tough comps within the Defense and Space sales within ETG in the second half of this year, especially in the fourth quarter. Do you -- is it fair to assume that you're seeing backlog that we should still see growth in the defense businesses into the back half of this year? Or could we maybe see those down a little bit just considering the strength in the back half of '23?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, I'd like to see how it plays out. I'm feeling good at the moment about the third quarter. And I think the fourth, if I look at the shipment schedules, it's flatter, more challenging. But I think we had like a 6% organic growth. I think in Q4 ETG last year so that's a tough comp. Yes, so it's going to be a tough one. I think we have to let play out. We'll see where it goes. I don't think it's so easy, but we'll see where it goes.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sam Struhsaker with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nSam Struhsaker: Sam on for Mike Ciarmoli. Nice quarter. I was just curious kind of looking at the support -- or sorry, the strength in aftermarket. Could you guys maybe try and break that out a little bit more. Was there any particular areas of strength or weakness, whether it be across airfreight engines interiors or even not weakness, but certain areas that you were seeing more growth from versus others?\nEric Mendelson: I would say, overall, it was very broad-based. In the quarter, it's hard to sort of get into it by particular product type and that can be sort of heavily skewed depending on what inventory packages are taking place. So, at the moment, I think it would be misleading for me to get into that because people would extrapolate and view it perhaps not correctly. If you don't mind, I'd rather punt and talk about that perhaps next quarter as we start to see some of this. But as I mentioned earlier, it does appear to be very broad-based the support is really broad-based.\nSam Struhsaker: Fair enough. And then obviously, you guys are still sort of working on the integration of Wencor, but how are you guys kind of thinking about M&A going forward in the long term?\nEric Mendelson: We are fully 100% committed to M&A. It is a key part of HEICO's strategy, and it drives a nice chunk of our growth. We as you can see, we were over 3x levered after we completed the Wencor acquisition. And then we also purchased the Honeywell display unit product line. Now we're down to 2.45x. Our M&A teams are very, very focused in finding great companies. We're in discussions with many. We work really hard to be the acquirer of choice. I think that we are sort of lucky and fortunate in that our competitive advantage is this decentralized model, which appeals to people very well. I mean, I can tell you, when I visit companies, even in processes, I would say, at least four out of five leadership teams tell us that HEICO is their preferred acquirer. And of course, who knows what they tell all the different bidders out there. But I really do believe that our approach is unique and people want a part of it, and we are very, very much focused. And also, it's supported by our customers. I mean it was our customers who wanted and we were so excited about the Wencor acquisition because we could put these two product lines together and really offer much more of a competitive offering to our airline customers. I mean they were the ones most supportive of doing this. So ,we're going to remain very, very active in that area.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nLouis Raffetto: Great. Eric, just a couple for you. I think FSG sales were up about 5% sequentially, but if I look at your acquired growth and thinking about Wencor in the Honeywell product line, it looks like Wencor sales were flat to even down sequentially while legacy was up mid-single digits. Is that sort of the right way to think about it?\nEric Mendelson: I mean, we don't get into the specifics, but no. I mean, I wouldn't say that on Wencor sales were down. I mean Wencor quarter is performing extremely well. They're way up as compared to last year. So, they're performing well. I mean, look at any of the businesses, you've got this -- we're at the mercy of the supply chain. And I can tell you that we've got a lot of suppliers who are very, very late. And that can sway quarters significantly actually. But Wencor is performing extraordinarily well, winning new business, we couldn't be happier.\nLouis Raffetto: All right, appreciate the insights. And Interesting to hear about, you got the only one mentioned the parts supply is sort of limiting the MRO. So just good for that insight. And I guess you would -- I know Eric kind of confirmed the low or Carlos confirmed the low to mid-single-digit growth for ETG. I mean, I think you guys kind of laid out high single-digit to low double-digit growth for FSG. I mean it seems like you're certainly going to be at the high end of that, if not above that. Is that a fair assumption?\nCarlos Macau: I think, we're going to stick with the high to low double-digit growth for the year. I think that's still a good assumption, Louis.\nOperator: And next, we'll take our question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks for staying on and talk to Eric. So, I was curious, how far long are you guys on kind of introducing when course product suite to your -- to HEICO's legacy airline customers and vice versa? I know there was a whole the comment when the deal was announced that Wencor was bigger with the MRO facilities than with HEICO and you guys were stronger at the airlines. I'm just curious like how much time does it take to kind of make those introductions and have those -- the product catalog added to the contracts that you guys already have each of those companies already have.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. So, Gautam, I think what you're referring to is we said that historically, Wencor originally got its it sort of focus was more in the repair stations. They still dealt with the airlines, but more of their focus originally was in the repair stations, and it was sort of vice versa with HEICO. But I can tell you that the cooperation is going extremely well. We are -- both companies are helping each other. And there are airline customers where Wencor had more of a presence in their airline customers where HEICO had more of a presence. And we are introducing the folks on both sides so they can go ahead and take advantage of those relationships in that history and be able to sell the products. So, I think that, that is happening as we speak. And I anticipate that that's going to continue to occur in 2025. I think we will continue to see the very good results in that area.\nGautam Khanna: Has there already been traction like commercial traction you guys are already getting sales from some of that cross-selling opportunity? Or is it still on the comp?\nEric Mendelson: No, no. We have received sales on it. And I think that's one of the reasons you see the organic growth rate, and you see the margins that we have because we've already realized the benefits. I think there's a lot more to come. And -- but we recognize them thus far.\nGautam Khanna: Got you. That's helpful. And then, Carlos, I know you addressed this earlier in the call, but just do you have a better sense of the long-term FSG margin framework? At one point, it was 22% long term. I know there's reasons you guys are over that now. But is that still kind of the right bogey longer term with Wencor? Or do you think it could be structurally higher than?\nCarlos Macau: I think the long-term margin probably is around that 22% rate. And I do think that if you look back over the -- if you sort of ignore the COVID period and look back over the decade prior to that, you will see that our margin is pretty consistent and that every year, we get a little improvement in it. I think we're going to be -- we're heading towards that pace to where we get back as I mentioned earlier, to a normal footprint within the segment when the mix is kind of what it used to look like, and then we move forward from there and he got those little efficiencies. That's my expectation long time.\nEric Mendelson: And of course, Gautam, this is Eric. We've got, as I mentioned, in the quarter, we had 280 basis points from intangible amortization. So, you add that and we're really approaching 25% on an EBITDA basis, which is outstanding.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, absolutely. And then last one, Eric, just in terms of product introductions, I know in the past, you talked about 300 to 500 PMA parts developed each year. What's the right number now that you own in Wencor have some experience with them? Is it higher than that? Or is it a number, 300 to 500.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would think it's closer to the 500 area. Wencor continues to focus and develop a very aggressive number of products. HEICO, obviously, the same. The key is getting all those parts manufactured and getting the airlines to buy them. So, we've got the capability, and we continue to we're not going to cut back in any of that area.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nLouie DiPalma: Eric, Victor and Carlos, good morning. One of the recurring themes on both the ETG side of the business is your ability to consistently introduce new products to the market. You just mentioned the target of 500 new PMA parts per year. Similarly, I was wondering what is ETG doing in terms of new products per year. And is there still a long runway? And is the Ukraine more inspiring new ideas and demand for new types of products?\nVictor Mendelson: Louie, this is Victor. Thank you. It's a very good question. I don't know the number of new products and new part numbers we actually introduced in the ETG each year because it's a very large number, and we have so many subsidiaries. But one of the things that we do look at when we meet with the Company is each year, we do an annual meeting and do a budget review and a bottoms-up budget. We do look at with each one their new product introduction. And it is a very active and regular rate. And I think it's -- my sense of it is it's probably higher than most people I see in the industry. So very, very happy with that. And that will continue, and that was my lesion earlier to the R&D spending and why it's so critical for us to do in good times or in bad, we don't cut R&D spending if the business is weaker in a particular moment because ultimately, that's our salvation, right? And that's how we grow the business over time. And we look at it on a very long-term basis. In terms of Ukraine, yes, Ukraine has meant more new product introduction in some of our businesses and has stimulated sales in a number of our businesses as well. And it's -- Ukraine's had an interesting effect because I think it is reminded our allies in Europe, our friends of the need to expand their defense spending sustainably in long term. And that's happened, right? And that's happening, and we're seeing more investment there. The Company we acquired, we completed the acquisition in January 23 of Exxelia, which is a company headquartered in France with significant operations and sales in Europe. And that was one of the things that attracted us to that business was the opportunity to offer products to our friends and allies as well as, by the way, here in the U.S. and the Ukraine war does have an impact on U.S. companies. And obviously, as we know, what the U.S. supplies. So, I would expect that to continue. And then when that conflict in, and I hope it is soon, of course, but when that ends, I think it will have an enduring effect on how people look at defending themselves and what they spend to do it.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And I think you have a number of microwave product and components. Are you supplying to some of the microwave OEMs in terms of like air defense and counter drone functionality?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. And of course, as you can imagine, I can't point out specific programs, but I can say that is part of -- that is definitely part of the business and it's within the end of what we do.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nLaurans Mendelson: So, this is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. We look forward to speaking with you when we report third quarter results and that will be some time about three months from now. So meanwhile, have a very good summer, enjoy summer, be safe. And HEICO will, I believe, do extremely well. Thank you, and that's the end of this call.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "The FSG is performing exceptionally well right now. And the caution I'll throw at you is, number one, obviously, we are a conservative bunch. And I'm not sure at this point once we get through this, what I'll call, exceptional growth period and the mix within the segment kind of flattens out or settles out. I'm still thinking that maybe it's towards the high end of '22 for sort of thinking out long term once we settle in. But I wouldn't -- I don't want to guide or get you guys thinking about us having 23-plus percent margins. Now, I don't see impediments in front of us to continue to have these strong margins, but I do think that as the footprint settles down, we'll just see a natural tendency to -- has the margin come down a little. And by the way, the reason for that is during the quarter, we had exceptional growth in our aftermarket parts business. Repair and overhaul were strong, not as strong as a parts business. And Specialty Products is a little flat on the commercial OEM product build side. So, I think as those segments, their growth patterns get back to normal, we might see a slight depression of that 23%, but not a ton. Does that answer your question, Sir? At some point, it's got me miss I'm not so sure that we are going to lose momentum in what I'll call exceptional growth this year. So, we probably will have margins that bounce around. But I can't predict the exceptionalism of our team members. I mean, the operations and the way they're running the business now to keep up with the demand that's out there to deal with this growth and employees and everything. They're just doing an exceptional job. So, I hope this margin would continue. I'm just cautioning you that my view is once the mix settles in, we're running 21 to 22, we're going to be very happy as a management team. Record backlog. But by the way, Scott, one thing to point out with that Defense Business just like in the ETG, it can be incredibly lumpy. And I think that's what Eric is pointing out, you have to ramp to serve these big projects. And their backlog is at record high, and we do expect good things in '25. Not to say this year, I don't expect growth. I'm just '25 on seem to be big growth for us in that area. Yes, on the defense side, that's correct. Yes, it was. Yes, it was. So, this quarter, we had about -- it was like a net $4 million. It was a $6 million reduction in the contingency, and then we had some inventory reserves we took for our product line. And so, we had about a $4 million net pickup in the margin related to contingent earnout reversal. And that was due to an acquired contingent earnout due to Wencor acquisition. Remember, that's on our numbers right now. That's maybe 0.5 point to the margin. Last year, we had, if you recall, in the same quarter we had a $9 million reversal for the renegotiations of a contingent earnout. And that was a little bit more impactful to margins. That was maybe 1.5% or something like that of the margin. So Net-net, it was actually a headwind for us this quarter. I appreciate. I appreciate you supporting us on that. Yes, Peter, we spend roughly 3%, sometimes 4% of sales on R&D. That's pretty consistent. That's what we saw this quarter, company-wide, I should. I just want to add Bert, we still expect low to mid-single-digit growth in ETG for the year, which that statement implies volatility if you think about what we've done to date versus the next two quarters. So, I think Bert is right, it's going to be up and down, but we do expect the low to mid-single-digit growth for the year organically. Yes, I think so I think I'm not counting on any movements really in the interest rate. We probably will wind up running 30 -- I think we ran $38 million this quarter. It's probably going to be down $1 million each quarter after this or so just from debt from principal paydowns. So that's probably what we're going to see this year as we continue to delever that will be the interest expense. I think, we're going to stick with the high to low double-digit growth for the year. I think that's still a good assumption, Louis. I think the long-term margin probably is around that 22% rate. And I do think that if you look back over the -- if you sort of ignore the COVID period and look back over the decade prior to that, you will see that our margin is pretty consistent and that every year, we get a little improvement in it. I think we're going to be -- we're heading towards that pace to where we get back as I mentioned earlier, to a normal footprint within the segment when the mix is kind of what it used to look like, and then we move forward from there and he got those little efficiencies. That's my expectation long time."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 6% to $319.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $301.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase is attributable to 4% organic growth, mainly reflecting double-digit organic net sales growth of defense and aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of other electronic products. We were very pleased to see this core ETG end market gained traction in the past quarter even sooner than we had previously expected. As we previously thought it would more likely be an early third quarter event when we would see that turn up. While we continue to expect quarterly variation in lumpiness in our defense net sales, we believe the overall trend over the long term will remain positive. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $75.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $68 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects an improved gross profit margin and the previously mentioned net sales growth. The improved gross profit margin principally reflects increased net sales of defense products partially offset by our expected decreased other electronics products net sales. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 23.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 up from 22.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangibles amortization consumes around 400 basis points of our operating margin, the ETG cash margin before that amortization was around 27.5%, which is excellent in absolute terms, and we are very pleased with it. The operating margin increase principally reflects the previously mentioned gross profit margin and net sales growth, partially offset by lower SG&A efficiencies. Growth in net sales of defense and commercial aerospace product sales contributed to a favorable product mix during the second quarter, and we note that we finished the quarter with a record order backlog. I'll turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Rob, I'm going to dive in here because I've had a bunch of conversations with analysts about this topic, maybe a little confusion. The 24% that's been battered around that is what we aspire the segment's margin to elevate to. I don't know that we'll get there for the full year being an average of 24%. My comments last quarter were that -- yes, my comments last quarter that as the defense came back, that would be accretive to our margin, which we expected to come in the second half. And I thought sometime during this fiscal year, we posted a quarter at 24% plus, and that's kind of where we're at. Yes. Rob, good question. Connect Tech definitely is seeing increased demand for data centers and on NVIDIA products. And I would expect that to continue. Now while Connect Tech is not a huge part of our company, it's important and it's a great business. In terms of the other companies, I don't think we're seeing a lot related to data centers. It's not a material part of our business in ETG. Larry, thank you for the question. It's a good question, and I was feeling neglected. So glad to answer a question. But all kidding aside, the weakest part was the other markets, the non-aerospace and defense markets, which you may recall in the last couple or several calls. I said to anticipate that being lower, and I would expect order rates to start to tick up in the back half of the year. I'm not sure whether it's the third or fourth quarter, but we're certainly seeing some green shoots here and there, though not across the board. But that is the case. And it's really a result of customer inventory channels. They had stocked up and much the same way a lot of companies in our industry have done and our industries have done, and I think they're working off those inventories at this point, and that will continue for little bit longer, then you have a lead timing after the orders start to turn. So, we had a little lead time. So, I'm optimistic about those businesses, but I think we have probably I don't know, couple of quarters or so left to go on negative comparisons. Yes, this is Victor. So, I think our supply chain has pretty much returned mostly to normal. I don't think companies talk too much about and focus too much about supply chain issues, small supply chain issues that were in the noise level then. But certainly, people are no longer afraid to do that. But it seems to me as though things are maybe not quite entirely back to normal, but fairly close. There are still some pockets here and there where some lead times are extended or deliveries are delayed but again, I -- my sense of it is that wasn't unheard of before the pandemic either. We just didn't really hear much about it. It's a combination. I mean our R&D activities in ETG remain very strong. It's a key part of what we do. And that's for some of customer funded, it shows up as revenue, NRE and things like that. But a lot of it is related to product development for future products. And in the aerospace industry, generally speaking, R&D expenses to start something today, it takes time years before it turns into revenue or meaningful revenue. So, we have to keep that constant investment going. I think it's something we've been very successful with in our subsidiaries have been very successful with over a long period of time. Yes. Historically, this has been the case for ETG that it's volatile growth quarter-by-quarter. And I would expect that to continue to be the case. I don't think we've suddenly reached a different run rate. But I think the overall trend is a positive and upward trend, that's supported by the backlog, it's supported by quote activity and other things. And Carlos is going to add that. Yes, I'd like to see how it plays out. I'm feeling good at the moment about the third quarter. And I think the fourth, if I look at the shipment schedules, it's flatter, more challenging. But I think we had like a 6% organic growth. I think in Q4 ETG last year so that's a tough comp. Yes, so it's going to be a tough one. I think we have to let play out. We'll see where it goes. I don't think it's so easy, but we'll see where it goes. Louie, this is Victor. Thank you. It's a very good question. I don't know the number of new products and new part numbers we actually introduced in the ETG each year because it's a very large number, and we have so many subsidiaries. But one of the things that we do look at when we meet with the Company is each year, we do an annual meeting and do a budget review and a bottoms-up budget. We do look at with each one their new product introduction. And it is a very active and regular rate.

            "content": "Thank you very much, Samara, and good morning to everyone on the call. We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to this HEICO second quarter fiscal '24 earnings announcement teleconference. I'm Larry Mendelson, Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. And I'm joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and the President of HEICO's Flight Support Group; Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment to thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another excellent quarter. Your focus on customers and operational excellence has provided record quarterly results for our shareholders, and I remain extremely optimistic about HEICO's future. I also want to thank everyone on the call, the HEICO team members and our customers and vendors who themselves or family members have served this great country. Some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. I hope you had these patriots in your port on Memorial Day. HEICO is proud of the role we play in support of the armed forces of the United States and our allies. I will summarize the highlights of the second quarter fiscal '24 results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the second quarter of fiscal '24 represent record results for HEICO an improved by 33% and 39%, respectively, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. The results mainly reflect 21% organic net sales growth in the Flight Support aftermarket replacement parts and the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as improved results at ETG. Consolidated net income increased 17% to a record $123.1 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $105.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated EBITDA increased 35% to $252.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $187.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Our consolidated EBITDA margin was a very healthy 26.4% in the second quarter of fiscal '24. The Flight Support Group set all-time quarterly net sales and operating income records in the second quarter of fiscal '24, improving an enormous of 65% and 49%, respectively, over the second quarter of fiscal '23. The increase principally reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and strong 12% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand for Flight Support Group, aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts services. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.45x as of April 30, '24 and that was down from 3.04x as of October 31, '23. We remain on track to lower our leverage to 2x within 12 to 18 months post the Wencor acquisition. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 82% to $141.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $77.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. At this time, I would like to introduce Eric Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and the President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, and he will discuss the second quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Thank you, Victor. Now for the outlook. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both FSG and ETG, principally driven by contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as demand for the majority of our products. Notably, we remain optimistic on the ETG's opportunity to expand and grow its net sales of defense-related products over the next six months of fiscal '24 and that is supported by a strong backlog. Additionally, we plan to continue our commitment to developing new products and services, and further market penetration while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. In closing, I would like to thank our dedicated and loyal team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Our dedication to customers, team members and the production of high-quality, highly engineered niche products continues to be a winning strategy in the marketplace. The end markets we serve remain very healthy, and I'm highly optimistic about HEICO'S future. Thanks for all you do to make HEICO a great company. And now, I would like to open the floor for questions. So, this is Larry Mendelson. I want to thank everybody on this call for their interest in HEICO. We look forward to speaking with you when we report third quarter results and that will be some time about three months from now. So meanwhile, have a very good summer, enjoy summer, be safe. And HEICO will, I believe, do extremely well. Thank you, and that's the end of this call."

The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 65% to a record $647.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $392.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase reflects the impact from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions and strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects 21% organic growth within our aftermarket replacement parts product line. Both the legacy hikes in Wencor operations continue to exceed our expectations, and the results prove that Wencor was an excellent investment for HEICO. Both HEICO's and Wencor's entrepreneurial culture and a record of producing high-quality products continues to produce wins in the marketplace. Our customers continue to find great value in our larger aftermarket product offerings for their aerospace parts and component repair and overhaul needs. Consistent with HEICO's time-tested and well-known operating philosophy, we continue to operate Wencor as a stand-alone business operation. However, we have made good progress working together and serving our customers. Some examples of how we are now working together include the utilization of all HEICO and Wencor PMAs and DERs at all repair stations, commercial and defense aftermarket sales cooperation where appropriate, Wencor e-commerce platform lists all HEICO noncompetitive PMAs. Wencor is utilizing HEICO's manufacturing base to quote new products, Engineering and regulatory cooperation that we expect to yield tremendous benefits for our company and sharing best-in-class vendors. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 49% to a record $148.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '24, up from $99.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth. Partially offset by higher as expected intangible asset amortization expense due to the Wencor acquisition. The prior year impact from the amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement and increased inventory obsolescence expense. The price of Work Group's operating margin was 23% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 25.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Given that acquisition-related intangibles amortization in the second quarter of 2024, consumed around 280 basis points of our operating margin. The FSG cash margin before that amortization, otherwise known as EBITDA, was around 25.8%, which is excellent in absolute terms, and we are extremely pleased with it. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the prior year impact from the previously mentioned amendment and termination of a contingent consideration agreement and the previously mentioned higher intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense as a percentage of net sales. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the second quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. Rob, this is Eric. So, as you know, we operate a very decentralized business. And in order to drive -- to capture those numbers from all of the business units, it would be very difficult that we don't capture that. So, I don't know the specific finite answer to that. But I can tell you that we've gotten a little bit of pricing. As I've mentioned on prior calls that our customers are very comfortable with our need to test on our increases in the cost to manufacture and our cost to do business. And so, in order to maintain our margins, our prices have to go up by at least that amount. So, they understand that, and we've been able to do that. So, there has been a certain amount in terms of price increase -- cost increases driving price increases. And then as far as the balance, I don't have the, as I said, the specific numbers in front of me, but my guess is that it's probably I don't know, half and half, half existing product increased penetration and half the sale of new products that hadn't been sold in the year ago period. That would be might get -- some of the businesses do capture this. So, I am able to see it for certain companies. And that's why I'm able to say what I just said but that's sort of my feeling on it. But we are not a price increase story. So, it's -- we're not driving these 21% return, a 21% increase is because we're raising price 21%. My guess is that price would be far less than 1/3, maybe even less than -- even less than 1/4 of that number. So, most of it would be volume increases. So, Rob, that's a great question. And as you know, we're very sensitive about giving specific information due to competitive reasons, as you can imagine, on any particular platform. But I can tell you that we have our eyes on new platform opportunities. Yes, we're willing to develop some product based on speculation that we'll be able to sell it. But we really need to make sure that the customers will be there and commit to us. You pointed out in your question, the basis and the reason why we exist and why our customers want us to exist. And I agree with you. I think that if there were alternative sources of supply, the situation wouldn't be as dire as it is. But at the moment, I'm going to have to pass on really where we are at that point. But needless to say, we've got people focused on all parts of the market. Got it. So, the answer is we don't specifically capture what those numbers are. It's very hard to capture. And what we're just trying to do is get the businesses to do what's in their interest and to do what's in their customers' interest and the combined HEICO interest. So unfortunately, I don't have a number, but I can tell you that just breaking down, looking at the various areas, the use of the Wencor PMAs, Wencor and HEICO PMAs and DERs at the repair station is very significant. We always said that the product selections from both companies were was extremely complementary. There was not a lot of overlap. So, you can just imagine when overhauling an LRU by being able to purchase each other's PMAs, which, to a certain extent, was done pre-acquisition but by being able to use each other's DERs and being able to rationalize where we overhaul these products. We've got multiple repair stations that are obviously strong in certain areas and weaker in other areas, and they've been able to buy themselves and without me orchestrating this they've been able to share technology and figure out where it makes sense to swap product line, swap technologies. And as a result, it's really hard to measure this stuff. So, we really don't even try. As far as the aftermarket sales cooperation, I'd say that's been excellent in terms of opening doors for each other. We've had meetings with airlines who are so excited that we have the potential of putting all of these increased number of products together and really provide a very, very unique service. And I can tell you, the airline support has been extraordinary. We thought that it would be good but it is really off the charts outstanding. In terms of the defense aftermarket, we've already -- that there are all sorts of examples where in the international market, we were procuring parts from other sources. Now, we're buying the legacy HEICO companies are buying it from the Wencor companies and vice versa. So that's working extremely well. Having the -- we are able to see when we list the HEICO parts on the Wencor platform, we are able to see what that is, and that's been excellent and very good. In terms of manufacturing new products down the road, Wencor has a very aggressive new product development program and having all of the 10 HEICO manufacturing businesses open to manufacture products makes a lot of sense, and I think it's really going to benefit future of course, that hasn't benefited yet. It benefited the numbers. In terms of engineering and regulatory cooperation, that's substantial by pooling the talents of both businesses we're able to get a lot more done. And I can tell you in discussions also with the FAA, they're very excited about that as well. And then obviously, sharing best-in-class vendors. So, I'm sorry that I can't give you a specific number, but I think you see it in our organic growth and in our margin expansion, which is frankly beyond where I thought we would be. And I'm just so happy with the results that I'm letting them speak for themselves. No, yes. I understand your question, and I can tell you that how the prices that we sell as a percentage of OEM, I would say, are unfortunately at an all-time low. So, the OEMs have raised prices faster than we have raised prices. We want to make sure that, as I said, we need to pass on -- nobody wants a price increase. And while it appears easy, I must say that I understand, I know what it feels to walk in our sales to choose trying to get these price increases because even though costs are going up, nobody wants to take a price increase, especially when you when you're delivering so much value. So, while we have been successful in recapturing our increased costs and plus a little bit in some cases, at the percentage of OEM at which we sell our parts is, as I said, at an all-time low. And we're in the market capture space, and we think that we can continue to drive exceptional value for our customers by maintaining this philosophy. And Scott, this is Eric. Scott, this is Eric. And I can tell you, this is a shout-out to our many team members who I think are on this call. But HEICO has got the biggest bunch of sandbaggers that you've ever -- that I've ever seen. And one, they're super talented. This is not meant to take away from their achievements because their achievements are nothing short of incredible and amazing. However, having said that, as Carlos said, they tend to be very conservative. We joke around internally. Carlos and I call them sandbaggers. They know who they are. I understand that we're just taking these numbers and rolling them up and when we go and talk to them about common, you're performing at this, why is the number going to go down? They've got 22 possible reasons, including a meteor strike and all sorts of crazy stuff that could cause it. And as a result, we really take up the numbers and we even had a positive contingency very often to it because we know that they're low. But it is very -- it's very hard to quantify. And the reason I don't if you will, fight the sandbagging is because it encourages them to look at all of the areas of potential risk. There are all sorts of -- there's -- it's a Herculean effort to achieve these numbers. And there are all sorts of things that can go wrong in the supply chain and with technology and processes, all sorts of things. And they are very much focused on what can go wrong. And as a result, since they work so hard to mitigate those factors, they most of the time, almost always overperform. So that's sort of where we are in it. I mean we're hoping to do better. But based on the numbers that we've gotten, variations in the business cycle, this is what it rolls up to. So, we just sort of go with that. Got it. So, the short answer to that is in fiscal '25, we think is when it's going to happen. I do want to mention that actually, we don't make -- HEICO doesn't make any munitions I think what you're referring to is missile defense. So, we are very active on missile defense interceptors, and we have a high content there on other missile platforms. But typically, it's more in the defense area, although I suppose there is some in the offensive. But we don't make the explosives themselves. When you look at the numbers, we're anticipating next year is going to be very strong. We've had significant ramp-ups in a number of businesses. And we have significant orders on the books. And now we've just got to produce. Record backlog. We're really very, very good in the Specialty Products area. So I'm anticipating very good results in 2025 on that. Yes. I think there are some market share gains there. Larry, this is Eric. There are market share gains. I think that in the parts area. Remember, our business -- we typically ship discrete parts. So, if we've got the part on the shelf, we're able to sell it, whereas in the component repair business, we're really beholden to the supply chain. We can have an LRU that's got a few hundred different part numbers in the bill of material and one part is being held up, which actually is the case in many different businesses, and we can't ship it. And we've got this big backlog, and it's basically just sitting there. And so that's sort of, I think, what's also going on there. Larry, so that's a great question. A lot of people have wondered about that. And as you know, HEICO has the unique ability, which you don't typically find in a company of our size to operate businesses in the similar same spaces and to sort of direct traffic so they don't hurt each other and make sure that we maintain the entrepreneurial spirit. And I think that is the single most important thing that we can do. Just last week, I was at the Aerospace Industries Association Board of Governors meeting. And actually, PwC did a wonderful presentation speaking about what's going on in terms of the employment trends in the aerospace market. And what was interesting is that the lack of interest from people with regard to aerospace is not due to the mission of aerospace or even the defense part because some people are sensitive about that. And it's not due to the earnings level. It's due to the fact that when people join large companies, they feel pigeonhole and they don't feel like they have -- they're able to get a good experience. And I think that, that's the unique thing about HEICO. We recognize that there's no question there's synergy. If we can functionally put things together, we can drive certain processes, eliminate costs and do all that. But what it does in the process is it kills the entrepreneurial nature, the enthusiasm, the desire to stay up late, to work late to make sure that you accomplish what your customer needs where you have full responsibility for the product from selecting it, designing it, manufacturing it, procuring and inspecting it, selling it, accounting for it. And this is what is very, very motivational to our team. So, to answer your question, no, there's no plan to put this together. However, there is the opportunity to cooperate. And frankly, with the organic growth that we've got, if we could just have these businesses work together and become more efficient but still retain their entrepreneurial spirit and their individual focus. There are tremendous cost benefits by just giving our internal people the internal promotional opportunities and not having to go outside and hire more people. So, I don't see, if you will, cost synergies in terms of job reductions. But I do see the opportunity for our people to put their heads together and figure out -- we've already gotten to the point where one plus one equals two-and-half, but I think we're going to continue to focus to plus one plus one can equal three or four or five. And that's really the focus. And it's not going to be through job cuts, the way some other companies handle this kind of thing. We think it's pretty substantial. Wencor has an excellent vendor base and they remain loyal to that vendor base. They're not, in general, moving product from established vendors who are making it. However, as you know, the industry supply is very tight right now, even in the HEICO businesses. And we have the opportunity to redirect capacity, frankly, in our Specialty Products more towards the HEICO businesses. And I've been out there working with the Head of our Specialty Products Group and I are working with our individual businesses to explain the virtue of manufacturing for HEICO and Wencor as opposed to only third-party customers because when third-party customers, they're great, and we want to stay focused on them as well. But when it's an internal customer, you know very clearly what's going on competitively and we're able to move priorities for them. So and also able to really focus on the quality. I mean, that's been a key focus for HEICO and for Wencor in terms of making sure that the products that we supply are the absolute best in the industry. So, I think this is something that will start to pay dividends in 2025 and after, both in terms of more timely deliveries, our internal customers as well as, frankly, a profit margin that our specialty products companies can make by supplying these high-quality parts to the HEICO companies. There's a lot of stuff that we can do. There are 10 different businesses in our specialty products group, and they all have unique capability. And we -- I think there is opportunity in the vast majority of them. It's -- so I spoke with all of our sales heads last week and on overall the details, and we're seeing tremendous strength around the world. The Americas remains strong as well as Europe and Asia, Middle East, China. So, we're seeing very good strength across the board. The market seems extremely strong. People want to travel, both for business as well as leisure, so things look good. I wouldn't say there's one or two areas of particular strength. I'd say it's very broad-based. And ETG is probably higher than that for a variety of reasons because we have some businesses, ETG is probably above 5% on R&D. So, Bert, that's something that we think about all the time. However, in order to be in this industry, you've got to really have a long-term view. And we never know what's going to come around the corner, but we've got to be well positioned for everything. So, we're fundamental believers in commercial and military aviation. We think that these are really good spaces to be in. We understand them extraordinarily well. We're really appreciated by our customers. Yes, there is tremendous strength, yes, there is a certain percentage of the fleet that's down as a result of issues that are going on, but we also have a fleet -- a massive fleet of 20,000 something to aircraft that's aging one year per year. And most of the other major players out there increased price very substantially. So, we think that we're in a very good area, could there be a little air pocket here or there, sure, that could absolutely happen, but that's why we don't like to be over-levered. And we want to make sure that we've got plenty of cash to always do the right thing to continue our successful acquisition program, which is key to everything we do. And we're going to be very strong no matter what happens out there. So and then also to point out the obvious, I mean, every roughly nine years, 10 years or so, there's always some black swan event. The last one, of course, is the most dramatic but look at how strong we've emerged from it. And when we look at our sales as a percentage of what we were doing in 2019, I mean, this company has absolutely transformed for the better and grown tremendously, both organically and via acquisition since then. So, we don't worry about, if you will, the little air pockets or what could be happening down the road. I mean I could paint a scenario where, I mean, look, we hope that the new manufacturer gets strengthened out because we have -- we can benefit very well as a result of that. And we hope the world economy remains strong and people want to trap and all that capacity is soaked up, it becomes impossible for any anybody to calculate. So, we just keep our heads down and focus on the business, and I'm very confident we're going to do well. I don't have that information in front of me. But our -- I'm getting it's in when you go across all of the businesses, I'm guessing it's in sort of the 50-50 area. But I don't have that specific information. As a result, as I mentioned earlier, as a result of the decentralized structure. We don't capture a lot of that information. But my guess is it's probably around the half and half area. Well, so my comment about the 50-50 is looking at our entire parts business, which includes both PMA and distribution. So, I think the distribution will probably due to less contracts, in other words, less than 50%, and the PMA would be more than 50%. So that's sort of the dichotomy there that I was looking at. Our customers with regard to PMA, they like the idea of having a long-term agreement, and we like that idea too because we can go out and procure the product for them and protect them. Clearly, if they want to be protected on price, we're happy to do that. But in turn, they've got to commit to us. So definitely, on the PMA side, the percentage of contracts would be -- I'm guessing well over 50%. I would say, overall, it was very broad-based. In the quarter, it's hard to sort of get into it by particular product type and that can be sort of heavily skewed depending on what inventory packages are taking place. So, at the moment, I think it would be misleading for me to get into that because people would extrapolate and view it perhaps not correctly. If you don't mind, I'd rather punt and talk about that perhaps next quarter as we start to see some of this. But as I mentioned earlier, it does appear to be very broad-based the support is really broad-based. We are fully 100% committed to M&A. It is a key part of HEICO's strategy, and it drives a nice chunk of our growth. We as you can see, we were over 3x levered after we completed the Wencor acquisition. And then we also purchased the Honeywell display unit product line. Now we're down to 2.45x. Our M&A teams are very, very focused in finding great companies. We're in discussions with many. We work really hard to be the acquirer of choice. I think that we are sort of lucky and fortunate in that our competitive advantage is this decentralized model, which appeals to people very well. I mean, I can tell you, when I visit companies, even in processes, I would say, at least four out of five leadership teams tell us that HEICO is their preferred acquirer. And of course, who knows what they tell all the different bidders out there. But I really do believe that our approach is unique and people want a part of it, and we are very, very much focused. And also, it's supported by our customers. I mean it was our customers who wanted and we were so excited about the Wencor acquisition because we could put these two product lines together and really offer much more of a competitive offering to our airline customers. I mean they were the ones most supportive of doing this. So ,we're going to remain very, very active in that area. I mean, we don't get into the specifics, but no. I mean, I wouldn't say that on Wencor sales were down. I mean Wencor quarter is performing extremely well. They're way up as compared to last year. So, they're performing well. I mean, look at any of the businesses, you've got this -- we're at the mercy of the supply chain. And I can tell you that we've got a lot of suppliers who are very, very late. And that can sway quarters significantly actually. But Wencor is performing extraordinarily well, winning new business, we couldn't be happier. Yes. So, Gautam, I think what you're referring to is we said that historically, Wencor originally got its it sort of focus was more in the repair stations. They still dealt with the airlines, but more of their focus originally was in the repair stations, and it was sort of vice versa with HEICO. But I can tell you that the cooperation is going extremely well. We are -- both companies are helping each other. And there are airline customers where Wencor had more of a presence in their airline customers where HEICO had more of a presence. And we are introducing the folks on both sides so they can go ahead and take advantage of those relationships in that history and be able to sell the products. So, I think that, that is happening as we speak. And I anticipate that that's going to continue to occur in 2025. I think we will continue to see the very good results in that area. No, no. We have received sales on it. And I think that's one of the reasons you see the organic growth rate, and you see the margins that we have because we've already realized the benefits. I think there's a lot more to come. And -- but we recognize them thus far. And of course, Gautam, this is Eric. We've got, as I mentioned, in the quarter, we had 280 basis points from intangible amortization. So, you add that and we're really approaching 25% on an EBITDA basis, which is outstanding. Yes. I would think it's closer to the 500 area. Wencor continues to focus and develop a very aggressive number of products. HEICO, obviously, the same. The key is getting all those parts manufactured and getting the airlines to buy them. So, we've got the capability, and we continue to we're not going to cut back in any of that area."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Laurans Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Samara and welcome to everybody on this call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to the HEICO first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson and Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another very, very strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operating at peak performance level continued to fuel our excellent financial results. I personally have never been more optimistic about the future of HEICO. I would now like to summarize the highlights of our first quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improved by 39% and 44%, respectively as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23. These results reflect mainly a 12% organic net sales growth in Flight Support, commercial aerospace products and services as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 23% to $114.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and '23 were both favorably impacted by a discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal '24, net of controlling interest, was $13.3 million and that was up from $6.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated EBITDA increased 43% to $224.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $157.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. I mean that is an enormous increase, if I say so myself. The Flight Support Group set an all-time quarterly net sales and operating income record in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improving 67% and 63% respectively, over the first quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor and 12% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.79x as of January 31, '24 and that was down from 3.0x as of August 31, '23. When we acquired Wencor, our pro forma leverage ratio was slightly above 3x. And we had projected pro forma leverage to be 2x within 12 to 18 months post-acquisition. At this time, I am pleased to report that we continue to remain on track to achieve this target. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 46% to $111.7 million in the first quarter fiscal '24 and that was up from $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '24. In January '24, we paid our regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share and this represented our 91st consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. In January '24, we were honored to announce that I received the Kenn Ricci Lifetime Aviation Entrepreneur Award from the Living Legends of the Aviation Organization. The Living Legends of Aviation recognition is given to remarkable people of extraordinary accomplishment in aviation, including entrepreneurs, innovators, industry leaders, astronauts, record breakers, pilots who become celebrities and celebrities who have become pilots. I was profoundly humbled and honored that this storied and a unique organization would include me with such aviation and space pioneers for this special honor. However, in my opinion, the honor really belongs to HEICO's 10,000-plus team members who are the ones that make HEICO the great company that it is. Now let me discuss our recent acquisition activity. In December '23, we entered into an exclusive license and acquired certain assets for the capability to support Boeing 737NG/777 cockpit display and legacy display products line from Honeywell International. We do expect the exclusive license and asset acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in the year following closing. The acquisition broadens our avionics capability and it's another example of ways that HEICO has grown into adjacent markets to increase our overall value proposition to customers and the industry. At this time, I would now like to introduce Eric Mendelson who is Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group. He will discuss the first quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?\nEric Mendelson: The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 67% to a record $618.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $371.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor which continues to perform above our expectations as well as strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects high teens organic net sales growth from both our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 63% to a record $136 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 principally reflects the pre-mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by higher, as expected, intangible asset amortization expenses due to the Wencor acquisition well as increased inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 22% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group's operating margin before intangible amortization expense was 24.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 versus 24.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The small decrease in operating margin principally reflects a slightly lower gross profit margin in the previously mentioned higher expected intangible asset amortization expense due to the Wencor acquisition partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the first quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group.\nVictor Mendelson: Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 -- excuse me, jumped ahead. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 12% to $285.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 up from $255.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisitions and a double-digit increase in organic net sales of our aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of our other electronics, medical and space products. We continue to forecast strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to $56.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We expect higher net sales and profit margins in the quarters ahead and over the long term. This is due to our shipment schedule supported by our near-record backlog, combined with the revenues we expect because of our new product research and development activities. The slight operating income decreased principally resulted from our subsidiary shipment schedules of our record backlogs with fewer shipment in the first quarter than scheduled in future quarters, something that was scheduled prior to the quarter start and is in line with our internal plan. For those familiar with our last earnings call and our public interaction since then, you will remember that we said to expect high results variability quarter to quarter this year with the first quarter being our weakest quarter. So this proceeded just as expected. Naturally the less favorable product sales mix resulted in lower SG&A efficiencies also recognizing our large record backlogs and our forward growth potential, we increased new product research and development investment which increased expenses in the quarter so that we can gain revenue in future quarters. As I sit here today, I'm very pleased that we made those investments and that we continue to fully fund these activities which provide the important forward growth. Importantly our net sales increased an acquisition cost in the first quarter of fiscal '23 related to the closing of an acquisition were beneficial to our results. The ETG's operating margin was 19.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. This acquisition related amortization was around 400 basis point what we and others to be -- consider to be our true margin was closer to 23.5%. Again we expect the margin, both before and after amortization to improve materially in the quarters ahead. The lower margin principally reflects what I just discussed namely the product sales mix due to the shipment schedule, higher new product research and development expenses as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales which supports our forecasted strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs. For the full year, we expect SG&A expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as our net sales increase. I now turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson.\nLaurans Mendelson: Thank you, Victor. I think it should be clear to everyone on this call that Victor and we are expecting a quite different result from ETG from the second quarter through the end of the year. And in the first quarter, some people, I think, misunderstood and they said, \"Oh, ETG is not doing well.\" And I think Victor explained it very well. So you understand that it is a lumpy business and the sales and earnings should come through from the second to the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support and ETG principally driven by contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as demand for the majority of our products. Notably, we fully expect future ETG quarters to be materially stronger than the first quarter. In addition, we plan to continue our commitment to developing new products and services with further market penetration as well as maintaining our financial strength and our flexibility. In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Our strategy of growing a highly diversified portfolio of excellent businesses continues to produce favorable results for all shareholders. Our end markets are very healthy and fiscal '24 is looking to be another great year. Thank you for your continued confidence. And as I said before, I have never been more bullish about HEICO's future. One other comment. We do not now give any guidance. Some analysts have asked us to give guidance. We prefer not to. However, I have said publicly that our goal is to grow net income 15% to 20% annually compounded. Over the last 30 to 33 years, I think, we have done that and the actual growth has been somewhere around 18% or 19%. I can tell you that based on everything that I know at this moment and based upon our -- what we expect for the future of this year. I clearly am highly confident that we will attain that 15% to 20% growth in the current year and that without any future acquisitions which we might make. So with that, I would like to turn the call back to our operator, Samara and open the call for questions from listeners. I thank you again very much. Samara?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nScott Mikus: This is Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. Eric, I wanted to ask you some of the U.S. airlines, they've readjusted their capacity growth plans for the year. Some of that's due to aircraft delivery delays or the GTF issues but some of it's -- just are concerns related to the U.S. domestic market being overcapacitized. So are you seeing any change in order patterns from customers where maybe the low-cost carriers are slowing down their orders but the large network carriers, like United and Delta are accelerating their orders?\nEric Mendelson: So thanks for your question, Scott. With regard to what we see in the market, the market continues to be extremely strong across the board. I think yes, the large commercial carriers are particularly strong. There has been a little bit of weakness in -- with some of the lower-cost carriers. But nothing really pronounced at this point. There are natural order patterns where things can get a little lumpy shift around. So I don't want to -- I wouldn't want to predict any weakness there. Right now, there continues to be a shortage of parts. Airlines are still in need of parts, are still trying to grow their inventory. So we see the market as very strong.\nScott Mikus: Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to ask, you've owned Wencor for about a little more than half a year. So I was just wondering if you could share some of the best practices that Wencor has learned from HEICO? And what are some of the best practices that HEICO has learned from Wencor so far?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, that's a good question. The Wencor acquisition has been exceeding expectations in every single area, the business, the people, the strategy, it's been incredibly strong. And we had very high expectations for it and they are even beating those numbers. Specifically, looking at areas of best practices. I would say that HEICO is particularly strong in the technical arena. Wencor is also strong in the technical arena. But I think there are some things where Wencor has been able to benefit from us as well as HEICO benefiting from Wencor and other areas. And then in particular, in the e-commerce area. I think Wencor has been able to benefit HEICO in that area. So we see continued synergies without integration. So we -- our plan is to continue to operate Wencor for the time being or for the foreseeable future as an independent business. And that's the DNA of HEICO. That's how we operate all of the HEICO businesses and we want Wencor to continue, obviously, to have its own P&L, its own strategy, its own team members and HEICO is strongest when each of the individual business units take care of themselves and coordinate with the other ones. So I would say that I look at the cooperation between HEICO and Wencor is somewhat analogous between the cooperation, if you look at a number of the European airline groups. We look at Lufthansa and Swiss or Air France and KLM or British Airways and Iberia and they maintain their independence, their separate touch and feel and relationships with the customers, separate people but they coordinate some of the activities behind the scenes, making sure that they're -- the schedules and the product offerings are supportive of each other. And that's what we've been able to do very successfully. So Wencor continues as an individual autonomous business, no plan to change that. And we are making sure that we provide tremendous value to our customers as a result of making sure we don't have, for example, product development overlap, where we rationalized some of the repair offerings in various centers of excellence focused on different products and technology. So our customers have been very happy as a result of the acquisition and are really excited about where we're headed there. And I think they really want to reward us with a significant additional new business. They view HEICO in a very different light as a result of the Wencor merger.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Last quarter, you had talked about the ETG margin for the full year being around 24%, that segment operating margin. Does that stand such that you'd have one or two quarters above that? And I know you don't give quarterly guidance but given the variability here, I don't know if it makes sense to just speak to the shape of that over the remaining three quarters of the year?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. Noah, this is Victor. The answer to your question is yes. And as to the shape of it over the remaining quarters, I think that the year should build. I'm not sure yet that the fourth quarter is a little far out, whether the fourth quarter finishes above or a little less than the third quarter and the third is our high point or fourth is our high point, not sure about that. But at this point and based on the shipment schedules, that's how we think it will play out.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And Eric, on the FSG margin, the full year look was around 21% on the GAAP segment operating margin. And I think you guys had also said you expected the first quarter to be the low point of the year. So I don't know, maybe you could update us on how you see that playing out through the rest of the year or if there's a new number for the full year, given what you did in the first quarter?\nEric Mendelson: Well, the first quarter was very strong at 22%. And when you add back the [indiscernible] amortization, we get to about 24.8%, so extremely strong. We anticipate continued strength. I think I want to be a little bit conservative going forward. We often go ahead and we come out with our budgets and our numbers and our folks end up beating those numbers. But maybe Carlos wants to shed some light specifically on that.\nCarlos Macau: Noah, it's Carlos. I don't think my view on the segment -- can you hear me okay? So I was going to say, I don't think my mind has changed on what the segment should produce this year. Back in December when we were sort of looking out and I got the margin question. I felt like the FSG was probably between 21% and 22% OI margin, that's what I felt the company would do for the year. We could always do better than that but that's what we planned. And so -- and we did plan on having a strong first quarter in the FSG. So I think that, that thesis continues to hold up. But of course, as we get into the second quarter and we get to the next call, we'll I'll see if I can tighten that range up for you.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. I appreciate that. One other thing I wanted to ask, I guess, it's kind of for everyone but you're in this unique position now vis-\u00e0-vis PMA and pricing in the aftermarket that's maybe more unique than we've seen in a long time because your peers in the -- that build and sell spare parts have had such strong pricing for 2-plus years now. We don't really know exactly how you price PMA, presumably, that gap has widened, maybe it has widened a lot. And so you have the opportunity to take more price than you normally do or take more share than you normally do or both. And I'm curious to hear you talk about how you will strategically manage which of those you want to go after and how you will look to triangulate that over the medium term here?\nEric Mendelson: Noah, that's a great and insightful question. The short answer is I think we need to do both. We need to adjust pricing to reflect our increased costs and we also need to grow market share. So that is the strategy. We have a number of customers who have been purchasing parts at fairly old prices before there was cost inflation. So we need to make sure that we pass along our cost increases. And I think our customers are very understanding of that. Some customers get it and are just fine and go ahead and incorporate the other -- the new pricing. Other customers want to have the discussion over it and we -- obviously, we don't show them what our costs are but we explain what's happened to our costs and this is only reasonable. So honestly, I think that our pricing has been a lot more conservative and gentle then it could be. Our competitors are substantially raising prices, we're seeing now last night from a -- I don't want to call out the OEM but it's an OEM that everybody knows and they increased price twice last year, once 10% and another time 18%. And by the way, I will mention it was not TransDigm. So I know people are very interested in the TransDigm story but it was not TransDigm. So it shows how pervasive the price increases are. So I think that we've been very mild. And I think, frankly, with costs going up and the need to spend additional dollars on new product development that it would be reasonable to have additional increases. And I think we'll be able to capture market share at the same time. So I don't think those two are mutually exclusive. We've -- if you talk to the airlines, I mean nobody wants the price increase, as you say. But the airlines all recognize that HEICO has been extremely gentle with regards to price increase. And frankly, in areas where we have been more restrictive on price increase, we anticipate significant share gains as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\nScott Deuschle: Eric, did Boeing's challenges in January have any impact to FSG Specialty Products growth in the quarter?\nEric Mendelson: Yes. I would say they did. Boeing had some challenges and as a result, the new bill has been impaired. So that definitely had an impact on specialty products. I would also like to point out that while specialty product sales were a little soft and caused the reported organic growth rate to be, if you will, understated because the aftermarket growth rate was very high teens. A lot of the -- we're very bullish on the future. And a lot of what specialty products does is on the defense side. And as you know, in a lot of missile defense and space programs, rocket motor programs, these are very long lead time items. So our order book is extremely strong. We're very, very bullish on the future. We feel that we're well embedded. We've got some great secular trends we are the low-cost, high-quality, sole-source producer on most of the stuff and we think that the future will be very good. So I'm not at all concerned about the specialty products being down. And I think Boeing also will get their act together. I mean, obviously, they've got some challenges that we've all read about but Boeing is still a great company. And I think that they'll get that all figured out and it will permit our specialty products to grow at sort of more historic rates.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. So it would be fair to think that maybe some of that Boeing related weakness is probably lingered in the February but the growth in the space and defense side allows you to return to growth overall in specialty products next quarter?\nEric Mendelson: I need to look at specifically with regard to next quarter but what you're saying sounds logical.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. And then Victor, are you able to quantify how much R&D was up at ETG in the quarter? And then if there's any specific areas of investment you can talk about, I think that would be pretty interesting to hear.\nVictor Mendelson: It was pretty broad-based. There were places I think where somewhere I know that we invested more than in the past. But I would say pretty broad-based scenario which is good because I like to see -- and we like to see that all of our companies are investing in R&D. R&D was up by about I believe in the quarter about 25%, 24%, something like that. So it was a significant increase for us.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. And then last question. Victor, were there any changes in your F-35 content with the shift to TR3 [ph]?\nVictor Mendelson: By the way, it's closer to 22%, I think, was the net increase for ETG alone in the quarter. Yes, that for ETG [ph] in the quarter. I'm sorry, the question you just asked. Could you repeat that, please?\nScott Deuschle: Yes. It was whether there are any changes in F-35 content with the shift to TR3 [ph]?\nVictor Mendelson: I don't think it's material to us. We do have in a fuel business as F-35 content. But overall, it's not a material change.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities.\nLarry Solow: Eric, thanks for the color on Wencor and also just the segment. Just a couple of follow-ups on that. So the high-teens growth, you're experiencing -- I think it's relative comping to a mid-20s growth last year. So pretty remarkable, congrats to that. Obviously, end market demand sounds like it's still growing. But can you give us a little more color on where else those gains are coming from? Just kind of bucketing market share gains? Are there obviously some of that's still occurring. The inventory levels, you mentioned still low but are they building back up if some of that still creating some of the differences in to end market demand and the growth you're reporting, you catch up the maintenance maybe? I'm just trying to figure out the -- trying to gap the difference there.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. Larry, I'd be happy to answer that. The strength within site support on the aftermarket side has really been across the board. I would say, in general, a little more strength in the parts side as compared to the repair side. Airlines are finding the equipment hard. It's more difficult to get things repaired but in general, I would say the parts side is a little bit stronger but the repair side is also doing very well as well. As far as market share gains, we continue to grow market share. Our customers are really happy with us. And speaking with our sales head yesterday, I have specific information from a number of customers that they really are very, very happy as a result of the Wencor acquisition. While HEICO was always a significant player in the space. And so it was Wencor, the fact that we've come together and we can offer a broader product line, a broader suite of products is really significant. And a fair amount of energy was spent in each business focusing on capturing as much as it could. And now by creating more of these centers of excellence, where each business focus is on where it has a true competitive advantage it doesn't need to, if you will, reinvent the wheel, makes a lot of sense. And our customers are really happy about that because we're able to provide a much fuller suite of offering to the customers and they recognize that this is true structural advantage that they can benefit from as opposed to more niche-oriented strategy. So market share gains, we have had some pricing gains. I don't have a breakout between the two. But I wouldn't say that market share is definitely the leading number there.\nLarry Solow: Got it. And I appreciate that. And then just switching gears to question, Victor. Just on the quarter and the outlook, it sounds like aerospace had some good follow-through and it was a little slow last year, at least on deliveries but that just sounds like that's continuing to return to growth mode. Just in terms of the other categories, I know it sounds like you mentioned a few there was just slower due time in electronic medical consumer space and those sound like they're all higher margin categories. I think on the last call, you guys had mentioned that there would be some of those, I think maybe the electronics piece would be slower. Is that still the case? Has anything changed in terms of your sort of full year outlook for ETG in terms of revenue composition and growth?\nVictor Mendelson: So overall, all in for the year right now, I think our expectations are pretty much what they were at the -- during our last call. It is the general markets that all-in gave up ground in the quarter as we expected they would. We're beginning to see some, what I'd call, the proverbial green shoots in a few of the businesses but we're still not running at order levels higher than prior year. And I -- as I kind of talked about before, I expect that sometime over the next couple of quarters, orders to start to reverse overall. And then -- one second. Thank you. [Indiscernible] off here in the room. And then I would expect that if you factor in lead times onto the backlog -- on to the orders and so on, as we get later in the year, that starts to turn overall in the right direction in terms of revenue.\nLarry Solow: Got you. Okay. Great. And then just lastly, Carlos, I think the tax rate, a little lower this quarter. I know you usually get those stock comp benefit in Q1. And any change to the full year outlook?\nCarlos Macau: No. I think for the full year, I continue to think we'll run between 20% and 21%, Larry. I think the effective tax rate we have in the first quarter here is about what I expected. I thought we'd catch about half our effective rate for the year this quarter and then we make it up more normalized rate in Qs 2, 3 and 4 but no real surprises. It played out the way I thought it would slightly better than last year's benefit but still in line with history and what we've seen in the past.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Victor, maybe just a quick one on if you're still seeing lingering impacts from the supply chain and that's also a factor that's kind of impacting you on the top line.\nVictor Mendelson: Thanks for asking. It's a good question. We're not seeing much of it. It has really improved, whether it's exactly back to normal. I'm not sure because I'm not sure what the new normal will be, in fact but I wouldn't -- I would say that at this point, supply chain is almost back to where it was. And the -- the labor market is -- has been challenging for a while and continues to be. And so I would say that impacts us as much, if not more, probably these days than the supply chain, just getting good, qualified people into the businesses.\nPeter Arment: And maybe if you could just update us on how your [indiscernible] is doing after owning the business now for, I guess, almost a year, right?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, we're very happy we own it. It's doing essentially as we expected and a lot of good potential ahead. Also, they're looking at a number of acquisitions we've been able to bring to them, they bring up some. We'll see whether they transpire. But a lot of good things happening there and so far, so good.\nPeter Arment: Great. And a quick one for Carlos. Carlos, just rough expectations on how you're thinking about interest expense for the year. I know the goal is obviously to continue to delever.\nCarlos Macau: Yes. I mean -- so right now, if everything plays out, I'm expecting our interest expense quarterly to run $35 million to $37 million. That's pretty much what -- we booked this quarter about $38 million. So I think as we pay some debt down, if we catch a break on a few rate cuts, you never know. I have a sort of tailing off a little bit at -- that also is a function, Peter of how quickly I can pay the debt down depending on how many businesses Eric, Victor and Larry want to buy will certainly influence that during the year.\nPeter Arment: Got it. I appreciate all the details and Larry, congrats on the award.\nVictor Mendelson: I just might add something to -- this is Victor, what Carlos had to say. We continue to look at acquisitions. Most are in our historical -- overwhelmingly in our historical size. And we have an excellent acquisition pipeline, very strong. Again, whether we do that remains to be seen. But we will continue to those acquisitions that would fit the right way while being mindful of the importance of reducing debt and capital structure.\nLaurans Mendelson: Just to further expand on what Victor said, it's completely correct. It's a balancing act. We are in the business of expanding, creating cash flow and bottom line income. And if we see an outstanding acquisition, we will make it. At the same time, we have to watch our debt level and we're trying to reduce it. So as you saw, we made a Honeywell acquisition recently because we believe it will be very accretive and very positive cash flow. So we made the decision to acquire it by using debt which reduced our ability to reduce our debt to overall debt. But on the bottom line, it was helpful to HEICO and actually where you get more income and debt. So the balance actually benefits the ratio of debt to EBITDA. But anyway, this is all a balancing act and we watch it very, very carefully because, as you know, we are focused on bottom line cash flow. So we will make these acquisitions when they are very, very desirable and we might have to use some debt but we'll take each one as it comes. We are here to grow HEICO bottom line cash flow. Again, it's a balancing act and we're very careful with it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Victor, I'm going to start with you if it's okay, given the ETG margins spotlight. You gave us some color on R&D up 20%, so it implies about 100 basis points of margin pressure. Can you maybe talk about the less favorable sales mix, how much it was maybe even pricing into the mix as well just on the bridge and how we think about that improvement, as you said, Q3 and Q4 are headed to be better and should we expect a similar sub-20% rate in Q2?\nVictor Mendelson: Sure. Sheila, a couple of things. One, I would be surprised to see a sub-20% rate in Q2. Number two, the sales difference was not based on pricing, it was based on the shipment schedule. So we -- I would call it a fairly normal pricing environment which means in some instances, the customers can accept the prices that recognize our cost that maybe higher and other instances we have longer term contracts where pricing is a lot thin. So it's kind of a normal scenario on the pricing side. Really, on the revenue side, it was all about the shipment schedule and when things were supposed to ship. It's not necessarily, by the way, the production rate. So we try to keep the facilities level loaded. Our businesses try to stay level loaded in production. But it depends upon when the order is due for delivery or acceptance and test by the customer, that dictates a lot of how it works for us. So again, just to emphasize, I would expect north of 20% GAAP margin -- operating margin on the quarter which, of course, would be north of 24% the true margin, excluding intangibles amortization.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. Any sort of color on the mix impact in the quarter in terms of margin headwind?\nVictor Mendelson: Not really other than the shipment schedules in our higher-margin businesses were lower than they had been in the prior period and that brings down the margin. But I don't want to break out which business is what margins but I think our business...\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Well, hopefully not. Eric, one for you if it's okay. Wencor, how do we think about this revenue synergy is the best? Is the best way to look at it based on a number of PMA parts? And the sales per part is about 4x greater at HEICO than it is at Wencor. So if you have that marketing channel, is that a potential way to think about the sales opportunity? Or how are you thinking about it?\nEric Mendelson: That is -- that's one way to think about it. I'm also really looking at it as how the product sets are very complementary, number one. Number two, without getting into specific customers, I would say there are a number of extremely strong relationships, sales relationships on the Wencor side as well as the HEICO side. And I think that we can help each other. The businesses can help each other with sharing those relationships and just basically one hand, helping the other. If you look historically, we've taken up our margins over the last decade that you covered us quite significantly and frankly, an even beat where I thought they would be. And I think that there is more potential in that regard. There's some -- there's a lot of sharing that also can occur over on the repair side in terms of DER repairs as well as they're already using the PMA parts. So I think that, that's an advantage. In the defense side, we're already cooperating and working together, whereas orders used to go out to third-party companies that are now being placed internally and that's very strong likewise over in our specialty manufacturing. There's a lot of product that our specialty manufacturing group can build for our other businesses including Wencor and we're really pushing that as well. So I think it's just a very broad-based level of cooperation, as I said, without integration. When you've got really talented people who are running these businesses, who have really mastered their businesses, we find that by getting them autonomy, that's very intrinsically motivating feature. And that's not something that exists in many companies. If you look at HEICO overall across all of HEICO, we've got roughly 100 business heads and for a company of our size to have 100 people of this talent and skill set where they performed so well and they really enjoy what they do because of way that they're treated, I think that's the real synergy here. It's not going to be from knocking out little costs here and there. I mean, yes, there's an opportunity to do that. And for example, in trade shows, in a number of the trade shows, Paris, Farmborough and others will have booths together. So HEICO and Wencor will be together. There'll be certain other trade shows where they can be separate. And we want the businesses to each have their own strategy and to really take responsibility for the results. So I think that's why we're getting these benefits.\nOperator: I'll take our next question from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America.\nMariana Perez Mora: So first of all, congratulations, Larry, on the award. My first question is about R&D, follow-up on ETG R&D. What are the main trends? Because you said like it's pretty much across the board increase. But what are the main trends that are driving this increase in R&D? What are the opportunities that you guys are seeing that actually are calling for this increase R&D? Is this the particular technology, is it the trend, is it the -- I don't know, an end market? Could you please discuss that.\nVictor Mendelson: Sure, this is Victor. It is a very good question. And by the way, when I say across the board, it doesn't mean in every business but it's kind of -- I should clarify what I mean by that is the majority of the business or sort of the super majority of the businesses. It is what I could call, the trend; there is a tremendous amount of opportunity for our businesses or newer and evolved products. Sometimes it's not just what you would consider revolutionary change, right? It's not necessarily developing something that is wholly new. In our case, it is more typically evolutionary and it is an improvement on an earlier version or iteration of a product. And so what we're seeing in a high number of our customers is demand for what you would consider our next generation of products. So it's not just technology based. It's not for example as though there is a new design that has been developed. Like Bluetooth came up many years and everybody was implementing Bluetooth. It's not like that. It's more responsive to the individual needs of our customers.\nMariana Perez Mora: And are usually customers calling for this improvement? How this like R&D, how you pay, what arenas, what specific products are still are on the option?\nVictor Mendelson: So we leave it to each one of our businesses to make those choices. In some cases, it's customer-initiated. In other cases, it's initiated by our subsidiaries or somewhere in between. I mean our businesses had regular meetings and visits and calls with customers. And so they're aware of new programs, the customer may be on. New designs that they might need. And that's probably the most typical but it runs the gamut, depending on the architecture of the particular business as well as the products. But the key to it is, one, a willingness to always invest and respond to the customer needs depending upon the history and relationship with the customer, the likelihood that they will, in fact, turn into orders. I mean let's be honest, there are companies who will always ask their suppliers, their vendors, partners to develop something on their dime. And then they may not buy it. So that is a factor that we consider is what is the history with the customer? Are they likely to, in fact, convert to orders? Is there a PO standing behind it? Are they on a program of record, for example, if it's defense and where do they stand with that program? What Intel are we getting in the broader community? What do we hear from our other partners, customers, even trade shows, government people, things like that. So each business, though, is responsible for that. And that, to be honest, the beauty, I think, of our company is that it's not from on high, it is experts talking with experts. We believe in devolving those decisions down at the lowest level to be able to understand the customer best.\nMariana Perez Mora: And my last one is on M&A. Could you please discuss when you do acquisitions like the recent Honeywell licenses [indiscernible], they are adjacent opportunities for you. But I could imagine that a company like this or a license could be able to unlock more upside opportunity in terms of revenues under the HEICO ecosystem compared to if this license ends up in another third-party MRO shop. Like can you please discuss how you think about those outside opportunities and how long it could take to actually see them?\nEric Mendelson: Sure. Mariana, this is Eric. I'd be happy to answer about that. So HEICO has done a number of licensing deals over the last decade. So we're very well experienced on doing those licensing deals. And in particular, when you look at the component repair footprint, HEICO has got 19 individual MRO businesses just within Flight Support. And then over in ETG, there are another number of them there as well. So we've been able to buy these licenses and basically take the technology and put it into a business that's already incredibly experienced in that market niche and really understands the technology. So when we buy a license, we're able then to go out to the customer with people who can hit the ground running in many cases, are already working with the customer on other items and it's really a seamless experience. So I think that there is plenty of opportunity for HEICO in this area to continue to grow in adjacent white spaces. I can tell you that our reception at the customers for the Honeywell product has been extremely strong. They've been very happy about that. They're used to our experience with regard to quality, turn time and price. So the reception has been very strong. So I think that it was a great move for both Honeywell as well as for HEICO as well as for our customers. There's just a net benefit increase to the industry here. So I think that there is additional opportunity for us.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Congrats on the award. A lot of questions have been asked and answered. I was wondering if you guys are seeing any difference in activity level in the direct channel versus the indirect and maybe you could just talk by market, whether it be aftermarket, whether it be OE, if you're seeing anything discernibly different -- restocking, destocking in the distributor channel and the like.\nEric Mendelson: Yes. We're -- Gautam, this is Eric. So you want to know how we're doing with regard to aftermarket and OE on order pattern or what you like me to comment on?\nGautam Khanna: Maybe just distributors, defense and aero, like is there -- are you seeing any differences in those order patterns versus selling direct outside of the distribution channel.\nEric Mendelson: Well, so our distribution businesses are doing extremely well. They're continuing to gain market share. They have the right inventories. I think our customers are very happy as a result of working with them. Likewise over in the PMA area where we -- and the repair area where we sell direct, it's likewise -- it's the same thing. So I would say a very good strength in both. With regard to product availability on the flight support side, things are tough where, frankly, our vendors are quite behind. And I think our results could be even better if they were able to shift the overdue backlog. And this is really across the board in the parts area. I would say both the PMA as well as the distribution. I think there have been some raw material challenges as a result of the sanctions. And then, of course, as Victor alluded to with regard to labor, that continues to be a challenge. But definitely, the supply chain is tight. There really isn't -- there's no excess capacity. Things are very tight. And we're hoping that by the end of '24, things normalize, Frankly, I would have thought by now things would have normalized more. But unfortunately, our vendors are -- they're really struggling. Things will get better after November in a lot of ways.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. And Carlos, you mentioned -- you talked about the 21% to 22% Flight Support margins is sort of the right ballpark and I think previously, you said the cycle would be somewhere in that range as well. I mean, is there any -- like what is the -- it sounds like Wencor is going better. There is some pricing opportunity, as you've mentioned in response to Noah's question, I'm just curious, like what is your confidence longer term of maybe doing better than that, forget fiscal '24 but just looking at...\nCarlos Macau: Highly confident. I mean I think if you look back over the last decade, just if you want to do a history lesson, go back from pre-COVID and just look back 10 years and you'll see a pattern of where the FSG continually ekes out 20, 30, 40 basis points a year. I mean, sometimes it's a little flatter. But if you look at that trend, I think we're returning to that. I think we -- that's on an annual basis, by the way. I think we're heading in that direction. We can't continue to grow at a breakneck pace. I think we're at a pretty high growth level right now. And at some point, we get back to what I'll call a normal business cycle and that's when you'll see our margin take those nice incremental jumps up. Until then, with our end markets being as hard as they are, the margin could fluctuate a little bit based on volumes, what we're selling. But I do think at some point when this hyper growth scenario we're in softens and gets back to, I don't want to say business as usual but a more customary demand in the market, I would say that, that incremental eke out of growth north, small increments is what we would expect to see. By the way, as far as the 21% to 22% I mean I feel very confident that we're going to wind up in there. We always could do better. But for modeling and thinking about the business, that's why I keep your focus in that area.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Maybe, Eric, first question for you. You talked about pricing being a primary growth driver when it comes to new customers just relative to existing customers where it's more a function of inflation pass-through. Can you just talk about what your new customer strategy is and maybe what percent of sales come from new customers in a given year? And just also, is this a new customer increasingly an internationally based customer?\nEric Mendelson: Yes, it's a good question, Bert. We don't have that many new customers and that's pretty much because we deal with everybody. So occasionally, when an airline gets formed, there can be a new one. I would say that our biggest opportunity is to continue to increase our market penetration with our existing customers. So that really is where the big opportunity is as opposed to new ones. I mean we do get new ones but we're pretty much dealing with everybody in the world. So like a new airline gets created, there wouldn't be that type of opportunity.\nBert Subin: And just a clarification there, Eric, just in terms of the pricing, if you're having sort of greater market share gains or market penetration, is that a different sort of function like if you're selling an existing product to an existing customer, you're pricing that, I guess, more gently in terms of just passing through inflation instead of maybe into market. But if you're selling them a new product, is that an opportunity when you think about margins?\nEric Mendelson: The answer is yes. So if a customer is buying a product and it's under contract, then obviously, they would have price protection for the terms of the contract, the duration of the contract if that's what it's provided for. And of course, there are different things which matter to different customers. So we're very accommodating there. However, if a customer -- if that customer wants to start buying a part that they haven't purchased, then they would get a price based on the new list price as opposed to what the old price was. So there's definitely a big incentive to get started and get locked in with us as early as possible.\nBert Subin: Okay. Got it. Super help, Larry. Just one follow-up. Were you reaffirmed your view towards 15% to 20% earnings growth that you sort of highlighted last quarter for FY '24, at least based on what you're seeing today. If we were to get to the end of the year and you were to outpace, I guess, on the positive side, the 20% mark, I'm just curious if you think that would be more a function of FSG, ETG or faster debt paydown?\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, it could be the result of all 3. And however, we try to control earnings growth. We really do. And HEICO, I think investors like consistency. I know we're probably the largest single investor in our company to get 401(k) and Carlos and -- so we like consistency. We don't like to go up 1 year, down the other. In order to do that and to generate cash flow, so we don't get over leverage. We'd like to continue to be within 15% to 20%. So it is possible we could go over 20%. At this point, everything I know in my -- our own thought projections, we will be within 15% to 20% -- would we go over it, it's possible. But at this moment, I wouldn't predict that. Again, I am conservative. And however, I do say that my own guesstimate is that we will be within 15% to 20%. So I don't know if that answers your question. But the other thing is I see that both of our businesses are really very strong. You've heard the whole story. And Victor has described the first quarter of ETG is really a weak quarter because we couldn't ship and these various things. The backlog supports a huge increase from the second to the fourth quarter. So we should see the ETG definitely level out and return to what I would call reasonably normal profitability. Flight Support similarly is very strong, too. And with the Wencor acquisition and the possibilities of gaining some of the synergies which we're doing very slowly and we want to build it in. But it's a long answer to your question but I really think at this point, we'll be within 15% to 20% growth. And if we go over, I can't predict who might do it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research.\nLouis Raffetto: Carlos, you talked about expecting, I guess, FSG to be pretty strong in 1Q. Was there anything specific there on mix? I'm just trying to bridge sort of the 100 basis point clean margin sequential improvement with sales that weren't sort of too dissimilar from last quarter?\nCarlos Macau: There was -- I would say that the -- we had strong performance in parts is kind of leading the pack. The repair was close second. Specialty products were soft and went behind. I think that based on shipments. That business is a little more predictable, believe it or not, than the parts and repair business are. So we had anticipated that the specialty products has slowed down slightly in Q1 and it did and we have expectations, it's going to be fine for the rest of the year. But I don't -- there is -- if your question is, is there any one-off or strange mix? No, this has pretty much played out the way I thought it would.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. Great. And then, Victor, just one for you. You laid out strong aerospace in the quarter and then some of those other markets. I didn't hear anything on defense. So I know it's a big part of the business, just making sure how that did in the quarter. You've seen -- I know you kind of have seen some sequential improvement. Does that continue this quarter? Did we step back at all?\nVictor Mendelson: Yes, Louis, it's continued overall all-in to grow. And so what I was segmenting out was the areas that were weak as before but defense is as we expect and moving in the right direction.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. Great. And then, Larry, just one for you. you kind of talked about balancing M&A and leverage. So I guess as we think about the rest of the year, is really -- would you be willing to go above 3x leverage if you saw a deal that would put you there? Or is that kind of a hard limit?\nLaurans Mendelson: The answer is if it was super sensational and it really added to the bottom line and we looked at it and the payback as a result of it would drop us below the 3x back into the 2x area, we might consider it. We're very careful with debt and also interest rates are very, very high. So to make these acquisitions now because of interest rates, it's a little bit harder. So to answer your question, it would have to be something sensational to make us go above 3x. And so far, I have not seen something so sensational. So I think it's highly unlikely but as we get from, say, just under 3x as we head to 2x which we estimate in the press release, we said 12 to 18 months from the time we incurred the debt and that's -- we believe that's accurate. But along the way, we might find, as we did with Honeywell, a very accretive cash flow and EPS acquisition which would actually make the ratio, if you do the arithmetic, you make the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA would go down because of the earnings that it would produce, we would do that. So again, that's why I say it takes a lot of thought process. We just don't make acquisitions willy-nilly. And remember one thing, that the Mendelsons as a family and our 401(k) we're there to protect that nest egg [ph]. And we're going to be very careful in incurring any kind of debt and we don't want to get into any kind of financial problem. We have great cash flow. We have a great business. It's growing nicely. So we'll be very careful with that debt. I don't know if that answers your question.\nOperator: And there are no additional questions.\nLaurans Mendelson: Well, I would like to again thank everyone on this call for their interest in HEICO. We are available; if you have other questions, you can contact Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself. And if you don't, we look forward to speaking to you on the second quarter earnings teleconference. That's the end of this teleconference. And again, thank you. Have a wonderful day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Macau",
            "content": "Noah, it's Carlos. I don't think my view on the segment -- can you hear me okay? So I was going to say, I don't think my mind has changed on what the segment should produce this year. Back in December when we were sort of looking out and I got the margin question. I felt like the FSG was probably between 21% and 22% OI margin, that's what I felt the company would do for the year. We could always do better than that but that's what we planned. And so -- and we did plan on having a strong first quarter in the FSG. So I think that, that thesis continues to hold up. But of course, as we get into the second quarter and we get to the next call, we'll I'll see if I can tighten that range up for you. No. I think for the full year, I continue to think we'll run between 20% and 21%, Larry. I think the effective tax rate we have in the first quarter here is about what I expected. I thought we'd catch about half our effective rate for the year this quarter and then we make it up more normalized rate in Qs 2, 3 and 4 but no real surprises. It played out the way I thought it would slightly better than last year's benefit but still in line with history and what we've seen in the past. Yes. I mean -- so right now, if everything plays out, I'm expecting our interest expense quarterly to run $35 million to $37 million. That's pretty much what -- we booked this quarter about $38 million. So I think as we pay some debt down, if we catch a break on a few rate cuts, you never know. I have a sort of tailing off a little bit at -- that also is a function, Peter of how quickly I can pay the debt down depending on how many businesses Eric, Victor and Larry want to buy will certainly influence that during the year. Highly confident. I mean I think if you look back over the last decade, just if you want to do a history lesson, go back from pre-COVID and just look back 10 years and you'll see a pattern of where the FSG continually ekes out 20, 30, 40 basis points a year.

            "name": "Victor Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 -- excuse me, jumped ahead. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 12% to $285.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 up from $255.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisitions and a double-digit increase in organic net sales of our aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of our other electronics, medical and space products. We continue to forecast strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to $56.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We expect higher net sales and profit margins in the quarters ahead and over the long term. This is due to our shipment schedule supported by our near-record backlog, combined with the revenues we expect because of our new product research and development activities. The slight operating income decreased principally resulted from our subsidiary shipment schedules of our record backlogs with fewer shipment in the first quarter than scheduled in future quarters, something that was scheduled prior to the quarter start and is in line with our internal plan. For those familiar with our last earnings call and our public interaction since then, you will remember that we said to expect high results variability quarter to quarter this year with the first quarter being our weakest quarter. So this proceeded just as expected. Naturally the less favorable product sales mix resulted in lower SG&A efficiencies also recognizing our large record backlogs and our forward growth potential, we increased new product research and development investment which increased expenses in the quarter so that we can gain revenue in future quarters. As I sit here today, I'm very pleased that we made those investments and that we continue to fully fund these activities which provide the important forward growth. Importantly our net sales increased an acquisition cost in the first quarter of fiscal '23 related to the closing of an acquisition were beneficial to our results. The ETG's operating margin was 19.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. This acquisition related amortization was around 400 basis point what we and others to be -- consider to be our true margin was closer to 23.5%. Again we expect the margin, both before and after amortization to improve materially in the quarters ahead. The lower margin principally reflects what I just discussed namely the product sales mix due to the shipment schedule, higher new product research and development expenses as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales which supports our forecasted strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs. For the full year, we expect SG&A expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as our net sales increase. I now turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson. Sure. Noah, this is Victor. The answer to your question is yes. And as to the shape of it over the remaining quarters, I think that the year should build. I'm not sure yet that the fourth quarter is a little far out, whether the fourth quarter finishes above or a little less than the third quarter and the third is our high point or fourth is our high point, not sure about that. But at this point and based on the shipment schedules, that's how we think it will play out. It was pretty broad-based. There were places I think where somewhere I know that we invested more than in the past. But I would say pretty broad-based scenario which is good because I like to see -- and we like to see that all of our companies are investing in R&D. R&D was up by about I believe in the quarter about 25%, 24%, something like that. So it was a significant increase for us. By the way, it's closer to 22%, I think, was the net increase for ETG alone in the quarter. Yes, that for ETG [ph] in the quarter. I'm sorry, the question you just asked. Could you repeat that, please? I don't think it's material to us. We do have in a fuel business as F-35 content. But overall, it's not a material change. So overall, all in for the year right now, I think our expectations are pretty much what they were at the -- during our last call. It is the general markets that all-in gave up ground in the quarter as we expected they would. We're beginning to see some, what I'd call, the proverbial green shoots in a few of the businesses but we're still not running at order levels higher than prior year. And I -- as I kind of talked about before, I expect that sometime over the next couple of quarters, orders to start to reverse overall. And then -- one second. Thank you. [Indiscernible] off here in the room. And then I would expect that if you factor in lead times onto the backlog -- on to the orders and so on, as we get later in the year, that starts to turn overall in the right direction in terms of revenue. Thanks for asking. It's a good question. We're not seeing much of it. It has really improved, whether it's exactly back to normal. I'm not sure because I'm not sure what the new normal will be, in fact but I wouldn't -- I would say that at this point, supply chain is almost back to where it was. And the -- the labor market is -- has been challenging for a while and continues to be. And so I would say that impacts us as much, if not more, probably these days than the supply chain, just getting good, qualified people into the businesses. Yes, we're very happy we own it. It's doing essentially as we expected and a lot of good potential ahead. Also, they're looking at a number of acquisitions we've been able to bring to them, they bring up some. We'll see whether they transpire. But a lot of good things happening there and so far, so good. I just might add something to -- this is Victor, what Carlos had to say. We continue to look at acquisitions. Most are in our historical -- overwhelmingly in our historical size. And we have an excellent acquisition pipeline, very strong. Again, whether we do that remains to be seen. But we will continue to those acquisitions that would fit the right way while being mindful of the importance of reducing debt and capital structure. Sure. Sheila, a couple of things. One, I would be surprised to see a sub-20% rate in Q2. Number two, the sales difference was not based on pricing, it was based on the shipment schedule. So we -- I would call it a fairly normal pricing environment which means in some instances, the customers can accept the prices that recognize our cost that maybe higher and other instances we have longer term contracts where pricing is a lot thin. So it's kind of a normal scenario on the pricing side. Really, on the revenue side, it was all about the shipment schedule and when things were supposed to ship. It's not necessarily, by the way, the production rate. So we try to keep the facilities level loaded. Our businesses try to stay level loaded in production. But it depends upon when the order is due for delivery or acceptance and test by the customer, that dictates a lot of how it works for us. So again, just to emphasize, I would expect north of 20% GAAP margin -- operating margin on the quarter which, of course, would be north of 24% the true margin, excluding intangibles amortization. Not really other than the shipment schedules in our higher-margin businesses were lower than they had been in the prior period and that brings down the margin. But I don't want to break out which business is what margins but I think our business... Sure, this is Victor. It is a very good question. And by the way, when I say across the board, it doesn't mean in every business but it's kind of -- I should clarify what I mean by that is the majority of the business or sort of the super majority of the businesses. It is what I could call, the trend; there is a tremendous amount of opportunity for our businesses or newer and evolved products. Sometimes it's not just what you would consider revolutionary change, right? It's not necessarily developing something that is wholly new. In our case, it is more typically evolutionary and it is an improvement on an earlier version or iteration of a product. And so what we're seeing in a high number of our customers is demand for what you would consider our next generation of products. So it's not just technology based. It's not for example as though there is a new design that has been developed. Like Bluetooth came up many years and everybody was implementing Bluetooth. It's not like that. It's more responsive to the individual needs of our customers. So we leave it to each one of our businesses to make those choices. In some cases, it's customer-initiated. In other cases, it's initiated by our subsidiaries or somewhere in between. I mean our businesses had regular meetings and visits and calls with customers. And so they're aware of new programs, the customer may be on. New designs that they might need. And that's probably the most typical but it runs the gamut, depending on the architecture of the particular business as well as the products. But the key to it is, one, a willingness to always invest and respond to the customer needs depending upon the history and relationship with the customer, the likelihood that they will, in fact, turn into orders. I mean let's be honest, there are companies who will always ask their suppliers, their vendors, partners to develop something on their dime. And then they may not buy it. So that is a factor that we consider is what is the history with the customer? Are they likely to, in fact, convert to orders? Is there a PO standing behind it? Are they on a program of record, for example, if it's defense and where do they stand with that program? What Intel are we getting in the broader community? What do we hear from our other partners, customers, even trade shows, government people, things like that. So each business, though, is responsible for that. And that, to be honest, the beauty, I think, of our company is that it's not from on high, it is experts talking with experts. We believe in devolving those decisions down at the lowest level to be able to understand the customer best. Yes, Louis, it's continued overall all-in to grow. And so what I was segmenting out was the areas that were weak as before but defense is as we expect and moving in the right direction."

            "name": "Laurans Mendelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Samara and welcome to everybody on this call. We thank you for joining us and we welcome you to the HEICO first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings announcement teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson and Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another very, very strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operating at peak performance level continued to fuel our excellent financial results. I personally have never been more optimistic about the future of HEICO. I would now like to summarize the highlights of our first quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improved by 39% and 44%, respectively as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23. These results reflect mainly a 12% organic net sales growth in Flight Support, commercial aerospace products and services as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 23% to $114.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and '23 were both favorably impacted by a discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal '24, net of controlling interest, was $13.3 million and that was up from $6.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated EBITDA increased 43% to $224.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $157.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. I mean that is an enormous increase, if I say so myself. The Flight Support Group set an all-time quarterly net sales and operating income record in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improving 67% and 63% respectively, over the first quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor and 12% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.79x as of January 31, '24 and that was down from 3.0x as of August 31, '23. When we acquired Wencor, our pro forma leverage ratio was slightly above 3x. And we had projected pro forma leverage to be 2x within 12 to 18 months post-acquisition. At this time, I am pleased to report that we continue to remain on track to achieve this target. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 46% to $111.7 million in the first quarter fiscal '24 and that was up from $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '24. In January '24, we paid our regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share and this represented our 91st consecutive semi-annual cash dividend since 1979. In January '24, we were honored to announce that I received the Kenn Ricci Lifetime Aviation Entrepreneur Award from the Living Legends of the Aviation Organization. The Living Legends of Aviation recognition is given to remarkable people of extraordinary accomplishment in aviation, including entrepreneurs, innovators, industry leaders, astronauts, record breakers, pilots who become celebrities and celebrities who have become pilots. I was profoundly humbled and honored that this storied and a unique organization would include me with such aviation and space pioneers for this special honor. However, in my opinion, the honor really belongs to HEICO's 10,000-plus team members who are the ones that make HEICO the great company that it is. Now let me discuss our recent acquisition activity. In December '23, we entered into an exclusive license and acquired certain assets for the capability to support Boeing 737NG/777 cockpit display and legacy display products line from Honeywell International. We do expect the exclusive license and asset acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in the year following closing. The acquisition broadens our avionics capability and it's another example of ways that HEICO has grown into adjacent markets to increase our overall value proposition to customers and the industry. At this time, I would now like to introduce Eric Mendelson who is Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group. He will discuss the first quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric? Thank you, Victor. I think it should be clear to everyone on this call that Victor and we are expecting a quite different result from ETG from the second quarter through the end of the year. And in the first quarter, some people, I think, misunderstood and they said, \"Oh, ETG is not doing well.\" And I think Victor explained it very well. So you understand that it is a lumpy business and the sales and earnings should come through from the second to the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support and ETG principally driven by contributions from our fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions as well as demand for the majority of our products. Notably, we fully expect future ETG quarters to be materially stronger than the first quarter. In addition, we plan to continue our commitment to developing new products and services with further market penetration as well as maintaining our financial strength and our flexibility. In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Our strategy of growing a highly diversified portfolio of excellent businesses continues to produce favorable results for all shareholders. Our end markets are very healthy and fiscal '24 is looking to be another great year. Thank you for your continued confidence. And as I said before, I have never been more bullish about HEICO's future. One other comment. We do not now give any guidance. Some analysts have asked us to give guidance. We prefer not to. However, I have said publicly that our goal is to grow net income 15% to 20% annually compounded. Over the last 30 to 33 years, I think, we have done that and the actual growth has been somewhere around 18% or 19%. I can tell you that based on everything that I know at this moment and based upon our -- what we expect for the future of this year. I clearly am highly confident that we will attain that 15% to 20% growth in the current year and that without any future acquisitions which we might make. So with that, I would like to turn the call back to our operator, Samara and open the call for questions from listeners. I thank you again very much. Samara? Just to further expand on what Victor said, it's completely correct. It's a balancing act. We are in the business of expanding, creating cash flow and bottom line income. And if we see an outstanding acquisition, we will make it. At the same time, we have to watch our debt level and we're trying to reduce it. So as you saw, we made a Honeywell acquisition recently because we believe it will be very accretive and very positive cash flow. So we made the decision to acquire it by using debt which reduced our ability to reduce our debt to overall debt. But on the bottom line, it was helpful to HEICO and actually where you get more income and debt. So the balance actually benefits the ratio of debt to EBITDA. But anyway, this is all a balancing act and we watch it very, very carefully because, as you know, we are focused on bottom line cash flow. So we will make these acquisitions when they are very, very desirable and we might have to use some debt but we'll take each one as it comes. We are here to grow HEICO bottom line cash flow. Again, it's a balancing act and we're very careful with it. Well, it could be the result of all 3. And however, we try to control earnings growth. We really do. And HEICO, I think investors like consistency. I know we're probably the largest single investor in our company to get 401(k) and Carlos and -- so we like consistency. We don't like to go up 1 year, down the other. In order to do that and to generate cash flow, so we don't get over leverage. We'd like to continue to be within 15% to 20%. So it is possible we could go over 20%. At this point, everything I know in my -- our own thought projections, we will be within 15% to 20% -- would we go over it, it's possible. But at this moment, I wouldn't predict that. Again, I am conservative. And however, I do say that my own guesstimate is that we will be within 15% to 20%. So I don't know if that answers your question. But the other thing is I see that both of our businesses are really very strong. You've heard the whole story. And Victor has described the first quarter of ETG is really a weak quarter because we couldn't ship and these various things. The backlog supports a huge increase from the second to the fourth quarter. So we should see the ETG definitely level out and return to what I would call reasonably normal profitability. Flight Support similarly is very strong, too. And with the Wencor acquisition and the possibilities of gaining some of the synergies which we're doing very slowly and we want to build it in. But it's a long answer to your question but I really think at this point, we'll be within 15% to 20% growth. And if we go over, I can't predict who might do it. The answer is if it was super sensational and it really added to the bottom line and we looked at it and the payback as a result of it would drop us below the 3x back into the 2x area, we might consider it. We're very careful with debt and also interest rates are very, very high. So to make these acquisitions now because of interest rates, it's a little bit harder. So to answer your question, it would have to be something sensational to make us go above 3x. And so far, I have not seen something so sensational. So I think it's highly unlikely but as we get from, say, just under 3x as we head to 2x which we estimate in the press release, we said 12 to 18 months from the time we incurred the debt and that's -- we believe that's accurate. But along the way, we might find, as we did with Honeywell, a very accretive cash flow and EPS acquisition which would actually make the ratio, if you do the arithmetic, you make the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA would go down because of the earnings that it would produce, we would do that. So again, that's why I say it takes a lot of thought process. We just don't make acquisitions willy-nilly. And remember one thing, that the Mendelsons as a family and our 401(k) we're there to protect that nest egg [ph]. And we're going to be very careful in incurring any kind of debt and we don't want to get into any kind of financial problem. We have great cash flow. We have a great business. It's growing nicely. So we'll be very careful with that debt. I don't know if that answers your question. Well, I would like to again thank everyone on this call for their interest in HEICO. We are available; if you have other questions, you can contact Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself. And if you don't, we look forward to speaking to you on the second quarter earnings teleconference. That's the end of this teleconference. And again, thank you. Have a wonderful day."

            "content": "The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 67% to a record $618.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $371.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor which continues to perform above our expectations as well as strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects high teens organic net sales growth from both our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 63% to a record $136 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 principally reflects the pre-mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by higher, as expected, intangible asset amortization expenses due to the Wencor acquisition well as increased inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 22% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group's operating margin before intangible amortization expense was 24.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 versus 24.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The small decrease in operating margin principally reflects a slightly lower gross profit margin in the previously mentioned higher expected intangible asset amortization expense due to the Wencor acquisition partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Now, I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the first quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group. So thanks for your question, Scott. With regard to what we see in the market, the market continues to be extremely strong across the board. I think yes, the large commercial carriers are particularly strong. There has been a little bit of weakness in -- with some of the lower-cost carriers. But nothing really pronounced at this point. There are natural order patterns where things can get a little lumpy shift around. So I don't want to -- I wouldn't want to predict any weakness there. Right now, there continues to be a shortage of parts. Airlines are still in need of parts, are still trying to grow their inventory. So we see the market as very strong. Yes, that's a good question. The Wencor acquisition has been exceeding expectations in every single area, the business, the people, the strategy, it's been incredibly strong. And we had very high expectations for it and they are even beating those numbers. Specifically, looking at areas of best practices. I would say that HEICO is particularly strong in the technical arena. Wencor is also strong in the technical arena. But I think there are some things where Wencor has been able to benefit from us as well as HEICO benefiting from Wencor and other areas. And then in particular, in the e-commerce area. I think Wencor has been able to benefit HEICO in that area. So we see continued synergies without integration. So we -- our plan is to continue to operate Wencor for the time being or for the foreseeable future as an independent business. And that's the DNA of HEICO. That's how we operate all of the HEICO businesses and we want Wencor to continue, obviously, to have its own P&L, its own strategy, its own team members and HEICO is strongest when each of the individual business units take care of themselves and coordinate with the other ones. So I would say that I look at the cooperation between HEICO and Wencor is somewhat analogous between the cooperation, if you look at a number of the European airline groups. We look at Lufthansa and Swiss or Air France and KLM or British Airways and Iberia and they maintain their independence, their separate touch and feel and relationships with the customers, separate people but they coordinate some of the activities behind the scenes, making sure that they're -- the schedules and the product offerings are supportive of each other. And that's what we've been able to do very successfully. So Wencor continues as an individual autonomous business, no plan to change that. And we are making sure that we provide tremendous value to our customers as a result of making sure we don't have, for example, product development overlap, where we rationalized some of the repair offerings in various centers of excellence focused on different products and technology. So our customers have been very happy as a result of the acquisition and are really excited about where we're headed there. And I think they really want to reward us with a significant additional new business. They view HEICO in a very different light as a result of the Wencor merger. Well, the first quarter was very strong at 22%. And when you add back the [indiscernible] amortization, we get to about 24.8%, so extremely strong. We anticipate continued strength. I think I want to be a little bit conservative going forward. We often go ahead and we come out with our budgets and our numbers and our folks end up beating those numbers. But maybe Carlos wants to shed some light specifically on that. Noah, that's a great and insightful question. The short answer is I think we need to do both. We need to adjust pricing to reflect our increased costs and we also need to grow market share. So that is the strategy. We have a number of customers who have been purchasing parts at fairly old prices before there was cost inflation. So we need to make sure that we pass along our cost increases. And I think our customers are very understanding of that. Some customers get it and are just fine and go ahead and incorporate the other -- the new pricing. Other customers want to have the discussion over it and we -- obviously, we don't show them what our costs are but we explain what's happened to our costs and this is only reasonable. So honestly, I think that our pricing has been a lot more conservative and gentle then it could be. Our competitors are substantially raising prices, we're seeing now last night from a -- I don't want to call out the OEM but it's an OEM that everybody knows and they increased price twice last year, once 10% and another time 18%. And by the way, I will mention it was not TransDigm. So I know people are very interested in the TransDigm story but it was not TransDigm. So it shows how pervasive the price increases are. So I think that we've been very mild. And I think, frankly, with costs going up and the need to spend additional dollars on new product development that it would be reasonable to have additional increases. And I think we'll be able to capture market share at the same time. So I don't think those two are mutually exclusive. We've -- if you talk to the airlines, I mean nobody wants the price increase, as you say. But the airlines all recognize that HEICO has been extremely gentle with regards to price increase. And frankly, in areas where we have been more restrictive on price increase, we anticipate significant share gains as well. Yes. I would say they did. Boeing had some challenges and as a result, the new bill has been impaired. So that definitely had an impact on specialty products. I would also like to point out that while specialty product sales were a little soft and caused the reported organic growth rate to be, if you will, understated because the aftermarket growth rate was very high teens. A lot of the -- we're very bullish on the future. And a lot of what specialty products does is on the defense side. And as you know, in a lot of missile defense and space programs, rocket motor programs, these are very long lead time items. So our order book is extremely strong. We're very, very bullish on the future. We feel that we're well embedded. We've got some great secular trends we are the low-cost, high-quality, sole-source producer on most of the stuff and we think that the future will be very good. So I'm not at all concerned about the specialty products being down. And I think Boeing also will get their act together. I mean, obviously, they've got some challenges that we've all read about but Boeing is still a great company. And I think that they'll get that all figured out and it will permit our specialty products to grow at sort of more historic rates. I need to look at specifically with regard to next quarter but what you're saying sounds logical. Yes. Larry, I'd be happy to answer that. The strength within site support on the aftermarket side has really been across the board. I would say, in general, a little more strength in the parts side as compared to the repair side. Airlines are finding the equipment hard. It's more difficult to get things repaired but in general, I would say the parts side is a little bit stronger but the repair side is also doing very well as well. As far as market share gains, we continue to grow market share. Our customers are really happy with us. And speaking with our sales head yesterday, I have specific information from a number of customers that they really are very, very happy as a result of the Wencor acquisition. While HEICO was always a significant player in the space. And so it was Wencor, the fact that we've come together and we can offer a broader product line, a broader suite of products is really significant. And a fair amount of energy was spent in each business focusing on capturing as much as it could. And now by creating more of these centers of excellence, where each business focus is on where it has a true competitive advantage it doesn't need to, if you will, reinvent the wheel, makes a lot of sense. And our customers are really happy about that because we're able to provide a much fuller suite of offering to the customers and they recognize that this is true structural advantage that they can benefit from as opposed to more niche-oriented strategy. So market share gains, we have had some pricing gains. I don't have a breakout between the two. But I wouldn't say that market share is definitely the leading number there. That is -- that's one way to think about it. I'm also really looking at it as how the product sets are very complementary, number one. Number two, without getting into specific customers, I would say there are a number of extremely strong relationships, sales relationships on the Wencor side as well as the HEICO side. And I think that we can help each other. The businesses can help each other with sharing those relationships and just basically one hand, helping the other. If you look historically, we've taken up our margins over the last decade that you covered us quite significantly and frankly, an even beat where I thought they would be. And I think that there is more potential in that regard. There's some -- there's a lot of sharing that also can occur over on the repair side in terms of DER repairs as well as they're already using the PMA parts. So I think that, that's an advantage. In the defense side, we're already cooperating and working together, whereas orders used to go out to third-party companies that are now being placed internally and that's very strong likewise over in our specialty manufacturing. There's a lot of product that our specialty manufacturing group can build for our other businesses including Wencor and we're really pushing that as well. So I think it's just a very broad-based level of cooperation, as I said, without integration. When you've got really talented people who are running these businesses, who have really mastered their businesses, we find that by getting them autonomy, that's very intrinsically motivating feature. And that's not something that exists in many companies. If you look at HEICO overall across all of HEICO, we've got roughly 100 business heads and for a company of our size to have 100 people of this talent and skill set where they performed so well and they really enjoy what they do because of way that they're treated, I think that's the real synergy here. It's not going to be from knocking out little costs here and there. I mean, yes, there's an opportunity to do that. And for example, in trade shows, in a number of the trade shows, Paris, Farmborough and others will have booths together. So HEICO and Wencor will be together. There'll be certain other trade shows where they can be separate. And we want the businesses to each have their own strategy and to really take responsibility for the results. So I think that's why we're getting these benefits. Sure. Mariana, this is Eric. I'd be happy to answer about that. So HEICO has done a number of licensing deals over the last decade. So we're very well experienced on doing those licensing deals. And in particular, when you look at the component repair footprint, HEICO has got 19 individual MRO businesses just within Flight Support. And then over in ETG, there are another number of them there as well. So we've been able to buy these licenses and basically take the technology and put it into a business that's already incredibly experienced in that market niche and really understands the technology. So when we buy a license, we're able then to go out to the customer with people who can hit the ground running in many cases, are already working with the customer on other items and it's really a seamless experience. So I think that there is plenty of opportunity for HEICO in this area to continue to grow in adjacent white spaces. I can tell you that our reception at the customers for the Honeywell product has been extremely strong. They've been very happy about that. They're used to our experience with regard to quality, turn time and price. So the reception has been very strong. So I think that it was a great move for both Honeywell as well as for HEICO as well as for our customers. There's just a net benefit increase to the industry here. So I think that there is additional opportunity for us. Yes. We're -- Gautam, this is Eric. So you want to know how we're doing with regard to aftermarket and OE on order pattern or what you like me to comment on? Well, so our distribution businesses are doing extremely well. They're continuing to gain market share. They have the right inventories. I think our customers are very happy as a result of working with them. Likewise over in the PMA area where we -- and the repair area where we sell direct, it's likewise -- it's the same thing. So I would say a very good strength in both. With regard to product availability on the flight support side, things are tough where, frankly, our vendors are quite behind. And I think our results could be even better if they were able to shift the overdue backlog. And this is really across the board in the parts area. I would say both the PMA as well as the distribution. I think there have been some raw material challenges as a result of the sanctions. And then, of course, as Victor alluded to with regard to labor, that continues to be a challenge. But definitely, the supply chain is tight. There really isn't -- there's no excess capacity. Things are very tight. And we're hoping that by the end of '24, things normalize, Frankly, I would have thought by now things would have normalized more. But unfortunately, our vendors are -- they're really struggling. Things will get better after November in a lot of ways. Yes, it's a good question, Bert. We don't have that many new customers and that's pretty much because we deal with everybody. So occasionally, when an airline gets formed, there can be a new one. I would say that our biggest opportunity is to continue to increase our market penetration with our existing customers. So that really is where the big opportunity is as opposed to new ones. I mean we do get new ones but we're pretty much dealing with everybody in the world. So like a new airline gets created, there wouldn't be that type of opportunity. The answer is yes. So if a customer is buying a product and it's under contract, then obviously, they would have price protection for the terms of the contract, the duration of the contract if that's what it's provided for. And of course, there are different things which matter to different customers. So we're very accommodating there. However, if a customer -- if that customer wants to start buying a part that they haven't purchased, then they would get a price based on the new list price as opposed to what the old price was. So there's definitely a big incentive to get started and get locked in with us as early as possible."
