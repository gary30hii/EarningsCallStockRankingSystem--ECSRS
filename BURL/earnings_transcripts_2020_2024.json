Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's fourth quarter earnings call. We are very glad that you could be with us. We're going to structure this morning's discussion as follows. First, I will review our fourth quarter results; second, I will talk about the outlook for 2021; third, I will discuss the market share opportunities that we see ahead of us; and fourth, I will provide an update on our Burlington 2.0 strategy and key initiatives. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to any questions. I would like to start my review of the fourth quarter by acknowledging our store teams with their strong execution of safety and social distancing protocols in our stores and for providing a safe environment for our associates and our customers in Q4 and indeed, throughout 2020. This attention to safety in our stores was critical to supporting our business. Okay. So let's talk about our results. Comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were flat versus last year. We were down 10% in November, flat in December and up positive 17% in January. I would like to provide some detail on the drivers of this month-by-month comparable store sales performance. As we discussed on the third quarter call, we believe that the weak trend in November was driven by unseasonably warm weather. Given the legacy of our brand and our particular strength in outerwear, our usually warm weather in the fall tends to hurt our traffic and sales more than most other retailers. This was the primary driver of the 10% comp store sales decline for the month. Our sales trend improved significantly in December, as weather normalized, traffic improvement and customers responded to the great merchandise values that they found in our stores. We chased over $100 million of sales above our internal plan in December. We were particularly pleased with this improvement in the sales trend in December, given the external environment. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country meant that we faced lower occupancy limits in many stores and reduced operating hours in some of our major markets. We improved to a flat comp in December despite these limitations.\n\u2013 : Our gross margin in Q4 was up approximately 40 basis points, despite a 70 basis point increase in freight expense. I was very pleased with the 110 basis point increase in our merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower markdowns. Our receipts are fresher. We are turning faster, and we are capturing the margin benefits of these faster inventory terms. The buying environment in the fourth quarter was very favorable, and we were able to finance great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales trend. At year end, our in-store inventory levels were down 16% on a comp store basis. As a reminder, at the same point last year, they were down 15%, on a two year basis, we are operating with significantly less in-store inventory. This is deliberate and consistent with our stated strategy of running our business with much leaner in-store inventory levels. In fact, our in-store inventory turns increased 27% on a comparable basis for Q4, evidence that our strategy is working. Reserve inventory increased to 38% of our total inventory at the end of the fourth quarter versus 33% last year. This would have been higher, but for the fact that we released some of our reserve early. This was merchandise that we had originally planned to release in February that we accelerated into January to support sales and replenish in-store inventory. Of course, this is exactly what reserve inventory is intended for. I would like to turn now to the outlook for 2021. The consumer environment remains very unpredictable. The pace of vaccine rollouts, the spread of virus mutations, the timing of tax refunds and the potential for additional federal stimulus, these are all variables that we have no control over and have very little visibility into. These variables could dramatically impact our sales trend in either direction. As John will discuss later in the call, we have planned and we will be reporting fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019. This is to avoid a lack of comparability in our fiscal 2020 results. For internal baseline planning purposes, we are assuming a flattish comp for 2021 compared to 2019, but it is important to understand that this is just a baseline. We intend to manage our business very flexibly. If our comp during 2021 is stronger than flat, then as demonstrated in Q4, we have the ability to chase a stronger sales trend. And conversely, of course, we can pull back if that turns out to be necessary. I would like to move on now to talk about the exciting longer term market share opportunities that we see ahead of us. For many years now, long predating the pandemic, the e-commerce and off-price retail sectors have been gaining market share at the expense of department stores. We believe that the aftermath of the pandemic may drive an acceleration of this trend, leading to further consolidation and additional closures of full price bricks-and-mortar retail stores. As we have described before, as these physical stores close, we believe that many shoppers, especially more affluent, time-starved shoppers will migrate more of their spending online, but we anticipate that other shoppers, more value-oriented shoppers will find their way to off-price. With all that said, we recognize that none of the shoppers in our stores cares about our market share, what they care about, as they should, is finding great value on brand, or a style, or an item that they love. Our focus and the central objective of our Burlington 2.0 strategy is to improve our ability to deliver this great merchandise value. I would like to pivot now and offer some updates on Burlington 2.0. As I said earlier, we believe our strong performance relative to our expectations in Q4 was primarily driven by the successful execution of our core Burlington 2.0 strategies, delivering great value to customers by tightly managing liquidity, chasing sales, buying opportunistically, operating lean inventories, getting fresh receipts to the sales floor as fast as possible and flexing our store model based on receipts and traffic. As we move into 2021, we will continue to look for ways to refine and improve our execution of these key strategies. One of the most important long-term enablers of delivering great merchandise value to customers is to invest in our buying and planning capabilities. As I mentioned in our November call, we are pursuing a major multi-year growth plan for our buying and planning organization. We are heavily investing in these capabilities, and we'll be growing this organization at a much faster rate than sales. This expansion will happen across all merchandise categories and in each of our buying offices. The growth will be especially significant in our New York City and our West Coast buying offices. Headcount in both these locations will grow several fold in the next few years. We have very strong vendor relationships today, but we want to further expand and develop these key partnerships. We recognize that, in some cases, having a stronger on the ground presence in New York City and Los Angeles will help us to achieve this. The final update that I would like to provide is on our real estate strategy. As discussed on our November call, our real estate and store operations teams have done a lot of work in the past year on a 25,000 square foot store prototype. We are excited about this prototype. We expect that about a-third of our new store openings in 2021 will be in this format, and that over time, this smaller prototype will grow to represent the majority of our new store openings. Of course, the key enabler of moving to this smaller prototype is to operate with leaner in-store inventory levels. When you have less in-store inventory, you need less physical space. This has significant economic benefits, translating to lower occupancy costs and higher operating margins. The smaller prototype also provides important strategic benefits, increasing the pool of potential real estate sites and providing the opportunity to open profitable stores in more locations around the United States. We are very excited to announce that based on these factors, we are raising our long-term potential store count to 2,000 stores from our previous goal of 1,000 stores. As a reminder, we had 761 stores as we began this fiscal year. So clearly, we have a lot of runway and opportunity ahead of us. Bringing it back to this year, as John will describe in a moment, we plan to open approximately 100 new stores in 2021, while closing or relocating approximately 25 stores for a total increase of 75 net new stores. Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate the pace of newer openings each year. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials. John?\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the fourth quarter, total sales increased 4%, while comparable store sales were flat. The gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points versus last year's rate of 42.1%. This improvement was driven by a 110 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns. This merchandise margin increase more than offset a significant increase in freight expense, which increased 70 basis points over last year's rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs, were $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $89 million last year, increasing 230 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year. Higher supply chain costs accounted for 180 basis points of this deleverage. This was consistent with the expectations that we discussed in our third quarter call last November. The major drivers were higher wage rates, higher wage incentives, the impact of lower AUR and product mix and inefficiencies caused by safety protocols and the general disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain. The balance of deleverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs. This is consistent with Burlington 2.0 and our strategy of investing in our merchandising capabilities. Adjusted SG&A was $554 million versus $499 million last year, increasing 160 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increases in store-related and corporate costs, including $39 million in COVID-related expenses. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $70 million to $224 million. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.33 versus $3.08 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.44 versus $3.21. During the quarter, the company paid down the $250 million previously outstanding on its ABL facility, ending the fourth quarter with no outstanding balance. We ended the period with available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and total balance sheet debt of approximately $1.9 billion. Before I provide our outlook, I wanted to comment on how we are approaching, planning our business and reviewing our performance during this year. As you know, fiscal 2020 was a highly unusual and volatile year, making comparability of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 very difficult. Accordingly, not only are the plans we have developed benchmarked against fiscal 2019, but our comparable store sales results and many of the financial measures we will be reporting in fiscal 2021 will be compared to fiscal 2019 as well. Given the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, we are not prepared at this time to give specific sales or earnings guidance for fiscal 2021. That said, we can provide some guidelines to help you model fiscal 2021. Let's start with sales. As Michael said, for internal planning purposes, we are using a baseline of flat comp in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. In a moment, we will discuss the cost headwinds that we expect to face in fiscal 2021, but before we do that, it's important to call out that as we compare 2021 to 2019, we will have naturally incurred two years of expense growth. Typically on a flat comp, our EBIT margin would decline 20 basis points to 30 basis points on a one year basis or 40 basis points to 60 basis points over two years of expense growth. Staying with sales for a moment, as you think about total sales growth for FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should factor in two years of new stores over that time period, 34 net new stores in fiscal 2020 and 75 planned net new stores in fiscal 2021. Moving on to gross margin, we expect higher freight costs to continue to pressure our reported gross margin in fiscal 2021, but we do expect merchandise margin improvement to offset higher freight costs as we continue to plan our comp store inventories down, which should result in further reduction in our markdown rate. Moving down the P&L, we expect continued cost pressure and deleverage from product sourcing costs in 2021 primarily from higher supply chain costs. We expect significant deleverage versus 2019, driven by similar headwinds to those we experienced in the fourth quarter. In terms of SG&A in FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should also factor in ongoing COVID related SG&A expenses in fiscal 2021. After combining the deleveraging effect of a two year flat comp, the incremental expense pressures that I just outlined, and various offsets and mitigation strategies that we have identified so far, our modeling would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 basis points to 80 basis points, if comp sales are actually flat in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. Again, to be clear, this is based on comp store sales growth being flat on a two year basis. If our comp store sales growth is stronger than this, then we would expect our operating margin performance to be better. Finally, let me share some specific outlook items for your modeling purposes. Net capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $470 million net of landlord allowances. In fiscal 2021, we expect to open 100 new stores, we are closing or relocating 25 stores, resulting in 75 planned net new stores. This includes 18 new stores that were shifted from fiscal 2020 into fiscal 2021.  Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favourable lease cost, is expected to be approximately $260 million. Interest expense, excluding $32 million in non-cash interest on the convertible notes, is expected to be approximately $80 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25%. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to thank the entire team at Burlington. It is an understatement to say that we operated in a very difficult environment in 2020. I am proud of how the Burlington organization handled these challenges, and I'm amazed at the progress we made on our strategic priorities.  To express this appreciation, we announced earlier today that we will be paying a special thank-you bonus to the majority of our store, supply chain and corporate office associates, in recognition of their hard work and commitment in 2020. This is a very exciting time for us at Burlington. We are all energized by the significant growth opportunities we see ahead of us and by the strategies we are pursuing to go after these. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan.\nMatt Boss: Great. Thanks and congrats on the material improvement. So Michael, first, how did you arrive at the baseline comp assumption that you're using for planning purposes this year? And more so, could you just elaborate on your thinking behind this forecast overall?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Well, Matt, good morning. Great to hear from you. I guess, there were really two main thoughts behind this baseline. Firstly, I should reiterate, 2021 is a very difficult year to forecast. There are a number of potential positives, the rollout of vaccines and the potential for additional stimulus spending, but there are also some risks and some negatives. The possible spread of additional variants, the continuing high unemployment rate, so a lot of uncertainty.  But with all that uncertainty, we need a baseline that we can plan against, but one that will give us flexibility so we can chase the trend, if our comp growth turns out to be stronger or we can pull back if we need to. Our feeling is that -- by starting with a flattish baseline, we could move it in the direction. So that was the first thought.  The second thought is that our recent trend gives us confidence that this is a good baseline to start with. So let me talk about Q4, and then I'll talk about the quarter to-date. So Q4, obviously, we just reported a flat comp for Q4, but there are a couple of important puts and takes to this number. We know that the federal stimulus checks helped us in January. And conversely, we also know that the unseasonably warm weather really hurt us in November. After adjusting for these specific factors, we estimate that our underlying comp store sales trend in Q4 was down around 1%, so minus 1%. The other data point is our quarter-to-date trend. Now I caution you, we're only, what, 4.5 weeks into a 13-week quarter, but at this point, our quarter-to-date trend is flat. In other words, at this point in the quarter, our trend is consistent with the baseline plan that I've just described. So I guess to summarize it, 2021 is going to be a tough year to forecast. Lots of things that could happen that could help or hurt sales. And what we need to do is to plan our business and be ready to react to a stronger or weaker trend as we did in Q4. And given \u2013 as I said, given the data that we have right now, it feels like a flat comp seems like a reasonable assumption for baseline planning purposes.\nMatt Boss: That's great. Congratulations on the performance in February, particularly given the weather that I know certain parts of the country have seen. As a follow-up for John, how best to think about 2021 margin pressures, maybe in the context of your goal to close the margin gap versus peers over time? Meaning, do you see any structural barriers that might make this more difficult?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks. It's a good question. I think maybe the best way to answer, it might be to separate out into two different time periods. First, the period from now until we kind of get through the whole pandemic thing. And then \u2013 that could be maybe the next 12 months. And second, the period after we emerged from the pandemic. So that's probably 2022 and beyond. For that first-time period, maybe up to the next 12 months, hopefully, a little shorter. The sales trend is still going to be really difficult to predict. Traffic into our stores is probably going to continue to be off, the industry-wide supply chain issues that we're seeing are probably going to continue, putting pressure on freight and supply chain expenses and the various COVID related safety measures that we have in our stores and distribution centers will likely need to remain in place for some time. As I said in the prepared remarks, if you combine the deleveraging effect of a two-year flat comp plus the expense pressures in the various offsets that we've identified, this would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 to 80 basis points. If comps store sales are actually flat in 2021 versus 2019. As we said previously, we typically don't expect margin leverage unless we achieve a 2% to 3% comp sales growth in a year. So for 2021, this would require two-year comp growth of 4% to 6% versus 2019. If the recovery from the pandemic were to accelerate over the next few months, and our comp trend were to pick up then we could be back on track, but that all depends on external factors [will be and what] [ph] we can actually control. All right. So, let's switch over and talk about the subsequent time period after the pandemic. At this point, when that's all behind us, we don't see any structural expense changes that would interfere with our longer term margin opportunity. As we've discussed in the past, we see three main drivers of operating margin improvement, of course, the first one is sales; higher sales productivity drives leverage. There are a number of steps that we're taking to drive sales, focusing on [wow] [ph] values, gently controlling liquidity, chasing the sales trend, going after great opportunistic buys and investing in our merchandising capabilities. The second piece would be gross margin. We think we have a significant opportunity to continue to turn our inventories faster than we have historically. And by doing that that's going to drive lower markdowns. I think we demonstrated that pretty well in Q3 and especially in Q4 of 2020 and that gives us a lot of confidence that we have additional opportunity to increase our turns. The third part -- point I'd mention is occupancy costs. Our stores are bigger than less and less productive than our peers. Driving higher sales will help, but as we discussed in our prepared remarks, we also see a significant opportunity to reduce the size of the store, which in turn would reduce occupancy costs in our stores over time. Referring to 2.0, we have specific initiatives in place to go after each of these opportunity areas. Despite all the challenges we faced in 2020, we're really happy with the progress that we made in each of these areas. Most importantly, we remain confident that with good execution, we will drive a significant improvement in operating margin in the next several years once we have the pandemic behind us.\nMatt Boss: Great color. Best of luck.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning, everyone. Two questions. First for John, on the product sourcing costs, major source of deleverage in the fourth quarter. Just any more detail you can give us on the puts and takes on that line item? And then to that point, I think it's been, I mean, $143 million in the last two quarters. Is that a good way to think about the next couple of quarters as we start the first half?\nJohn Crimmins: Yeah, good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. The product sourcing cost is complicated. So let me kind of explain the way that we think about it. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, product sourcing costs delevered by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter. Higher supply chain costs represented 180 bps of that deleverage. So let's talk about that first. It's probably of use if I break it into a few buckets. First, 90 bps of the supply chain deleverage came from higher wage rates and from wage incentives, similar to what we discussed in the third quarter. The higher wage rates accounted for about half of the 90 bps, and we expect that increase to be permanent. We anticipate that over time, we're likely to find some efficiencies that could partially offset the higher costs; the other half came from the temporary wage rate incentives. These were used to increase staffing when extra work was needed to overcome situational factors, like the receipt flow, volatility that we faced, COVID-related safety measures, of course, we would expect these factors to abate over time. Next bucket to think about includes components of our business during the quarter and how that impacted product sourcing costs and drove some of that deleverage. So in this bucket, I throw a bunch together, I would include AUR, which was down slightly, meaning that we process more units. Category mix, which included a shift toward higher handling cost items like home. And less overall efficiency in our DC processing, resulting partly from the safety protocols and our DCs, but also from the impact of the volatility around timing of receipts and when they were going to arrive at our DCs. We had more goods moving into and out of reserve during the quarter as well, as we reacted to the disruption on those planned receipts and to our stronger than original plan sales trends. So all these factors together drove about 60 bps of the supply chain deleverage. Many of these factors are directly or indirectly related to COVID and the disruption in the global retail supply chain that we've seen and continue to see. But once the pandemic is behind us, we would expect much of this to improve. The last 30 bps of supply chain deleverage was driven by occupancy, where we added some new currently underutilized capacity and deleverage on our fixed cost base at a flat comp. With higher sales and fully utilized warehouse and DC capacity, we would expect leverage on these expenses to improve and drive operating margin expansion in the future. So just to kind of wrap it together, I think the balance of deleverage, the remaining piece of deleverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs, and that's consistent with our growing to strengthening our merchandising capabilities objective. Overtime, we would expect to see continued deleverage as we continue to invest in the team. So to the other part of your question, to the specific dollar amount, we're really staying away from specific dollar amounts, because we really don't know what the sales volume is likely to be we may have to flex up, we may have to flex down. We can't really predict what we're going to do as far as receipt processing capabilities or actual processed dollars of receipt. So I'm going to stay away from anything to do with predicting a fixed dollar amount. But as we discussed, we're going to -- whatever sales trend we see, if it's better or worse, we're going to flex with that. And our variable costs will move in the same direction. So I hope that helps.\nIke Boruchow: Yes. Thanks. And then just on -- a real quick second one. On inventory in Q4 and any comments on what you're seeing the merchandise availability out there, we know the port congestion has been talked about, but just any high-level comments there would be great?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good. Yes. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, inventory levels. Let me start with in-store inventories, and then I'll talk about reserve. Our in-store inventory levels, I would say, we're really well-controlled throughout the fourth quarter. On a comp basis, they were down 20% to 30% for most of the quarter. And just think about that for a minute. We did the same comp sales as last year, but we did that with 20% to 30% less inventory in a pandemic. So, operating with leaner inventories is a core element of our Burlington 2.0 strategy. And of course, this faster inventory turn, as John referenced in his remarks, expressed itself in higher merchant margin during the fourth quarter.  At the end of January, our in-store inventory levels were down 16%, but it's important to remember that we began to cut our inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. So this 16% cut was on top of a 15% reduction at the end of January 2019. In other words, we're now operating with much lower inventory levels than we have historically. You'd expect that we will continue to manage our in-store inventory levels slightly going forward. There will be variations depending on the quarter and the time of year. Overall, I would say that inventory level \u2013 in-store inventory levels will be down double-digits throughout 2021 compared to 2019. Let me move on to reserve inventory. Our reserve was 5% higher at the end of Q4, but that statistic doesn't really capture all the movement in and out of reserve during the quarter. In fact, our January reserve receipts, so the goods that were coming into reserve in January were actually up 42% versus last year. So what happened, of course, is that our reserve releases were up even more. They were up 62% versus last year. So reserve release has been good. So they came out of the reserve. In order to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales, we accelerated those releases from reserve. In other words, merchandise that we had planned to release to stores in February or even early March, we pulled up to support our very strong sales trend in January and to replenish our in-store inventory levels. As I said, in my earlier remarks, this is exactly what reserve inventory is intended for. We see reserve as a very important tool that our merchants can use to chase sales and take advantage of great deals in the market. But with that said, that does make it difficult to forecast what reserve inventory levels are likely to be at the end of each quarter. Reserve inventory balances could move up or down in 2021 depending upon those two things. Our sales trend versus plan and the availability of great opportunistic buys that we want to pack away.  Let me finish up the last part of your question, availability. Overall, I would say that we were very happy with availability in the fourth quarter. Our merchants were able to buy terrific merchandise at great values to support our ahead-of-plan sales in the quarter and to transition our assortment to spring. So we're very pleased with the merchandise we have in our stores right now.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks so much.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. Nice finish to a challenging year. Can you talk about the impact of industry-wide supply chain issues? You reported a nice quarter, particularly versus sell-side expectations that were out there. So I'm just wondering how incremental supply chain costs and headwinds affected borrowings and then perhaps more importantly, how they're going to affect the model in 2021?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning, John. It's actually a really good question. Let me do this. I'll provide some high-level commentary on what we're seeing in the industry and how we're working around those issues. And then I'll ask John Crimmins to talk about the financial impact. So the supply chain issues across the retail industry, I would say, over the last several months have been extraordinary. The magnitude of the bottlenecks, the congestion and the delays in getting merchandise into the country, and then moving it around the country, I would characterize all of this as unprecedented. It's not difficult to understand why this has happened. For a good chunk of last year, industry supply chains slowed down or completely shut out in some cases. And then for several months after stores reopened, retailers and vendors were understandably cautious. They didn't know what was going to happen. And then, all of a sudden, in the fourth quarter, there was a rush to bring in merchandise the holiday, and then more recently at the spring. You add to all of that, the ports, the major transportation hubs and the vendor's warehouses have struggled to operate at normal capacity because of COVID-related precautions or because of staffing issues. A few months ago, I would have said, but the situation would solidly correct itself once we got through holiday, that did not happen. There are still very, very significant industry delays coming through the ports, the transportation hubs and our vendor warehouses. And if you cope with these issues, we've had to juggle the timing of purchase orders, reserve releases and inbound CECO. I feel like we live through a version of this last summer, and we learned some important lessons. It's been very challenging. But I would say our buying, planning and supply chain teams have really been able to stay on top of that. And we've been able to get the seats that we need to support our sales trend. Even though we've been able to manage through these issues, there's clearly a financial impact in terms of higher freight rates and supply chain expenses. And in a moment, I'll let John provide more detail on how those might impact us in 2021. But before I hand off to John, let me make one final point. Usually, these situations, where merchandise orders are disruptive or delayed, usually, these situations end up expressing themselves in terms of increased off-price supply. Once these issues unwind, and of course, they will unwind, but maybe not for a little while, we think this could be a very, very good off-price buying opportunity. Okay. I'll let John Crimmins talk about the financial impact.\nJohn Crimmins: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Good morning, John. Thanks for your question. So I guess, obviously, there's two areas on our P&L that are impacted by all this stuff, freight and supply chain. And I've already talked quite a bit about in Q4. So, I'll focus a little bit more on the potential impact in 2021. As Michael was describing, these industry-wide supply chain issues haven't gone away. And now that we're in 2021, continues to be huge pressure on the ports, on rail and trucking systems across the country. And, obviously, this has had a significant impact on freight costs. We don't believe at all or even most of this cost pressure is permanent, and we would expect that at some point, supply and demand for freight is going to return to some kind of an equilibrium, but we really don't know when that's going to happen. So our expectation is that we'll be facing similar headwinds to what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we've seen so far this year well into 2021. As I said earlier, talking about gross margin for 2021, we believe that we should be able to cover these higher freight costs through higher merchant margin, driven primarily by the opportunity we see to have lower markdowns again this year. Okay. Let me move on to supply chain costs. The main impact of industry-wide issues on our supply chain is that they create unpredictability in receipt flow. This unpredictability causes inefficiencies in our distribution centers. To deal with the kind of ups and downs, ebbs and flows, we have to add chips and weekends to be staffed whenever the receipts actually do show up in our DCs and are even through to get them out to our stores. This drives up over time and it's driven some of the other wage incentives that we have in place that we talked about. Once the industry-wide situation normalizes, we would expect these expense pressures to go away as well, but again, there's no sign of that happening yet. So these costs could be with us for some time. Just one more comment, and I'm probably just going to echo something that Michael just said. At some point, these industry-wide issues and delays will resolve themselves. And when they do, this could be a really good off-price buying opportunity. So, yes, the situation is driving expense headwinds for us now, but there could be a nice silver lining for us in the future.\nJohn Kernan: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning. Interested to hear more about the increase in your store potential. Can you talk about what the thinking was behind that? How do you come to the 2,000 store number? And how confident are you in this potential?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thank you for the question. We've done a lot of work on this topic over the last 12 months, and we're very excited about this opportunity. As you know, our previous target of 1,000 stores have been in place for a while, but that estimate is pretty dated. It was based on a set of assumptions around store prototype; store economics and market share opportunity that really no longer apply. Let's start with the store prototype. As we talked before, we're introducing a new smaller 25,000 square foot store prototype, real estate; merchandise planning and store operations teams have collaborated. They\u2019ve done some really great work to develop detailed operating plans for this prototype. Over the next couple of years, we expect that this smaller format will become a central element in our new store opening plans. And as I described in my remarks, the key enabler of moving to this smaller format is to operate with leaner in-store inventory levels, which is obviously a core element of Burlington 2.0. The smaller store prototype, not surprisingly, has some significant economic benefits, and John referenced this in his remarks, the smaller footprint drives lower occupancy costs. And of course, this means higher operating margins. The smaller footprint also means improved real estate availability for new stores and relocations. We worked with a specialist, third-party analytics firm to analyze the information on our new store prototype, together with data on the demographics of our target customers. We then combined that analysis with what we're seeing in the marketplace in terms of retail real estate opportunities. The updated store count potential that we announced today is based upon all of that detailed modeling. The final point to make, though, is that with this kind of exercise, with this kind of modeling, it's important to do a reality check. Is this opportunity real? Is there enough market share opportunity to support 2,000 Burlington stores? So in addition to the detailed modeling that I've just described, we looked very closely at how retail market share might evolve over the next several years. What will happen to the share of department stores, specialty stores and more based retailers. Of course, we also looked at how successful e-commerce is likely to be in penetrating the categories that we compete in at the price points we offer and with the customer segments that we serve. The bottom-line from all of this analysis is that we feel very confident about the market share opportunity that we have ahead of us and very confident about our potential to get to 2,000 Burlington stores.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks, Michael. And then can you share any additional details on the economics of the 25,000 square foot prototype?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Sure, Lorraine. I'll take that question. So as we've kind of described, just operating in a smaller box brings your cost base down. And if we're able to drive the similar sales volume in a smaller box, everything \u2013 all of the costs related to operating in that box are less expensive. So the performance that we've seen over the last \u2013 really, it's been for a couple of years for us, but particularly in the second half of the year, when we've really been operating with very lean inventories and driving sales volumes really gives us additional confidence that we should be able to operate in these smaller stores and deliver very similar sales levels to what we have in some of our larger boxes. The cost savings come on the occupancy line, but they also come on the rest of the operating expenses in the store, smaller space for utilities, for cleaning, for maintenance so all of those things help the overall performance of the store. And these will become a tailwind as we look to continue to improve our overall operating margins. So we're really excited about the opportunity that we have there. As Michael said, there\u2019s a lot of additional sites that become viable for us in a smaller store format. So we see it as kind of a top line driver as we are able to find more sites and open more stores and the driver of operating margin expansion improvement as we -- we'll be able to have four-wall operating margins at a higher level when we're driving similar sales and a less expensive operation.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Michael, I wanted to follow-up on your comments that you chased over $100 million of sales above plan in December. By my math, this would suggest about a 10 percentage point delta. Is that the right zip code? And do you think that the opportunity to continue chasing and fine-tuning this skill over time will allow you to chase an even larger delta to sales?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning, Kimberly. So, yeah, your math is right. We do approximately -- actually just over $1 billion in December. We came into the fourth quarter, you remember, actually, in November, we were running a comp of minus 10. So that was actually our original plan for the fourth quarter. We saw no reason why that would be better at the time. In fact, in mid-November, people were getting very anxious about the upsurge in COVID-19 cases around the country. So our original plan going into December was minus 10. We -- as you -- correct the math is right, but we ran 10 points above that to hit half of December there. We -- obviously, that requires a lot of work for the planners and the merchants and supply chain to go out there and find out merchandise and flow it to stores and to support sales. And some of that, as you all have heard was moving around reserve releases, which helped us as well. Now in terms of your question of can we chase more than that? I hope we don't have to in some ways, I kind of hope that things settle down a bit. I think in a pre-pandemic world, I would be happy, back a year or two ago, if we had planned a one to two comp and chase to a five. Obviously, the past 12 months has been pretty abnormal. I would hope in a post-pandemic world, as I say things will settle down a little bit. And again, it's going to be very important that we chase and we chase well, but I don't think over the long-term, I expect this kind of volatility. I do for the next 12 months, but once we're out of the next 12 months, I think things should settle down a little bit.\nKimberly Greenberger: We all share that wish I think. My follow-up, Michael, is just on the investments in the buying department. And I think you mentioned that, that is an ongoing investment for 2021. Could you maybe just talk about where those investment dollars are going? Is it going to be broader coverage, more buyers in certain categories? And if you can talk about some of the support that you're giving to your buyers in order to give them greater tools to, I guess, enhance that in-season chase? That would be great.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Yeah, so it's actually all of the above. If I start with the merchants themselves, I would say the growth is -- the growth that we planned, the plan, the three to five-year growth plan that we've developed shows significant headcount growth across all areas of the business. Now there are some differences. So as you'd expect, the areas of our business where we\u2019re, I would say, less penetrated or underpenetrated versus our peers, we're going to invest more in those areas so we can catch up. But the growth is going to happen across the board in all phase of the business and at all levels in terms of levels within the merchant team. So the other very important component is the planning group, similarly, a lot of growth in the planning group to support the merchants and to support growth across different businesses. I called out in my remarks that the growth will be disproportionately high in our New York City buying office and our West Coast buying office. Our New Jersey buying office will also grow, but not to the same degree as New York and California, for the reason I described in my prepared remarks. And then, on your point -- your question about support, I think that's a really good question, because we're also -- we've been putting a lot of thought, and we're going to be putting a lot of investment into supporting our merchant teams. And that support takes a number of different forms, professional development, training, giving the buyers better tools, better visibility into that business, some improvements to our merchandising and planning systems, so we can react more quickly to what we're seeing. And then, also, on the sort of the operating side of things so making sure that the interface between our merchant teams and our supply chain organization works as smoothly as it can, so a lot that we\u2019re doing in that area.\nKimberly Greenberger: Very exciting. Thanks so much.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Kimberly.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a great holiday, and obviously a tough environment. Michael, I want to talk to you, the opportunity here that's so attractive to the investment community. What has been to close the 300 to 400 basis point gap that you have versus the off-price peer group; that was at the 1,000 store target. And I know it's early, and you just told us about 2,000 today, but I'm curious what adding 1,000 stores to the long-term fleet does to that margin target?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Michael. I think I'd anchor my answer to that question by sort of going back to the framework that John Crimmins used a bit earlier, been talking about sort of the margin gap, 'margin gap'. So John outlined three levers to sort of close that margin gap: number one, driving sales and that really means driving comp store sales. And we talked a lot about all the things we're doing to try and drive competitive sales. Secondly, gross margin. And the key element there is really a tighter inventory control and therefore, driving faster turns. And then the third bucket, which is the one that relates most closely to your question, is occupancy costs, where we feel like our stores are bigger, less productive, less peers. And as we cut inventory levels, we've got a jump, an opportunity to move into smaller boxes. So bringing it back to your question, how does the 2,000 stores -- the increase to 2,000 stores help us. It helps us in the sense that it opens up more of those opportunities. It gives us the chance to increase the pace of our new store openings. So, obviously, as we said in the remarks, we're planning 100 gross new stores this year that was net to 75. So that's a lot more than we've opened historically. And opening stores more rapidly like that, gives us the chance to go after that operating cost opportunity more rapidly, if you like. So that's how I would think about it.\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. So, Michael, let me\u2026\nMichael Binetti: Go ahead. John.\nJohn Crimmins: Michael, if I could just add one thing to that. As we consider new store sites, one of our financial hurdles is for the individual store to be accretive to the company's EBIT margin. So, it's kind of built into the way we think about what stores to move forward on. We're very conscious of that operating margin opportunity. So as Michael described, we'll have more of these stores that, almost by definition, that we're going to approve them, should be helping us close the operating margin gap.\nMichael Binetti: Okay. Thanks for that, John. And then if I could just ask one follow-up. Michael, maybe you talk about the journey since you've been here now. John referenced the 2 to 3 points same-store sales leverage point that you guys have always spoken to in the past, and you spoke about the annual cost inflation, natural inflation. I guess the evolution of that 2 to 3 point leverage point is the input to closing that margin gap versus peers. So it was obviously impressive that you sold the same amount \u2013 same revenue and goods this year with 20%, 30% less inventory. So obviously, a lot of progress has been made already. What is the evolution versus when you got here of that 2% to 3% leverage point today? And based on the investments you talked about for this year, where will that be at the end of this year and start looking out to more normal years ahead?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Yes, it's a great question. It's \u2013 I would say the journey over the last \u2013 I've been at Burlington almost 18 months. I would say the journey over the last 18 months has not quite been the journey that I expected that start. The fundamentals haven't changed. The opportunity, actually in my view is now greater than I thought back then. And the strategy we're pursuing is very similar to what we talked about actually a year ago before the pandemic happened. Everything we talked about today, we were talking about a year ago. All that's really happened, I say all that's really happened, it's quite a big thing is we've had this very significant event that's happened over the past 12 months. Now what's that \u2013 what has that done to our journey? Again, it hasn't changed the fundamentals, if anything, I think the opportunity actually looks bigger now, but it's also, in many ways, it's accelerated some of the things that we have talked about. We \u2013 I think it's probably always true that in any business situation, when you're confronted with an unexpected challenge or a severe crisis, and this has been a severe crisis, it forces you to adapt and change at a much faster pace than you otherwise might have. So at the core of Burlington 2.0 is this concept of delivering great value by tightly managing liquidity, chasing sales, buying opportunistically, operating with these inventories. We did all of those things in 2020, especially in the fourth quarter. And because of the circumstances we faced, we had no choice. We had to do those things and actually to do them more so than we would have. I guess, in normal circumstances, I think the progress that we made in 2020 would have taken much longer. Now, I want to sort of temper that a little bit. The fourth quarter is just one quarter. Let's talk again when we wrap up 12 or 16 or 20 quarters, you would still have \u2013 we're not done. We have a lot of work ahead of us. So I think we feel pleased about the progress we've made, but we're humble enough to recognize there's still quite a lot of work ahead of us here.\nMichael Binetti: Thank you so much, guys.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. O'Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to talking to you again in late May to discuss our first quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the fourth quarter, total sales increased 4%, while comparable store sales were flat. The gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points versus last year's rate of 42.1%. This improvement was driven by a 110 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns. This merchandise margin increase more than offset a significant increase in freight expense, which increased 70 basis points over last year's rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs, were $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus $89 million last year, increasing 230 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year. Higher supply chain costs accounted for 180 basis points of this deleverage. This was consistent with the expectations that we discussed in our third quarter call last November. The major drivers were higher wage rates, higher wage incentives, the impact of lower AUR and product mix and inefficiencies caused by safety protocols and the general disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain. The balance of deleverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs. This is consistent with Burlington 2.0 and our strategy of investing in our merchandising capabilities. Adjusted SG&A was $554 million versus $499 million last year, increasing 160 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increases in store-related and corporate costs, including $39 million in COVID-related expenses. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $70 million to $224 million. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.33 versus $3.08 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.44 versus $3.21. During the quarter, the company paid down the $250 million previously outstanding on its ABL facility, ending the fourth quarter with no outstanding balance. We ended the period with available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in unrestricted cash and total balance sheet debt of approximately $1.9 billion. Before I provide our outlook, I wanted to comment on how we are approaching, planning our business and reviewing our performance during this year. As you know, fiscal 2020 was a highly unusual and volatile year, making comparability of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 very difficult. Accordingly, not only are the plans we have developed benchmarked against fiscal 2019, but our comparable store sales results and many of the financial measures we will be reporting in fiscal 2021 will be compared to fiscal 2019 as well. Given the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, we are not prepared at this time to give specific sales or earnings guidance for fiscal 2021. That said, we can provide some guidelines to help you model fiscal 2021. Let's start with sales. As Michael said, for internal planning purposes, we are using a baseline of flat comp in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. In a moment, we will discuss the cost headwinds that we expect to face in fiscal 2021, but before we do that, it's important to call out that as we compare 2021 to 2019, we will have naturally incurred two years of expense growth. Typically on a flat comp, our EBIT margin would decline 20 basis points to 30 basis points on a one year basis or 40 basis points to 60 basis points over two years of expense growth. Staying with sales for a moment, as you think about total sales growth for FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should factor in two years of new stores over that time period, 34 net new stores in fiscal 2020 and 75 planned net new stores in fiscal 2021. Moving on to gross margin, we expect higher freight costs to continue to pressure our reported gross margin in fiscal 2021, but we do expect merchandise margin improvement to offset higher freight costs as we continue to plan our comp store inventories down, which should result in further reduction in our markdown rate. Moving down the P&L, we expect continued cost pressure and deleverage from product sourcing costs in 2021 primarily from higher supply chain costs. We expect significant deleverage versus 2019, driven by similar headwinds to those we experienced in the fourth quarter. In terms of SG&A in FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should also factor in ongoing COVID related SG&A expenses in fiscal 2021. After combining the deleveraging effect of a two year flat comp, the incremental expense pressures that I just outlined, and various offsets and mitigation strategies that we have identified so far, our modeling would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 basis points to 80 basis points, if comp sales are actually flat in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. Again, to be clear, this is based on comp store sales growth being flat on a two year basis. If our comp store sales growth is stronger than this, then we would expect our operating margin performance to be better. Finally, let me share some specific outlook items for your modeling purposes. Net capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $470 million net of landlord allowances. In fiscal 2021, we expect to open 100 new stores, we are closing or relocating 25 stores, resulting in 75 planned net new stores. This includes 18 new stores that were shifted from fiscal 2020 into fiscal 2021.  Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favourable lease cost, is expected to be approximately $260 million. Interest expense, excluding $32 million in non-cash interest on the convertible notes, is expected to be approximately $80 million, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25%. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks. It's a good question. I think maybe the best way to answer, it might be to separate out into two different time periods. First, the period from now until we kind of get through the whole pandemic thing. And then \u2013 that could be maybe the next 12 months. And second, the period after we emerged from the pandemic. So that's probably 2022 and beyond. For that first-time period, maybe up to the next 12 months, hopefully, a little shorter. The sales trend is still going to be really difficult to predict. Traffic into our stores is probably going to continue to be off, the industry-wide supply chain issues that we're seeing are probably going to continue, putting pressure on freight and supply chain expenses and the various COVID related safety measures that we have in our stores and distribution centers will likely need to remain in place for some time. As I said in the prepared remarks, if you combine the deleveraging effect of a two-year flat comp plus the expense pressures in the various offsets that we've identified, this would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 to 80 basis points. If comps store sales are actually flat in 2021 versus 2019. As we said previously, we typically don't expect margin leverage unless we achieve a 2% to 3% comp sales growth in a year. So for 2021, this would require two-year comp growth of 4% to 6% versus 2019. If the recovery from the pandemic were to accelerate over the next few months, and our comp trend were to pick up then we could be back on track, but that all depends on external factors [will be and what] [ph] we can actually control. All right. So, let's switch over and talk about the subsequent time period after the pandemic. At this point, when that's all behind us, we don't see any structural expense changes that would interfere with our longer term margin opportunity. As we've discussed in the past, we see three main drivers of operating margin improvement, of course, the first one is sales; higher sales productivity drives leverage. There are a number of steps that we're taking to drive sales, focusing on [wow] [ph] values, gently controlling liquidity, chasing the sales trend, going after great opportunistic buys and investing in our merchandising capabilities. The second piece would be gross margin. We think we have a significant opportunity to continue to turn our inventories faster than we have historically. And by doing that that's going to drive lower markdowns. I think we demonstrated that pretty well in Q3 and especially in Q4 of 2020 and that gives us a lot of confidence that we have additional opportunity to increase our turns. The third part -- point I'd mention is occupancy costs. Our stores are bigger than less and less productive than our peers. Driving higher sales will help, but as we discussed in our prepared remarks, we also see a significant opportunity to reduce the size of the store, which in turn would reduce occupancy costs in our stores over time. Referring to 2.0, we have specific initiatives in place to go after each of these opportunity areas. Despite all the challenges we faced in 2020, we're really happy with the progress that we made in each of these areas. Most importantly, we remain confident that with good execution, we will drive a significant improvement in operating margin in the next several years once we have the pandemic behind us. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. The product sourcing cost is complicated. So let me kind of explain the way that we think about it. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, product sourcing costs delevered by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter. Higher supply chain costs represented 180 bps of that deleverage. So let's talk about that first. It's probably of use if I break it into a few buckets. First, 90 bps of the supply chain deleverage came from higher wage rates and from wage incentives, similar to what we discussed in the third quarter. The higher wage rates accounted for about half of the 90 bps, and we expect that increase to be permanent. We anticipate that over time, we're likely to find some efficiencies that could partially offset the higher costs; the other half came from the temporary wage rate incentives. These were used to increase staffing when extra work was needed to overcome situational factors, like the receipt flow, volatility that we faced, COVID-related safety measures, of course, we would expect these factors to abate over time. Next bucket to think about includes components of our business during the quarter and how that impacted product sourcing costs and drove some of that deleverage. So in this bucket, I throw a bunch together, I would include AUR, which was down slightly, meaning that we process more units. Category mix, which included a shift toward higher handling cost items like home. And less overall efficiency in our DC processing, resulting partly from the safety protocols and our DCs, but also from the impact of the volatility around timing of receipts and when they were going to arrive at our DCs. We had more goods moving into and out of reserve during the quarter as well, as we reacted to the disruption on those planned receipts and to our stronger than original plan sales trends. So all these factors together drove about 60 bps of the supply chain deleverage. Many of these factors are directly or indirectly related to COVID and the disruption in the global retail supply chain that we've seen and continue to see. But once the pandemic is behind us, we would expect much of this to improve. The last 30 bps of supply chain deleverage was driven by occupancy, where we added some new currently underutilized capacity and deleverage on our fixed cost base at a flat comp. With higher sales and fully utilized warehouse and DC capacity, we would expect leverage on these expenses to improve and drive operating margin expansion in the future. So just to kind of wrap it together, I think the balance of deleverage, the remaining piece of deleverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs, and that's consistent with our growing to strengthening our merchandising capabilities objective. Overtime, we would expect to see continued deleverage as we continue to invest in the team. So to the other part of your question, to the specific dollar amount, we're really staying away from specific dollar amounts, because we really don't know what the sales volume is likely to be we may have to flex up, we may have to flex down. We can't really predict what we're going to do as far as receipt processing capabilities or actual processed dollars of receipt. So I'm going to stay away from anything to do with predicting a fixed dollar amount. But as we discussed, we're going to -- whatever sales trend we see, if it's better or worse, we're going to flex with that. And our variable costs will move in the same direction. So I hope that helps. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Good morning, John. Thanks for your question. So I guess, obviously, there's two areas on our P&L that are impacted by all this stuff, freight and supply chain. And I've already talked quite a bit about in Q4. So, I'll focus a little bit more on the potential impact in 2021. As Michael was describing, these industry-wide supply chain issues haven't gone away. And now that we're in 2021, continues to be huge pressure on the ports, on rail and trucking systems across the country. And, obviously, this has had a significant impact on freight costs. We don't believe at all or even most of this cost pressure is permanent, and we would expect that at some point, supply and demand for freight is going to return to some kind of an equilibrium, but we really don't know when that's going to happen. So our expectation is that we'll be facing similar headwinds to what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we've seen so far this year well into 2021. As I said earlier, talking about gross margin for 2021, we believe that we should be able to cover these higher freight costs through higher merchant margin, driven primarily by the opportunity we see to have lower markdowns again this year. Okay. Let me move on to supply chain costs. The main impact of industry-wide issues on our supply chain is that they create unpredictability in receipt flow. This unpredictability causes inefficiencies in our distribution centers. To deal with the kind of ups and downs, ebbs and flows, we have to add chips and weekends to be staffed whenever the receipts actually do show up in our DCs and are even through to get them out to our stores. This drives up over time and it's driven some of the other wage incentives that we have in place that we talked about. Once the industry-wide situation normalizes, we would expect these expense pressures to go away as well, but again, there's no sign of that happening yet. So these costs could be with us for some time. Just one more comment, and I'm probably just going to echo something that Michael just said. At some point, these industry-wide issues and delays will resolve themselves. And when they do, this could be a really good off-price buying opportunity. So, yes, the situation is driving expense headwinds for us now, but there could be a nice silver lining for us in the future. Yes. Sure, Lorraine. I'll take that question. So as we've kind of described, just operating in a smaller box brings your cost base down. And if we're able to drive the similar sales volume in a smaller box, everything \u2013 all of the costs related to operating in that box are less expensive. So the performance that we've seen over the last \u2013 really, it's been for a couple of years for us, but particularly in the second half of the year, when we've really been operating with very lean inventories and driving sales volumes really gives us additional confidence that we should be able to operate in these smaller stores and deliver very similar sales levels to what we have in some of our larger boxes. The cost savings come on the occupancy line, but they also come on the rest of the operating expenses in the store, smaller space for utilities, for cleaning, for maintenance so all of those things help the overall performance of the store. And these will become a tailwind as we look to continue to improve our overall operating margins. So we're really excited about the opportunity that we have there. As Michael said, there's a lot of additional sites that become viable for us in a smaller store format. So we see it as kind of a top line driver as we are able to find more sites and open more stores and the driver of operating margin expansion improvement as we -- we'll be able to have four-wall operating margins at a higher level when we're driving similar sales and a less expensive operation. Yes. So, Michael, let me... Michael, if I could just add one thing to that. As we consider new store sites, one of our financial hurdles is for the individual store to be accretive to the company's EBIT margin. So, it's kind of built into the way we think about what stores to move forward on. We're very conscious of that operating margin opportunity. So as Michael described, we'll have more of these stores that, almost by definition, that we're going to approve them, should be helping us close the operating margin gap."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's fourth quarter earnings call. We are very glad that you could be with us. We're going to structure this morning's discussion as follows. First, I will review our fourth quarter results; second, I will talk about the outlook for 2021; third, I will discuss the market share opportunities that we see ahead of us; and fourth, I will provide an update on our Burlington 2.0 strategy and key initiatives. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to any questions. I would like to start my review of the fourth quarter by acknowledging our store teams with their strong execution of safety and social distancing protocols in our stores and for providing a safe environment for our associates and our customers in Q4 and indeed, throughout 2020. This attention to safety in our stores was critical to supporting our business. Okay. So let's talk about our results. Comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were flat versus last year. We were down 10% in November, flat in December and up positive 17% in January. I would like to provide some detail on the drivers of this month-by-month comparable store sales performance. As we discussed on the third quarter call, we believe that the weak trend in November was driven by unseasonably warm weather. Given the legacy of our brand and our particular strength in outerwear, our usually warm weather in the fall tends to hurt our traffic and sales more than most other retailers. This was the primary driver of the 10% comp store sales decline for the month. Our sales trend improved significantly in December, as weather normalized, traffic improvement and customers responded to the great merchandise values that they found in our stores. We chased over $100 million of sales above our internal plan in December. We were particularly pleased with this improvement in the sales trend in December, given the external environment. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country meant that we faced lower occupancy limits in many stores and reduced operating hours in some of our major markets. We improved to a flat comp in December despite these limitations.\n\u2013 : Our gross margin in Q4 was up approximately 40 basis points, despite a 70 basis point increase in freight expense. I was very pleased with the 110 basis point increase in our merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower markdowns. Our receipts are fresher. We are turning faster, and we are capturing the margin benefits of these faster inventory terms. The buying environment in the fourth quarter was very favorable, and we were able to finance great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales trend. At year end, our in-store inventory levels were down 16% on a comp store basis. As a reminder, at the same point last year, they were down 15%, on a two year basis, we are operating with significantly less in-store inventory. This is deliberate and consistent with our stated strategy of running our business with much leaner in-store inventory levels. In fact, our in-store inventory turns increased 27% on a comparable basis for Q4, evidence that our strategy is working. Reserve inventory increased to 38% of our total inventory at the end of the fourth quarter versus 33% last year. This would have been higher, but for the fact that we released some of our reserve early. This was merchandise that we had originally planned to release in February that we accelerated into January to support sales and replenish in-store inventory. Of course, this is exactly what reserve inventory is intended for. I would like to turn now to the outlook for 2021. The consumer environment remains very unpredictable. The pace of vaccine rollouts, the spread of virus mutations, the timing of tax refunds and the potential for additional federal stimulus, these are all variables that we have no control over and have very little visibility into. These variables could dramatically impact our sales trend in either direction. As John will discuss later in the call, we have planned and we will be reporting fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2019. This is to avoid a lack of comparability in our fiscal 2020 results. For internal baseline planning purposes, we are assuming a flattish comp for 2021 compared to 2019, but it is important to understand that this is just a baseline. We intend to manage our business very flexibly. If our comp during 2021 is stronger than flat, then as demonstrated in Q4, we have the ability to chase a stronger sales trend. And conversely, of course, we can pull back if that turns out to be necessary. I would like to move on now to talk about the exciting longer term market share opportunities that we see ahead of us. For many years now, long predating the pandemic, the e-commerce and off-price retail sectors have been gaining market share at the expense of department stores. We believe that the aftermath of the pandemic may drive an acceleration of this trend, leading to further consolidation and additional closures of full price bricks-and-mortar retail stores. As we have described before, as these physical stores close, we believe that many shoppers, especially more affluent, time-starved shoppers will migrate more of their spending online, but we anticipate that other shoppers, more value-oriented shoppers will find their way to off-price. With all that said, we recognize that none of the shoppers in our stores cares about our market share, what they care about, as they should, is finding great value on brand, or a style, or an item that they love. Our focus and the central objective of our Burlington 2.0 strategy is to improve our ability to deliver this great merchandise value. I would like to pivot now and offer some updates on Burlington 2.0. As I said earlier, we believe our strong performance relative to our expectations in Q4 was primarily driven by the successful execution of our core Burlington 2.0 strategies, delivering great value to customers by tightly managing liquidity, chasing sales, buying opportunistically, operating lean inventories, getting fresh receipts to the sales floor as fast as possible and flexing our store model based on receipts and traffic. As we move into 2021, we will continue to look for ways to refine and improve our execution of these key strategies. One of the most important long-term enablers of delivering great merchandise value to customers is to invest in our buying and planning capabilities. As I mentioned in our November call, we are pursuing a major multi-year growth plan for our buying and planning organization. We are heavily investing in these capabilities, and we'll be growing this organization at a much faster rate than sales. This expansion will happen across all merchandise categories and in each of our buying offices. The growth will be especially significant in our New York City and our West Coast buying offices. Headcount in both these locations will grow several fold in the next few years. We have very strong vendor relationships today, but we want to further expand and develop these key partnerships. We recognize that, in some cases, having a stronger on the ground presence in New York City and Los Angeles will help us to achieve this. The final update that I would like to provide is on our real estate strategy. As discussed on our November call, our real estate and store operations teams have done a lot of work in the past year on a 25,000 square foot store prototype. We are excited about this prototype. We expect that about a-third of our new store openings in 2021 will be in this format, and that over time, this smaller prototype will grow to represent the majority of our new store openings. Of course, the key enabler of moving to this smaller prototype is to operate with leaner in-store inventory levels. When you have less in-store inventory, you need less physical space. This has significant economic benefits, translating to lower occupancy costs and higher operating margins. The smaller prototype also provides important strategic benefits, increasing the pool of potential real estate sites and providing the opportunity to open profitable stores in more locations around the United States. We are very excited to announce that based on these factors, we are raising our long-term potential store count to 2,000 stores from our previous goal of 1,000 stores. As a reminder, we had 761 stores as we began this fiscal year. So clearly, we have a lot of runway and opportunity ahead of us. Bringing it back to this year, as John will describe in a moment, we plan to open approximately 100 new stores in 2021, while closing or relocating approximately 25 stores for a total increase of 75 net new stores. Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate the pace of newer openings each year. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials. John? Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to thank the entire team at Burlington. It is an understatement to say that we operated in a very difficult environment in 2020. I am proud of how the Burlington organization handled these challenges, and I'm amazed at the progress we made on our strategic priorities.  To express this appreciation, we announced earlier today that we will be paying a special thank-you bonus to the majority of our store, supply chain and corporate office associates, in recognition of their hard work and commitment in 2020. This is a very exciting time for us at Burlington. We are all energized by the significant growth opportunities we see ahead of us and by the strategies we are pursuing to go after these. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Sure. Well, Matt, good morning. Great to hear from you. I guess, there were really two main thoughts behind this baseline. Firstly, I should reiterate, 2021 is a very difficult year to forecast. There are a number of potential positives, the rollout of vaccines and the potential for additional stimulus spending, but there are also some risks and some negatives. The possible spread of additional variants, the continuing high unemployment rate, so a lot of uncertainty.  But with all that uncertainty, we need a baseline that we can plan against, but one that will give us flexibility so we can chase the trend, if our comp growth turns out to be stronger or we can pull back if we need to. Our feeling is that -- by starting with a flattish baseline, we could move it in the direction. So that was the first thought.  The second thought is that our recent trend gives us confidence that this is a good baseline to start with. So let me talk about Q4, and then I'll talk about the quarter to-date. So Q4, obviously, we just reported a flat comp for Q4, but there are a couple of important puts and takes to this number. We know that the federal stimulus checks helped us in January. And conversely, we also know that the unseasonably warm weather really hurt us in November. After adjusting for these specific factors, we estimate that our underlying comp store sales trend in Q4 was down around 1%, so minus 1%. The other data point is our quarter-to-date trend. Now I caution you, we're only, what, 4.5 weeks into a 13-week quarter, but at this point, our quarter-to-date trend is flat. In other words, at this point in the quarter, our trend is consistent with the baseline plan that I've just described. So I guess to summarize it, 2021 is going to be a tough year to forecast. Lots of things that could happen that could help or hurt sales. And what we need to do is to plan our business and be ready to react to a stronger or weaker trend as we did in Q4. And given \u2013 as I said, given the data that we have right now, it feels like a flat comp seems like a reasonable assumption for baseline planning purposes. Good. Yes. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, inventory levels. Let me start with in-store inventories, and then I'll talk about reserve. Our in-store inventory levels, I would say, we're really well-controlled throughout the fourth quarter. On a comp basis, they were down 20% to 30% for most of the quarter. And just think about that for a minute. We did the same comp sales as last year, but we did that with 20% to 30% less inventory in a pandemic. So, operating with leaner inventories is a core element of our Burlington 2.0 strategy. And of course, this faster inventory turn, as John referenced in his remarks, expressed itself in higher merchant margin during the fourth quarter.  At the end of January, our in-store inventory levels were down 16%, but it's important to remember that we began to cut our inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. So this 16% cut was on top of a 15% reduction at the end of January 2019. In other words, we're now operating with much lower inventory levels than we have historically. You'd expect that we will continue to manage our in-store inventory levels slightly going forward. There will be variations depending on the quarter and the time of year. Overall, I would say that inventory level \u2013 in-store inventory levels will be down double-digits throughout 2021 compared to 2019. Let me move on to reserve inventory. Our reserve was 5% higher at the end of Q4, but that statistic doesn't really capture all the movement in and out of reserve during the quarter. In fact, our January reserve receipts, so the goods that were coming into reserve in January were actually up 42% versus last year. So what happened, of course, is that our reserve releases were up even more. They were up 62% versus last year. So reserve release has been good. So they came out of the reserve. In order to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales, we accelerated those releases from reserve. In other words, merchandise that we had planned to release to stores in February or even early March, we pulled up to support our very strong sales trend in January and to replenish our in-store inventory levels. As I said, in my earlier remarks, this is exactly what reserve inventory is intended for. We see reserve as a very important tool that our merchants can use to chase sales and take advantage of great deals in the market. But with that said, that does make it difficult to forecast what reserve inventory levels are likely to be at the end of each quarter. Reserve inventory balances could move up or down in 2021 depending upon those two things. Our sales trend versus plan and the availability of great opportunistic buys that we want to pack away.  Let me finish up the last part of your question, availability. Overall, I would say that we were very happy with availability in the fourth quarter. Our merchants were able to buy terrific merchandise at great values to support our ahead-of-plan sales in the quarter and to transition our assortment to spring. So we're very pleased with the merchandise we have in our stores right now. Thanks, Ike. Good morning, John. It's actually a really good question. Let me do this. I'll provide some high-level commentary on what we're seeing in the industry and how we're working around those issues. And then I'll ask John Crimmins to talk about the financial impact. So the supply chain issues across the retail industry, I would say, over the last several months have been extraordinary. The magnitude of the bottlenecks, the congestion and the delays in getting merchandise into the country, and then moving it around the country, I would characterize all of this as unprecedented. It's not difficult to understand why this has happened. For a good chunk of last year, industry supply chains slowed down or completely shut out in some cases. And then for several months after stores reopened, retailers and vendors were understandably cautious. They didn't know what was going to happen. And then, all of a sudden, in the fourth quarter, there was a rush to bring in merchandise the holiday, and then more recently at the spring. You add to all of that, the ports, the major transportation hubs and the vendor's warehouses have struggled to operate at normal capacity because of COVID-related precautions or because of staffing issues. A few months ago, I would have said, but the situation would solidly correct itself once we got through holiday, that did not happen. There are still very, very significant industry delays coming through the ports, the transportation hubs and our vendor warehouses. And if you cope with these issues, we've had to juggle the timing of purchase orders, reserve releases and inbound CECO. I feel like we live through a version of this last summer, and we learned some important lessons. It's been very challenging. But I would say our buying, planning and supply chain teams have really been able to stay on top of that. And we've been able to get the seats that we need to support our sales trend. Even though we've been able to manage through these issues, there's clearly a financial impact in terms of higher freight rates and supply chain expenses. And in a moment, I'll let John provide more detail on how those might impact us in 2021. But before I hand off to John, let me make one final point. Usually, these situations, where merchandise orders are disruptive or delayed, usually, these situations end up expressing themselves in terms of increased off-price supply. Once these issues unwind, and of course, they will unwind, but maybe not for a little while, we think this could be a very, very good off-price buying opportunity. Okay. I'll let John Crimmins talk about the financial impact. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thank you for the question. We've done a lot of work on this topic over the last 12 months, and we're very excited about this opportunity. As you know, our previous target of 1,000 stores have been in place for a while, but that estimate is pretty dated. It was based on a set of assumptions around store prototype; store economics and market share opportunity that really no longer apply. Let's start with the store prototype. As we talked before, we're introducing a new smaller 25,000 square foot store prototype, real estate; merchandise planning and store operations teams have collaborated. They've done some really great work to develop detailed operating plans for this prototype. Over the next couple of years, we expect that this smaller format will become a central element in our new store opening plans. And as I described in my remarks, the key enabler of moving to this smaller format is to operate with leaner in-store inventory levels, which is obviously a core element of Burlington 2.0. The smaller store prototype, not surprisingly, has some significant economic benefits, and John referenced this in his remarks, the smaller footprint drives lower occupancy costs. And of course, this means higher operating margins. The smaller footprint also means improved real estate availability for new stores and relocations. We worked with a specialist, third-party analytics firm to analyze the information on our new store prototype, together with data on the demographics of our target customers. We then combined that analysis with what we're seeing in the marketplace in terms of retail real estate opportunities. The updated store count potential that we announced today is based upon all of that detailed modeling. The final point to make, though, is that with this kind of exercise, with this kind of modeling, it's important to do a reality check. Is this opportunity real? Is there enough market share opportunity to support 2,000 Burlington stores? So in addition to the detailed modeling that I've just described, we looked very closely at how retail market share might evolve over the next several years. What will happen to the share of department stores, specialty stores and more based retailers. Of course, we also looked at how successful e-commerce is likely to be in penetrating the categories that we compete in at the price points we offer and with the customer segments that we serve. The bottom-line from all of this analysis is that we feel very confident about the market share opportunity that we have ahead of us and very confident about our potential to get to 2,000 Burlington stores. Good morning, Kimberly. So, yeah, your math is right. We do approximately -- actually just over $1 billion in December. We came into the fourth quarter, you remember, actually, in November, we were running a comp of minus 10. So that was actually our original plan for the fourth quarter. We saw no reason why that would be better at the time. In fact, in mid-November, people were getting very anxious about the upsurge in COVID-19 cases around the country. So our original plan going into December was minus 10. We -- as you -- correct the math is right, but we ran 10 points above that to hit half of December there. We -- obviously, that requires a lot of work for the planners and the merchants and supply chain to go out there and find out merchandise and flow it to stores and to support sales. And some of that, as you all have heard was moving around reserve releases, which helped us as well. Now in terms of your question of can we chase more than that? I hope we don't have to in some ways, I kind of hope that things settle down a bit. I think in a pre-pandemic world, I would be happy, back a year or two ago, if we had planned a one to two comp and chase to a five. Obviously, the past 12 months has been pretty abnormal. I would hope in a post-pandemic world, as I say things will settle down a little bit. And again, it's going to be very important that we chase and we chase well, but I don't think over the long-term, I expect this kind of volatility. I do for the next 12 months, but once we're out of the next 12 months, I think things should settle down a little bit. Sure. Yeah, so it's actually all of the above. If I start with the merchants themselves, I would say the growth is -- the growth that we planned, the plan, the three to five-year growth plan that we've developed shows significant headcount growth across all areas of the business. Now there are some differences. So as you'd expect, the areas of our business where we're, I would say, less penetrated or underpenetrated versus our peers, we're going to invest more in those areas so we can catch up. But the growth is going to happen across the board in all phase of the business and at all levels in terms of levels within the merchant team. So the other very important component is the planning group, similarly, a lot of growth in the planning group to support the merchants and to support growth across different businesses. I called out in my remarks that the growth will be disproportionately high in our New York City buying office and our West Coast buying office. Our New Jersey buying office will also grow, but not to the same degree as New York and California, for the reason I described in my prepared remarks. And then, on your point -- your question about support, I think that's a really good question, because we're also -- we've been putting a lot of thought, and we're going to be putting a lot of investment into supporting our merchant teams. And that support takes a number of different forms, professional development, training, giving the buyers better tools, better visibility into that business, some improvements to our merchandising and planning systems, so we can react more quickly to what we're seeing. And then, also, on the sort of the operating side of things so making sure that the interface between our merchant teams and our supply chain organization works as smoothly as it can, so a lot that we're doing in that area. Thanks, Kimberly. Sure. Well, good morning, Michael. I think I'd anchor my answer to that question by sort of going back to the framework that John Crimmins used a bit earlier, been talking about sort of the margin gap, 'margin gap'. So John outlined three levers to sort of close that margin gap: number one, driving sales and that really means driving comp store sales. And we talked a lot about all the things we're doing to try and drive competitive sales. Secondly, gross margin. And the key element there is really a tighter inventory control and therefore, driving faster turns. And then the third bucket, which is the one that relates most closely to your question, is occupancy costs, where we feel like our stores are bigger, less productive, less peers. And as we cut inventory levels, we've got a jump, an opportunity to move into smaller boxes. So bringing it back to your question, how does the 2,000 stores -- the increase to 2,000 stores help us. It helps us in the sense that it opens up more of those opportunities. It gives us the chance to increase the pace of our new store openings. So, obviously, as we said in the remarks, we're planning 100 gross new stores this year that was net to 75. So that's a lot more than we've opened historically. And opening stores more rapidly like that, gives us the chance to go after that operating cost opportunity more rapidly, if you like. So that's how I would think about it. Sure. Yes, it's a great question. It's \u2013 I would say the journey over the last \u2013 I've been at Burlington almost 18 months. I would say the journey over the last 18 months has not quite been the journey that I expected that start. The fundamentals haven't changed. The opportunity, actually in my view is now greater than I thought back then. And the strategy we're pursuing is very similar to what we talked about actually a year ago before the pandemic happened. Everything we talked about today, we were talking about a year ago. All that's really happened, I say all that's really happened, it's quite a big thing is we've had this very significant event that's happened over the past 12 months. Now what's that \u2013 what has that done to our journey? Again, it hasn't changed the fundamentals, if anything, I think the opportunity actually looks bigger now, but it's also, in many ways, it's accelerated some of the things that we have talked about. We \u2013 I think it's probably always true that in any business situation, when you're confronted with an unexpected challenge or a severe crisis, and this has been a severe crisis, it forces you to adapt and change at a much faster pace than you otherwise might have. So at the core of Burlington 2.0 is this concept of delivering great value by tightly managing liquidity, chasing sales, buying opportunistically, operating with these inventories. We did all of those things in 2020, especially in the fourth quarter. And because of the circumstances we faced, we had no choice. We had to do those things and actually to do them more so than we would have. I guess, in normal circumstances, I think the progress that we made in 2020 would have taken much longer. Now, I want to sort of temper that a little bit. The fourth quarter is just one quarter. Let's talk again when we wrap up 12 or 16 or 20 quarters, you would still have \u2013 we're not done. We have a lot of work ahead of us. So I think we feel pleased about the progress we've made, but we're humble enough to recognize there's still quite a lot of work ahead of us here. Thanks. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to talking to you again in late May to discuss our first quarter results. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's third quarter earnings call. We are very glad that you could be with us. We are going to structure this morning's discussion as follows: First, review our third quarter results; Second, I will talk about the outlook for Q4; Third, I will describe how we are thinking about the post-pandemic world and what actions we are taking to prepare for it. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay. Let's start with the third quarter. Our comparable store sales performance in the third quarter exceeded our expectations at down 11% versus last year. I think, it is important to breakdown this comp performance in more detail than we normally would. As we came into the quarter, the trend was very weak and comp store sales for August ended down more than 20%. The weak trend in August was driven by two main factors. Firstly, as we came into the third quarter, our in-store inventory position was well below where we wanted it to be. We discussed the underlying reasons for this in our second quarter earnings call. It was not until the end of August that in-store inventories reached planned levels. Secondly, back-to-school is typically the dominant driver of traffic into our stores in early Q3. This traffic did not materialize in August, and for a awhile, we did not know, if back-to-school would happen at all. Once we go through August, both of these factors turned around. By early September, our in-store inventory levels had recovered and the back-to-school traffic that we had expected in August finally showed up in September. Our baseline plan for Q3 had been minus 20% comp, but in September and October, we chased the trend to minus 4% comp for the combined two-month period. Our gross margin in Q3 was up approximately 260 basis points. This was driven by higher markup and by lower markdowns. The buying environment in Q2 and Q3 was very strong, and our merchants took advantage of great opportunistic deals. These deals allowed us to successfully pass along terrific value to the customer. We were pleased with our Q3 markup performance, but we do not believe that this higher markup is sustainable. As the buying environment normalizes, our goal will be to continue to use opportunistic buying to offer great value and thereby drive sales. But we do not expect to capture higher markup as a normal course of business. The other key driver of our improved gross margin was a faster inventory turn and lower markdowns. Again, there were certain aspects of Q3 that were very unusual and that contributed to this improvement. We do not expect to achieve a similar level of markdown improvement in the fourth quarter. I would like to turn now to the sales outlook for the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the environment remains very unpredictable. In fact, the situation across the country with COVID-19 appears to be deteriorating. This is happening at the worst possible time for retail. The fourth quarter has gotten off to a weak start, with November month-to-date comp running down in the low double digits. Our assessment is that this initial weak trend has been driven by unseasonably warm weather, rather than by COVID. Typically, we would expect this impact to turn around later in the quarter. But there is risk that by then the resurgence in COVID-19 cases may have undermined an already fragile trend. Candidly, we just don't know. But, again, just like Q3, we need to be prepared for a wide range of possible outcomes. We are tightly controlling our inventories and liquidity. We will remain very flexible, either to pull back or to chase the sales trend. Together with everyone else on this call, we have been following the positive news on potential vaccines with great interest. This positive news suggests that the end of the pandemic is within sight. But realistically, this probably means that it will be the second half of 2021 before the retail environment starts to feel normal again. I would like to use the next few minutes to talk about how we are thinking about the post-pandemic world and more importantly what actions we are taking to prepare for it. As I have discussed on previous calls, in some important respects, we do not think that once we get through the pandemic, the world will just revert to the way it was. Our view is that the aftermath of the pandemic will lead to an acceleration in a couple of very important trends, trends that have been evident for some time. Firstly, the consumer desire and need for value; and secondly, the growth of e-commerce at the expense of full-price bricks-and-mortar retailers. We expect these trends to drive further rationalization of full-price bricks-and-mortar retail over the next several years. As these physical stores close, we expect that some shoppers, especially more affluent time-stopped shoppers will migrate more of their spending online. But we anticipate that other shoppers, value-oriented shoppers, will find their way to off-price. This is consistent with what has actually been happening over the last several years. E-commerce has been growing rapidly and bricks-and-mortar off-price retail has been growing in parallel. In the categories where we compete and at the low-price points that we offer, e-commerce is much less effective or competitive in meeting the needs of value-oriented shoppers. As the store closings that I have described play out, there will be an opportunity for bricks-and-mortar off-price retail to gain significant share. Our priority at Burlington as the smallest, least developed and least profitable of the major off-price retailers, is to position ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity. We have talked in the past about Burlington 2.0, our off-price full potential strategy. The core objective of Burlington 2.0 is to significantly improve how we execute the off-price model. I would like to use our Q3 results to describe some of the ways in which Burlington 2.0 is already having an impact on the business. To be clear, no one at Burlington will ever be happy with a decline in comp store sales, but there were some positive aspects of this performance to call out, number one, in the summer, our merchants did a great job going after tremendous opportunistic buys. As these receipts finally arrived in stores, they ignited the sales trend in early September. Number two, we then chased this sales trend. We controlled and channeled our liquidity to go after the strongest merchandise categories and to shift the assortment. The overriding focus was on offering wow value.  Number three, in our supply chain and in our stores, we put huge emphasis and urgency on getting the fresh receipts through the system and out to the sales floor. This worked despite significant ahead-of-plan sales, in-store inventories came in almost exactly on plan at the end of Q3. Number four, we managed these inventory levels deliberately and conservatively, driving the ahead-of-plan sales through a faster turn and thereby driving lower markdowns. Overall, I am pleased with these aspects of our performance. I see them as early signs of progress with Burlington 2.0. We can and we will get better. This improved execution of the off-price model will be very important as we position ourselves for the post-pandemic world and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. The things that I have just talked about, much greater focus on value, tighter liquidity control, lower inventories and more urgency in receipt flow, as I've described, these are already important and growing aspects of how we are managing the business. But there are other aspects of Burlington 2.0 that are at a much earlier stage of development or implementation. I would like to share some high-level updates on three of these, marketing; merchandising; and our store prototype. First of all, marketing. Our marketing team has done some great work this year looking at how we can communicate a stronger, much more direct off-price value message and how we can deliver this communication in a more targeted and cost-effective way. We will start to roll out these changes in Q4. We believe that this new marketing program will help to leverage our marketing reach and spend in the years ahead. Secondly, our merchandising organization. As we have discussed in the past, we believe that the key enabler of better executing the off-price model and driving growth in our business is to invest in our merchandising capabilities. I am very excited about the organizational growth plan that we have developed for our buying and planning group. It involves a combination of external hires and very importantly, the development and promotion of internal talent. In terms of external hires, we are pleased and somewhat surprised at the number and the quality of candidates that we have successfully interviewed, hired and on-boarded this year, despite the pandemic. We are also excited about the pipeline of external candidates. There are two factors that are helping us. The pandemic itself is obviously causing major disruption in the retail industry. This is freeing up some terrific merchandising talent and experience. Secondly, we have an extremely compelling story. As the smallest of the major off-price retailers, we have a lot of growth ahead of us. In many merchandising categories, the Company is at a relatively early stage of its development. And talented merchants and planners who join our team now have a great opportunity to participate in our growth, and at the same time, drive their own personal and professional development in the years to come. The other critical aspect of our organizational growth plan is the development of internal talent, growing our own. We have a lot of high potential talent in our merchandising and planning organization. I am excited to see this talent grow and take on more responsibility. Internal promotions are a key part of our organizational plan. We have stepped up our training and development programs this year, and we have plans to do much more over the next few years. The third aspect of Burlington 2.0 that I would like to update you on is our store prototype. As we have discussed in the past, we believe that we have an opportunity to significantly improve store level productivity and economics by further reducing the size of our stores. Our real estate and store operations teams have done a lot of work in the past year on a 25,000 square-foot store prototype. We feel good about the merchandising and operational plans that we have developed for this smaller prototype. We expect the economics of this format to be very favorable, and we anticipate that it will become a central part of our new store opening and relocation programs, especially from 2022 onwards. We will be finalizing these plans over the next several months, and we expect to have more details to share with you in our fourth quarter earnings call in March 2021. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the third quarter, total sales decreased 6%, while comparable store sales decreased 11%. As Michael described earlier, our comparable store sales improved significantly after our inventories recovered to more appropriate levels at the end of August. We believe this improvement was driven by our improved inventory position, the delay in back-to-school purchases, and the outstanding values offered to our customers from the great merchandise buys we were able to deliver in Q3. The gross margin rate was 45.0%, an increase of 260 basis points versus last year's rate of 42.4%. This improvement was primarily driven by lower markdowns and higher markup, which were partially offset by increased freight costs. We do not expect to be able to generate the same level of year-over-year gross margin improvement in Q4 that we were able to achieve in Q3. There are two reasons for this. First, while our clearance levels are down versus last year at the end of Q3, clearance inventory entering Q3 was extraordinarily low due to our aggressive Q2 clearance strategy. That significantly reduced our clearance markdowns in August, which we don't believe is repeatable in Q4. Second, while we significantly exceeded our planned sales in Q3, sales for Q4 remained very uncertain due to the impact of the pandemic, which would affect our inventory and markdown levels, depending on how sales play out during the holiday season. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs, were $144 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90 million last year, increasing 360 basis points as a percentage of sales. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we had expected significant deleverage in product sourcing cost for the third quarter for a number of reasons. Like most other retailers, we struggled at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter as we tried to get our DCs fully staffed and operating effectively. We prioritized inventory flow over cost efficiencies during the quarter as our teams work to get inventory back to appropriate levels in our stores and then to chase the positive trends we were seeing as we experienced sales well above our planned levels during the quarter. Supply chain costs caused 280 basis points of the product sourcing cost deleverage. About 100 basis points or $16 million of this deleverage was driven by temporary COVID-related costs, which include recruiting expenses and incentives we put in place as we work to get our DC teams back to full strength. Wage rate increases since last year drove another 70 basis points of deleverage. The balance of supply chain deleverage was driven by 4 additional factors: Occupancy costs, as we added additional storage and processing space that is not yet fully utilized; A decrease in AUR; Changes in product mix; And a disproportionate increase in receipt volume processed as we work to catch up on rebuilding our inventories. The remaining deleverage in product sourcing costs came from buying costs as we lost sales leverage on the fixed cost base of our merchandising organization while continuing to invest in improving our merchandising capabilities. We do expect continued significant deleverage in product sourcing cost in the fourth quarter, though we could see some modest improvement in rate even at similar sales volumes as the DC recruiting and temporary incentive costs will be behind us. The best way to think about modeling product sourcing costs for the fourth quarter is to assume a similar dollar level of product sourcing costs to what we incurred in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $495 million versus $486 million last year, increasing 240 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increases in store-related and corporate costs, including $20 million in COVID-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing expense. As the pandemic continues and seems likely to worsen during the fourth quarter, we will continue to plan our business and our inventory levels conservatively and adjust to the trends we see. While our SG&A expense will flex with our sales volume, we could see continued SG&A deleverage in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBIT decreased $81 million to $59 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by the lower sales volume and increased product sourcing costs. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter. We have $348 million remaining on our share repurchase program, which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.12 versus income of $1.44 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.29 versus a profit of $1.53 per share last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.3 billion in cash, $250 million in borrowings on our ABL, $958 million on our senior secured term loan facility, base value of $805 million in convertible notes and $300 million in senior secured notes. We had unused ABL availability of approximately $292 million. We ended the period with total balance sheet debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Merchandise inventories were $867 million versus $1,004 million last year, a 14% decrease. In the last few months, we have made an adjustment to how we classify our merchandise inventories. This reclassification is intended to better reflect our strategy to drive faster turns of in-store inventories, while at the same time taking advantage of great opportunistic buys that will be stored for later release. Using this updated classification, our merchandise inventories at the end of Q3 broke down as follows. First of all, in-store inventories. This includes inventory that is in our stores, on its way to stores or being processed at the DC to be sent to stores. These inventories were down about 20% on a comp store basis at the end of Q3. This was in line with our plan of down 20% to 25% versus last year. Secondly, reserve inventories. This includes all inventory that is being stored for later release, either later in the season or in a subsequent season. This reserve inventory was up 8% at the end of Q3. It represented 25% of total inventory at the end of Q3 compared to 19% last year. I'll talk more about this in a moment. During the quarter, we opened 30 net new stores, bringing our total store count at the end of the third quarter to 769 stores. This included 30 new store openings and 7 relocations. In the fourth quarter, we do not expect to open any new stores, but do expect to close 8 stores, resulting in an expected fiscal year-end store count of 761 stores. As compared to our outlook on our last earnings call, we still will open 62 new stores in fiscal 2020, but we decided to close 2 additional stores. As discussed in the last earnings call, we still expect to open the 18 new stores in fiscal 2021 that were shifted from opening in fiscal 2020. We will have more to say on our 2021 expected new store openings as well as our broader real estate strategy over the next several years on our fourth quarter call in March. Net capital expenditures were $188 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $245 million for fiscal 2020. Now, I will turn to some comments on our outlook. As described earlier, the sales trend for the fourth quarter is very difficult to forecast. Our month-to-date comp for November is down low double digits. We believe that this month-to-date trend has been negatively affected by the warmer year-over-year temperatures. But even once the weather turns around, the range of possible outcomes for the remainder of the fourth quarter is very wide. It is possible that the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and actions and restrictions taken by government authorities in response could have a significant negative impact on the trend. Given this uncertainty, we will not be issuing formal sales and earnings guidance again this quarter. We continue to plan the business conservatively, keeping tight control over liquidity, inventory and expenses. This posture gives us the flexibility from a liquidity and open-to-buy standpoint to flex up our receipts and opportunistic purchases if we see a stronger sales trend than expected. We were able to demonstrate that ability as we flexed up our receipts to chase September and October sales, and we will take that same flexible approach to planning and reacting to what we see in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, if trends are below expectations, we'll have the flexibility and liquidity to pull back on our purchases, if necessary. As I explained a moment ago, our in-store inventories at the end of Q3 were down about 20% on a comp store basis, which was in line with plan. During the fourth quarter, we will continue to manage in-store inventories conservatively versus last year. In contrast, we expect to significantly increase our reserve inventory. At the end of Q3, this inventory was up 8% versus last year. This increase would have been more significant, but for the fact that we deliberately push some of our reserve inventory purchases from Q3 into Q4. We did this for two reasons. First, to free up supply chain capacity for current and holiday merchandise. And second, because we believe that the buying environment for this merchandise could be even more attractive in the fourth quarter. If this turns out to be correct, then we estimate that reserve inventory by the end of January could be up more than 50% compared to last year. Finally, as we did last quarter, we can update you on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items that may be useful for modeling purposes. Capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances, are now expected to be approximately $245 million. We expect to open 62 new stores, but now anticipate relocating or closing 28 stores for a revised total of 34 net new stores in fiscal 2020. Previously, we had expected to close or relocate 26 stores. Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favorable lease costs, is now expected to be approximately $225 million. And interest expense, excluding $24 million in noncash interest on the convertible notes, is now expected to be approximately $75 million. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to express my warm appreciation and gratitude to all our associates at Burlington. We continue to operate in the midst of a global health crisis, which is likely to continue to impact our lives in the months ahead. This is a challenging time, but it is also a very exciting time at the Company. There are a lot of very good things happening. The way that our associates have mobilized behind Burlington 2.0 has been particularly impressive and further reinforces my belief and confidence in our prospects over the next several years. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss of JP Morgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks, and congrats on the improvement. Michael, maybe any additional color that you can provide on the components of comp store sales in the quarter, traffic, basket size, average unit retail? I think, it would be very helpful if you could add any color.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. I'm going to start by reading the actual data, and then I'll provide some editorial commentary. So, let's see. Traffic for the quarter was off by more than 20%. Our average basket size in units was up by more than 20%. Our average unit retail, so the average price per unit, was down about 10%. If you combine those items, the average transaction size in dollars was higher by about 10%, low double digits. And if you mix all of those variables together, of course, you get minus 11% comp decline for the quarter. So, that's the data. Let me sort of offer up some conclusions that I would draw from this data. The first point I would make is that the decline in traffic versus last year is disappointing. It improved as we came out of August, but it was still weak in September and October. I think, there are really two factors that drove that weakness. First, most obviously, if you like, we're in a pandemic. There are shoppers who just are not going to be comfortable coming back into a bricks and mortar environment until we get through this. We have very robust safety and social distancing programs in our stores, and we've marketed these. But we realized that despite those measures, realistically, traffic is going to remain depressed until we get through the pandemic. So, that's the point number one. Point number two, I think we have to acknowledge that compared with our peers, we at Burlington, we're not necessarily a top-of-mind destination for some of the key merchandise categories that shoppers are most interested in right now. As I'll describe in a moment, we've made huge progress in areas like home and casual apparel. But we recognize that in these businesses, we are starting from further behind versus peers. The second conclusion that I would draw from the data though is much more positive. And it's that I think we are doing -- I think, we're doing an excellent job driving business with the traffic that is coming into our stores. We've shifted our assortment and we're offering great values, actually great values in many of the same categories that I just mentioned, categories that the customer wants to buy right now. We've significantly expanded our home, active, casual, essentials and basics merchandise assortments. This enabled us to chase the trend in September and October. Now, I think, you can actually see the stronger value in the lower AUR. And the higher basket size shows that the customers that are coming into the store are responding very well. They're buying many more items, and they're spending more during each visit. So, I think, these are encouraging indicators, encouraging indicators of what might happen if and when traffic levels pick up, once we get through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMatthew Boss: That's helpful. And then, as a follow-up. On the industry supply chain, so on the August call, you talked about delivery delays from vendors and how these then impacted your in-store inventory. I'm curious where we stand today and if these delays have dissipated.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Yes, it's a good question. That was a big part of the story on our last call. Let me chunk out my answer a little bit. I'll start with an update on our own internal supply chain, our own distribution centers. You'll recall that in August, we explained that along with many other retailers, we'd run into significant staffing issues in our distribution centers and that those issues had really hampered our ability to get in-store inventories up to planned levels as fast as we would have liked. The simple update here is that those issues have been resolved. In Q3, we took a number of actions, including higher wage rates and on-boarding incentives. And these actions worked. We've been very happy with how our distribution centers have been able to ramp up for peak holiday production in October and November month-to-date. And right now, obviously, we're at that peak processing level. So, that's the update on our own internal supply chain. But, the broader sort of industry-wide issues has not gone away. There are chronic delays in merchandise deliveries across the retail industry. I'm sure that you've heard this elsewhere. These delays are being driven by, I would say, a number of factors, including ongoing staffing issues at vendor distribution facilities, timing issues kind of associated with the surge of orders that took place following the lockdown earlier this year. And then, I would also say import delays, specifically related to congestion at the West Coast ports. Now, we took a number of steps in the third quarter to sort of navigate our way around these issues. Remember, we've seen this movie before in Q2. So, we were aware of the risks. Our planners and buyers, I think, did a very good job juggling purchase orders and delivery dates. So, at the end of the third quarter, our in-store inventory levels were pretty much right on plan, but down 20% on a comp store basis. The last point I would make is just stepping back, and Matt, I'm sure you realize this. There is potentially a very important silver lining in the delays I've just described. In the coming weeks, these delivery delays across the industry are likely to translate into off-price supply. This could become an attractive off-price buying opportunity. And that's actually one of the reasons why we pushed some of our reserve inventory purchases to later in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the information. That was super helpful. I guess a couple of questions. The first one is about if we could talk about the operating margins. I guess it sounds like there's aspects to the Burlington 2.0 that should help drive margins higher over time, but I think there's also some expense headwinds. You guys are alluding to supply chain and product sourcing cost sounded like a big one that can offset some of these gains, especially in the near term. Just how should we think about the different factors and their impacts on margins? And then, I have a follow-up after that.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Ike. Good to hear from you. I think, I'll break down the question into two different time periods. In the short term, what are our expectations for operating margins, specifically in 2021? In a moment, I'm going to ask John to address that. But first, let me talk about the longer term, what is the operating margin opportunity for Burlington over the next several years? Internally, as we've modeled the impact of Burlington 2.0, we've identified and sort of zeroed in on three main drivers of margin improvement. And, we believe that these three drivers represent the lion's share of the margin gap versus our peers. The first is sales. Of course, the higher sales, productivity drives leverage. The steps that we're taking to drive sales are the things that we've talked about, in particular, controlling our liquidity so we can chase trends and take advantage of opportunistic buys and heavily investing in merchandising capabilities, so we can deliver even stronger value across all categories and in particular, develop under penetrated categories. That's the first lever. The second lever is gross margin. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to turn our inventories faster than we have historically and thereby drive lower markdowns. One aspect of this, of course is as I've just mentioned, to drive higher sales, but the other critical enabler is tight control of inventory levels and also greater urgency in getting fresh receipts to the sales floor. If we do those things, I'm actually very confident we can drive faster inventory turns and significantly lower markdowns, and I kind of feel like we demonstrated that to some degree in the third quarter. The third driver of margin improvement is lower occupancy costs. Our stores are bigger and less productive than our peers. Again, driving higher sales will help. But, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe we have an opportunity to reduce the size of our store prototype, thereby reducing our occupancy expenses over time. Now, as part of Burlington 2.0, we have specific initiatives in place to go after each of the levers I've just described. Over the next several years, we expect, I expect to make significant progress in driving improvements in our operating margin. But that said, these things never necessarily work in a straight line. There are going to be short-term headwinds. And certainly, until we get through the pandemic, there will be challenges, either from deleverage on lower sales volumes or higher operating expenses, such as supply chain or COVID-related costs. On our fourth quarter call in March, we'll provide an updated view on these headwinds for 2021, but it might make sense. But now, maybe for John to provide some initial comments on what we think we may face next year.\nJohn Crimmins: Sure. Thanks, Michael, and good morning, Ike. Obviously, we still got a lot of work to do on our plan for next year. But I think we can share a little color kind of how we're thinking about it as we put it together this year. Usually, when we start to build an annual plan, we're going to set objectives based on what we want to achieve compared to the current year. But since 2020 has been such a unique unusual year, we're going to look back to 2019 as the base year for our 2021 plan. So, we'll focus on how 2021 is going to differ from 2019. Again, normally, one of the first assumptions that you'd lock in on would be comp sales growth. But we still have the pandemic going on. It seems to be getting worse before it's likely to get better. We're optimistic that there may be an end in sight. But yes, it's going to continue to impact all of retail, and that's going to make -- sales is likely going to be a little bit of a roller coaster as it's been this year. So, this means we're going to have to plan conservatively and then we're going to look to flex to the business trends that as we see them develop. Now, the good news on that is we've had some pretty good practice at doing that this year. So, that means we're going to have conservative comp assumptions. Whenever you have conservative comp assumptions, it's going to be difficult to drive operating margin expansion. And it's going to be even more difficult in 2021 because we're building a plan from a base year of 2019. So, if you think about it, we will have experienced two years of fixed expense inflation increases. So, ignoring any other cost headwinds, we'd have to cover that with adequate sales growth before we begin to see our normal expense leverage. And while we do expect some of the temporary COVID-related expenses to end when the pandemic ends, we could see that we will have some headwinds that are still going to be there. So, what we can see now, we've seen supply chain wage pressures that we had to respond to in this year. And we've seen a lower AUR trend, as we -- Michael just talked about for what we've seen in the third quarter. We do expect the lower AUR to drive sales, as Michael described. But it also means that there is more units to process per dollar of sales. While we're confident that over time we can mitigate these expense pressures, we've got a history of kind of always been able to figure that out. But, some of our mitigating actions, like reengineering production processes or automating others are going to take a little longer. They're going to have some lead time. So again, compared to 2019, we're expecting to see pretty significant deleverage of supply chain expenses in 2021. As I said a moment ago, we still have a lot of work to do over the next few months. And we're going to be in a much better position to share more detail on our sales and our expense plans during our March call.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. And then, just one quick follow-up on AUR. I think, you guys talked about lower AUR in the quarters. Can you help -- can you expand on that a little bit? It sounds like you expect this to continue into '21. Just a little bit more detail on that topic would be great.\nJohn Crimmins: Sure, Ike. Yes. First, let me kind of talk about what we saw in the third quarter a little bit in AUR. Yes. I think that the biggest driver of this, our mix of merchandise. Consumers are interested in different things now than they were prior to the pandemic. Our strongest merchandise category is right now things like casual, apparel, active, athletic, basics, essentials, palm merchandise, all the ones that you think of when people are not back to their normal lives. On average, these have a lower AUR than the merchandise categories that haven't been as strong. So, we kind of traded off sales in these lower AUR categories, and we're not -- we're seeing not as strong sales in things like career where structured apparel, tailored clothing, the more dressy categories. And in general, more dressy tends to means higher price; and in general, less dressy tends to mean lower price. So that's one of the drivers. The second driver would be our pricing. We've been working across all our merchandise categories to have sharper, more competitive pricing. As Michael has been talking about, we believe that in off-price, the most effective way to drive sales is to offer the best possible merchandise value. That's what the customer really cares about. The last couple of quarters, that's what our merchants have been focused on, offering great value, and it's been working. As Michael mentioned, the number of units per basket rose by more than 20% in the quarter, and we think that's directly related to the better values that we've offered. Looking ahead now, we think the merchandise mix might at some point shift back in the other direction when the pandemic's over. You'd certainly expect trends to go back to some degree of normal, maybe a different new normal. But, at some point, people will have a desire to dress up a little more again. If that does happen, then we'd expect that mix impact in our AUR. It may come back the other way. But, if it does happen, there's a good chance that that potentially good news would be offset by the downward pressure on AUR as we continue to execute the Burlington 2.0 strategy, looking to drive sales by offering that great merchandise value at great prices. So, that would likely mean our AUR would stay below historical levels, netting the two together as we look forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. I hope everyone's ready for Thanksgiving and the holiday season. I have a question for Michael and then one for John, if I can. So, just first, Michael, what's your assessment of merchandise availability? I think, everyone's interested in what you're seeing right now, but also on the longer term outlook, some of the publicly -- public vendors have talked about taking a more conservative approach going forward as it relates to inventory going into the off-price channel. Are you concerned that this is constraining to your growth overall?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, John. Good question. John, you've followed off-price retail for a long time. So, I think, you'll know that availability has always been the age-old question in off-price, certainly if you go back -- if you would go back 30 years and the concern has always been that off-price retailers will run out of supply. Clearly, that has not happened. Off-price has achieved huge growth over that period. Let me talk about the reasons why. But before I do -- let me address the short-term availability first, and then I'll talk about longer term. Short-term availability, I would say that the quick answer is that in the short term, overall, the availability of off-price merchandise has been and continues to be very strong. We're pleased with the opportunities that we're seeing. We're happy with the assortments and the values in our stores. Now, that's not to say that there aren't some gaps, some brands, some categories where we'd like more supply, there always are. That's the nature of off-price. It's always -- the off-price supply is always a little lumpy. But overall, I would characterize availability now -- right now as very good. But, I think, the more important part of your question was the longer term. We have -- here at Burlington, we have ambitious growth plans over the next several years. We believe, as I described in my prepared remarks, that we have an opportunity to take significant market share in the years ahead. So, it's a good question. Do I think we will be constrained by merchandise supply? No. No. I really do not think that. As you'd expect, over the years, I've spent quite a lot of time looking at this issue of off-price supply. And when I hear concerns about supply in off-price, I understand what triggers those concerns. But I have to say, I'm very skeptical about those concerns. And my skepticism is really based on two factors. Number one, I think, it's very important to understand that our relationship with our vendors is very strong. It is a partnership. It's not transactional. It's a long-term relationship. For the categories that we sell, the SKU count, the complexity, the lead times, all of those factors make it very difficult for vendors to precisely forecast how many units of the styles are produced. Now, because of the off-price channel, they actually don't have to get this right. They have an outlet, a partner for excess merchandise for overruns. They have a partner for canceled orders. So, the way to think about this is we lower the risk for them. Now, we want them to be successful, and we can help them grow their businesses. So, those relationships really are partnership. The second point I would make, and this is very important, is that we compete in many different categories. We have thousands of vendors and brands that we do business with. We aren't reliant on any single and only one vendor. Our largest vendor is no more than a small percentage of our sales. So, it could absolutely be true that an individual vendor might cut back, but that wouldn't really make much of a difference to us in the bigger scheme of things. In fact, as we grow our vendor base -- sorry, as we grow, I think, our vendor base is likely to increase significantly as well. In some of our most important underpenetrated businesses, businesses like home or beauty, the underlying vendor base is actually very fragmented. You have a lot of very small vendors. So, as we grow those businesses in particular, I would expect the vendor count will increase actually at a much greater rate than it has in the past. With all that said - with everything I've just said, my expectation is that there will be times when there are specific brands or specific vendors that have more or less availability. That's always going to be true. As an off-price retailer, we recognize that that means that there will be gaps in our assortment. But, to come back to your main question, am I concerned that this will constrain our growth? No, for the reasons I've described it, I'm really not.\nJohn Kernan: All right. Thanks, Michael. Second question is for John, just on the 25,000-square-foot prototype. It seems like a big opportunity. Interested in hearing more about the thinking and the financial planning that led to the smaller format. And then, in particular, any early information or expectations around productivity, profitability and then, the potential store numbers over time?\nJohn Crimmins: Well, sure, John. Thanks for your question. Good question. John, you've been following us since the beginning. So, I don't think I have to tell you that we've got a pretty good history of continually reducing the amount of inventory we've had in our stores. It's been going on for many years now. And as we've been doing that, we've been able to reduce our store size each year for the last however back -- however far back you want to go. To the point, at this year, our average store size is just under 40,000 square feet. So, this has really been kind of a learning opportunity for us. We've been continually reducing the box size, operating with leaner inventories and learned quite a bit on the operating side. And then, now, we've got our Burlington 2.0 off-price full potential strategy, where one of the main principles is to run with even leaner inventories. So, this leaner inventory is -- and the confidence that we have in that is, I guess, you'd call it an enabler really of how much farther we think we can take our smaller box size. We've been really pleased with the initial progress we've seen as we started to work on these initiatives. So, this stuff altogether just gives us added confidence in our ability to do this and a little bit of a clearer path to further in-store inventory reductions. So altogether, kind of higher confidence and better visibility to how we can get to this 25,000 square-foot prototype. So, while this stuff has been going on, particularly in the past year, our real estate team, our store design, inventory planning and store operations teams have been working on actual prototype for the 25,000 square-foot store. And we feel really good about the detailed merchandising and operational plans that they've been developing. So, we're really excited about the potential that we see for the smaller stores. In terms of the actual store-level economics and our opening plans, I'm going to wait until our next call in March to get more specific on that. But, we do believe the smaller prototype offers potential for higher sales productivity and better expense efficiency. And we think that over time, it's likely to become a central element of both our new store and our existing store relocation plans as we kind of sort through our portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. So, Michael, you spoke about traffic declines in the quarter. How concerned are you that shopper behavior may have changed during the pandemic? Do you think some of the business that has moved to online won't come back to bricks-and-mortar?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Hi, Lorraine. Yes, I think, it's a very good, very important question. There's no doubt we could all see that e-commerce has grown significantly because of the pandemic. And my guess is that some of the share gain will be permanent. I think, some of this share shift would likely have happened anyway over the next few years, but the pandemic accelerated it. And I don't think -- as I said in my remarks, I do not think that as we get through the pandemic, shopping patterns will just go back completely to the way that they were. No, I actually think that that share shift though, that share gain by e-commerce is going to have the effect of critically undermining full-price bricks-and-mortar retailers, especially mall-based retailers. It seems likely that that will drive a wave of rationalization and store closures in the retail industry. I think, we're just really seeing the start of that. The most important question for us is where do these customers go when a physical department store or a specialty retailer store closes? Now, for sure, some of that business will go online permanently, as I said in my prepared remarks. That seems especially likely for more affluent, time-starved shoppers, if you like. But, our hypothesis is that many of the more value-oriented shoppers will find their way to off-price. If we can offer them great assortments at great values, then I actually think we can grow and take market share once we get through the pandemic. Now, the underlying premise of what I've just said is that we can satisfy these value-oriented shoppers more effectively and more competitively than e-commerce. And actually, I've had this conversation with many of the investors on this call. We operate an $11, $12 average unit retail business with a very broad fashion assortment. It is economically and strategically very difficult for an e-commerce business to compete with us at these price points in the categories where we compete. The other point that I would make is that this isn't just a conceptual argument. It's actually what has been happening for several years now. E-commerce has been growing for some time. And the full-price bricks-and-mortar department store and specialty store channels have been shrinking for some time. Meanwhile, off-price retail has been growing and taking share. We at Burlington, for example, have been growing our top line in the high single digits each year for the last several years. So, bringing it all back together, we believe that in the aftermath of the pandemic, we could see an acceleration of the trends that I've just described and not a reversal of them.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. And then, for John, I appreciated the breakdown of product sourcing cost that you gave in the comments. I was just curious, what proportion of these costs do you think might be permanent?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Okay, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. So, it's complicated. So, I'll kind of go through some of the stuff I said on the call and then maybe put it in kind of a go-forward context as well. So, let me just start reminding what's in product sourcing cost. For us, that includes all the cost of our supply chain and all the cost of our merchandising operations. And as I said in the -- in our prepared remarks that overall, the product sourcing costs all together delevered by 360 basis points during the third quarter. So, supply chain drove 280 bps of that deleverage. About 100 basis points or $16 million of that we consider to be temporary COVID-related costs. And in this bucket, we'd include the temporary recruiting costs and wage incentives that we had to use to get our DCs properly staffed quickly to get our store inventories back to appropriate levels, along with some costs related to the safety protocols that we've put in place to protect our DC associates. About 70 basis points of the supply chain piece of the deleverage were related to the wage increases that we've had to do, actually since the third quarter. We had some wage increases that we had planned for this year and actually put in place earlier in 2020. But then, we had some incremental costs. It was in response to changes in the DC labor market during the pandemic as the market became so much more competitive. So, the adjustments we've made, we think have been successful in getting our DCs properly staffed. And we believe our DC labor rates are now properly positioned. But, of course, this piece, it's a permanent wage increase. So, that is going to be part of our expense structure as we think about moving forward. The other factor that's causing the remaining 100 bps or so of supply chain deleverage were occupancy deleverage, the decrease in AUR, changes in product mix and an increase in receipts processed versus sales we had during the quarter as we rebuilt our inventories back to appropriate levels. So, first, the occupancy deleverages. We opened a couple of facilities that aren't yet fully utilized. So, that's a piece that we would expect this to get better over time as we move toward full utilization. One was for processing and one was for -- more for storage. But longer term, as you would expect, we're -- periodically, we do bring in other new facilities online. So, you kind of go through a cycle deleverage that may hit kind of capacity. And then eventually, if they're efficient as we expect them to be, they would actually help leverage. Of the other components, the one that from a go-forward standpoint, think about the most is the decrease in AUR. But as we've said, it's not necessarily all bad news. While a smaller AUR does translate to more units and higher supply chain costs, one of the drivers of the decrease is our focus on delivering better value to our customers, which of course, should help drive sales and lead to fewer markdowns. Now, as you would expect, we are looking at initiatives that we can pursue within our supply chain to try and offset some of these headwinds. But, some of these initiatives, especially as it relates to driving significant productivity, efficiency increases, they're going to have some lead time. We're going to finalize our financial plan for 2021, as I said earlier, over the next couple of months. But we've still got a lot of work to do. Having said that, we are expecting significant deleverage headwinds on supply chain compared to our 2019 expense structure, as I've shared a little earlier. So, that's the supply chain piece of product sourcing cost. In addition to that 280 basis points, we had 80 basis points of deleverage from lost sales leverage on our fixed merchandising organization costs and from Burlington 2.0 investments, we continue to make -- to improve our merchandising capabilities that we think are going to be well worth it when we get to the other side of the pandemic. So, typically, we'd look to offset incremental investments in the year that we're making them with efficiency savings, but we really didn't push that this year. We had so much going on with COVID that we wanted to be sure we're spending adequately in some of the places like store payroll, where we may have pushed for efficiency in a different year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you. And thank you so much for all the detail today. It's been extremely helpful. Michael, I wanted to just reflect back on the Burlington 2.0 strategy that you laid out roundly a year ago and particularly focused on the inventory journey, because this year has obviously brought an unprecedented opportunity, let's say, to maybe accelerate what you had thought might be a three or four, or I'm not sure, maybe even a five-year journey toward ever more efficient levels of inventory in store with faster turns. COVID perhaps accelerated the journey. And I'm wondering if you can reflect on that and if you can share with us the way you're thinking about the impact of 2020 on that inventory journey. And do you think in some ways that it's accelerated your learnings; your insight and it will allow you to get to those leaner in-store inventories with faster turns maybe a year or two in advance of those original targets? Thank so much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Kimberly, nice to hear from you. You're right. Actually, I joined Burlington just over a year ago. So, I just celebrated my one-year anniversary. And maybe I should start out by saying it's been a heck of a year. But it's -- joking aside, let me sort of address the progress that we've made over the past 12 months versus what my expectations might have been back then. The first thing I'd say is that I'm very pleased. The thing I'm most pleased about is that we have -- at Burlington, I feel like we have a very clear direction. We have a what I'm going to call a transformational strategy. It's a strategy that's well understood and has a huge amount of support and traction within the Company. So, I feel like we know where we're going. Secondly, and this kind of gets to your question, despite everything that's happened this year and the challenges we faced, I think, we've been able to make pretty significant progress against this strategy, and some of that progress has come from -- has come in the form of real changes that we've made to the business, greater focus on value; faster turns; more liquidity; more aggressive chase; greater urgency; and getting receipts to the sales floor. Well, all of those things are real, and in some ways, they've been accelerated by the pandemic and by the issues and challenges we've faced. We've also been able to make progress in some other areas like some of the initiatives that I talked about earlier that are at a sort of earlier stage of development and implementation. Those are important. Those are going to be important in the years ahead. But, if I narrow it down to your specific question on inventory, I mentioned -- in response to an earlier question, I mentioned that as we think about margin opportunity with Burlington 2.0, we really think about that margin opportunity in 3 buckets, lower markdowns; higher sales; and lower occupancy. And if you were just to, at a very high level, say where is the margin improvement, quantify the margin improvement across those three, I would say, it's a third, a third, a third. So I think a third of the improvement can come from greater sales productivity, a third from lower occupancy and a third from lower markdowns. I feel like we've made a lot of progress on that lower markdowns piece this year, but I want to temper my answer a little bit. There have been some very unusual circumstances that have helped us get there this year. We've ended up turning inventories faster than we ever would have planned. So, I think we've made progress this year, but we really need a year or two to consolidate that progress and to make sure that the gains that we've made are captured over the longer term. But, that's how I would characterize that. I feel like we've made much more progress on that inventory piece than I would have expected in a relatively short period of time. But, it's too early to declare victory. It's too early to take back to the banks just yet. We need a bit of time to really consolidate around that.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to talking to you again in early March to discuss our fourth quarter results. Meanwhile, I know that it's going to feel different and maybe a little subdued this year, but I would like to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the third quarter, total sales decreased 6%, while comparable store sales decreased 11%. As Michael described earlier, our comparable store sales improved significantly after our inventories recovered to more appropriate levels at the end of August. We believe this improvement was driven by our improved inventory position, the delay in back-to-school purchases, and the outstanding values offered to our customers from the great merchandise buys we were able to deliver in Q3. The gross margin rate was 45.0%, an increase of 260 basis points versus last year's rate of 42.4%. This improvement was primarily driven by lower markdowns and higher markup, which were partially offset by increased freight costs. We do not expect to be able to generate the same level of year-over-year gross margin improvement in Q4 that we were able to achieve in Q3. There are two reasons for this. First, while our clearance levels are down versus last year at the end of Q3, clearance inventory entering Q3 was extraordinarily low due to our aggressive Q2 clearance strategy. That significantly reduced our clearance markdowns in August, which we don't believe is repeatable in Q4. Second, while we significantly exceeded our planned sales in Q3, sales for Q4 remained very uncertain due to the impact of the pandemic, which would affect our inventory and markdown levels, depending on how sales play out during the holiday season. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs, were $144 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $90 million last year, increasing 360 basis points as a percentage of sales. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we had expected significant deleverage in product sourcing cost for the third quarter for a number of reasons. Like most other retailers, we struggled at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter as we tried to get our DCs fully staffed and operating effectively. We prioritized inventory flow over cost efficiencies during the quarter as our teams work to get inventory back to appropriate levels in our stores and then to chase the positive trends we were seeing as we experienced sales well above our planned levels during the quarter. Supply chain costs caused 280 basis points of the product sourcing cost deleverage. About 100 basis points or $16 million of this deleverage was driven by temporary COVID-related costs, which include recruiting expenses and incentives we put in place as we work to get our DC teams back to full strength. Wage rate increases since last year drove another 70 basis points of deleverage. The balance of supply chain deleverage was driven by 4 additional factors: Occupancy costs, as we added additional storage and processing space that is not yet fully utilized; A decrease in AUR; Changes in product mix; And a disproportionate increase in receipt volume processed as we work to catch up on rebuilding our inventories. The remaining deleverage in product sourcing costs came from buying costs as we lost sales leverage on the fixed cost base of our merchandising organization while continuing to invest in improving our merchandising capabilities. We do expect continued significant deleverage in product sourcing cost in the fourth quarter, though we could see some modest improvement in rate even at similar sales volumes as the DC recruiting and temporary incentive costs will be behind us. The best way to think about modeling product sourcing costs for the fourth quarter is to assume a similar dollar level of product sourcing costs to what we incurred in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $495 million versus $486 million last year, increasing 240 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A deleverage was primarily due to increases in store-related and corporate costs, including $20 million in COVID-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing expense. As the pandemic continues and seems likely to worsen during the fourth quarter, we will continue to plan our business and our inventory levels conservatively and adjust to the trends we see. While our SG&A expense will flex with our sales volume, we could see continued SG&A deleverage in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBIT decreased $81 million to $59 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by the lower sales volume and increased product sourcing costs. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter. We have $348 million remaining on our share repurchase program, which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.12 versus income of $1.44 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.29 versus a profit of $1.53 per share last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.3 billion in cash, $250 million in borrowings on our ABL, $958 million on our senior secured term loan facility, base value of $805 million in convertible notes and $300 million in senior secured notes. We had unused ABL availability of approximately $292 million. We ended the period with total balance sheet debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Merchandise inventories were $867 million versus $1,004 million last year, a 14% decrease. In the last few months, we have made an adjustment to how we classify our merchandise inventories. This reclassification is intended to better reflect our strategy to drive faster turns of in-store inventories, while at the same time taking advantage of great opportunistic buys that will be stored for later release. Using this updated classification, our merchandise inventories at the end of Q3 broke down as follows. First of all, in-store inventories. This includes inventory that is in our stores, on its way to stores or being processed at the DC to be sent to stores. These inventories were down about 20% on a comp store basis at the end of Q3. This was in line with our plan of down 20% to 25% versus last year. Secondly, reserve inventories. This includes all inventory that is being stored for later release, either later in the season or in a subsequent season. This reserve inventory was up 8% at the end of Q3. It represented 25% of total inventory at the end of Q3 compared to 19% last year. I'll talk more about this in a moment. During the quarter, we opened 30 net new stores, bringing our total store count at the end of the third quarter to 769 stores. This included 30 new store openings and 7 relocations. In the fourth quarter, we do not expect to open any new stores, but do expect to close 8 stores, resulting in an expected fiscal year-end store count of 761 stores. As compared to our outlook on our last earnings call, we still will open 62 new stores in fiscal 2020, but we decided to close 2 additional stores. As discussed in the last earnings call, we still expect to open the 18 new stores in fiscal 2021 that were shifted from opening in fiscal 2020. We will have more to say on our 2021 expected new store openings as well as our broader real estate strategy over the next several years on our fourth quarter call in March. Net capital expenditures were $188 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $245 million for fiscal 2020. Now, I will turn to some comments on our outlook. As described earlier, the sales trend for the fourth quarter is very difficult to forecast. Our month-to-date comp for November is down low double digits. We believe that this month-to-date trend has been negatively affected by the warmer year-over-year temperatures. But even once the weather turns around, the range of possible outcomes for the remainder of the fourth quarter is very wide. It is possible that the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and actions and restrictions taken by government authorities in response could have a significant negative impact on the trend. Given this uncertainty, we will not be issuing formal sales and earnings guidance again this quarter. We continue to plan the business conservatively, keeping tight control over liquidity, inventory and expenses. This posture gives us the flexibility from a liquidity and open-to-buy standpoint to flex up our receipts and opportunistic purchases if we see a stronger sales trend than expected. We were able to demonstrate that ability as we flexed up our receipts to chase September and October sales, and we will take that same flexible approach to planning and reacting to what we see in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, if trends are below expectations, we'll have the flexibility and liquidity to pull back on our purchases, if necessary. As I explained a moment ago, our in-store inventories at the end of Q3 were down about 20% on a comp store basis, which was in line with plan. During the fourth quarter, we will continue to manage in-store inventories conservatively versus last year. In contrast, we expect to significantly increase our reserve inventory. At the end of Q3, this inventory was up 8% versus last year. This increase would have been more significant, but for the fact that we deliberately push some of our reserve inventory purchases from Q3 into Q4. We did this for two reasons. First, to free up supply chain capacity for current and holiday merchandise. And second, because we believe that the buying environment for this merchandise could be even more attractive in the fourth quarter. If this turns out to be correct, then we estimate that reserve inventory by the end of January could be up more than 50% compared to last year. Finally, as we did last quarter, we can update you on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items that may be useful for modeling purposes. Capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances, are now expected to be approximately $245 million. We expect to open 62 new stores, but now anticipate relocating or closing 28 stores for a revised total of 34 net new stores in fiscal 2020. Previously, we had expected to close or relocate 26 stores. Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favorable lease costs, is now expected to be approximately $225 million. And interest expense, excluding $24 million in noncash interest on the convertible notes, is now expected to be approximately $75 million. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Sure. Thanks, Michael, and good morning, Ike. Obviously, we still got a lot of work to do on our plan for next year. But I think we can share a little color kind of how we're thinking about it as we put it together this year. Usually, when we start to build an annual plan, we're going to set objectives based on what we want to achieve compared to the current year. But since 2020 has been such a unique unusual year, we're going to look back to 2019 as the base year for our 2021 plan. So, we'll focus on how 2021 is going to differ from 2019. Again, normally, one of the first assumptions that you'd lock in on would be comp sales growth. But we still have the pandemic going on. It seems to be getting worse before it's likely to get better. We're optimistic that there may be an end in sight. But yes, it's going to continue to impact all of retail, and that's going to make -- sales is likely going to be a little bit of a roller coaster as it's been this year. So, this means we're going to have to plan conservatively and then we're going to look to flex to the business trends that as we see them develop. Now, the good news on that is we've had some pretty good practice at doing that this year. So, that means we're going to have conservative comp assumptions. Whenever you have conservative comp assumptions, it's going to be difficult to drive operating margin expansion. And it's going to be even more difficult in 2021 because we're building a plan from a base year of 2019. So, if you think about it, we will have experienced two years of fixed expense inflation increases. So, ignoring any other cost headwinds, we'd have to cover that with adequate sales growth before we begin to see our normal expense leverage. And while we do expect some of the temporary COVID-related expenses to end when the pandemic ends, we could see that we will have some headwinds that are still going to be there. So, what we can see now, we've seen supply chain wage pressures that we had to respond to in this year. And we've seen a lower AUR trend, as we -- Michael just talked about for what we've seen in the third quarter. We do expect the lower AUR to drive sales, as Michael described. But it also means that there is more units to process per dollar of sales. While we're confident that over time we can mitigate these expense pressures, we've got a history of kind of always been able to figure that out. But, some of our mitigating actions, like reengineering production processes or automating others are going to take a little longer. They're going to have some lead time. So again, compared to 2019, we're expecting to see pretty significant deleverage of supply chain expenses in 2021. As I said a moment ago, we still have a lot of work to do over the next few months. And we're going to be in a much better position to share more detail on our sales and our expense plans during our March call. Sure, Ike. Yes. First, let me kind of talk about what we saw in the third quarter a little bit in AUR. Yes. I think that the biggest driver of this, our mix of merchandise. Consumers are interested in different things now than they were prior to the pandemic. Our strongest merchandise category is right now things like casual, apparel, active, athletic, basics, essentials, palm merchandise, all the ones that you think of when people are not back to their normal lives. On average, these have a lower AUR than the merchandise categories that haven't been as strong. So, we kind of traded off sales in these lower AUR categories, and we're not -- we're seeing not as strong sales in things like career where structured apparel, tailored clothing, the more dressy categories. And in general, more dressy tends to means higher price; and in general, less dressy tends to mean lower price. So that's one of the drivers. The second driver would be our pricing. We've been working across all our merchandise categories to have sharper, more competitive pricing. As Michael has been talking about, we believe that in off-price, the most effective way to drive sales is to offer the best possible merchandise value. That's what the customer really cares about. The last couple of quarters, that's what our merchants have been focused on, offering great value, and it's been working. As Michael mentioned, the number of units per basket rose by more than 20% in the quarter, and we think that's directly related to the better values that we've offered. Looking ahead now, we think the merchandise mix might at some point shift back in the other direction when the pandemic's over. You'd certainly expect trends to go back to some degree of normal, maybe a different new normal. But, at some point, people will have a desire to dress up a little more again. If that does happen, then we'd expect that mix impact in our AUR. It may come back the other way. But, if it does happen, there's a good chance that that potentially good news would be offset by the downward pressure on AUR as we continue to execute the Burlington 2.0 strategy, looking to drive sales by offering that great merchandise value at great prices. So, that would likely mean our AUR would stay below historical levels, netting the two together as we look forward. Well, sure, John. Thanks for your question. Good question. John, you've been following us since the beginning. So, I don't think I have to tell you that we've got a pretty good history of continually reducing the amount of inventory we've had in our stores. It's been going on for many years now. And as we've been doing that, we've been able to reduce our store size each year for the last however back -- however far back you want to go. To the point, at this year, our average store size is just under 40,000 square feet. So, this has really been kind of a learning opportunity for us. We've been continually reducing the box size, operating with leaner inventories and learned quite a bit on the operating side. And then, now, we've got our Burlington 2.0 off-price full potential strategy, where one of the main principles is to run with even leaner inventories. So, this leaner inventory is -- and the confidence that we have in that is, I guess, you'd call it an enabler really of how much farther we think we can take our smaller box size. We've been really pleased with the initial progress we've seen as we started to work on these initiatives. So, this stuff altogether just gives us added confidence in our ability to do this and a little bit of a clearer path to further in-store inventory reductions. So altogether, kind of higher confidence and better visibility to how we can get to this 25,000 square-foot prototype. So, while this stuff has been going on, particularly in the past year, our real estate team, our store design, inventory planning and store operations teams have been working on actual prototype for the 25,000 square-foot store. And we feel really good about the detailed merchandising and operational plans that they've been developing. So, we're really excited about the potential that we see for the smaller stores. In terms of the actual store-level economics and our opening plans, I'm going to wait until our next call in March to get more specific on that. But, we do believe the smaller prototype offers potential for higher sales productivity and better expense efficiency. And we think that over time, it's likely to become a central element of both our new store and our existing store relocation plans as we kind of sort through our portfolio. Yes. Okay, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. So, it's complicated. So, I'll kind of go through some of the stuff I said on the call and then maybe put it in kind of a go-forward context as well. So, let me just start reminding what's in product sourcing cost. For us, that includes all the cost of our supply chain and all the cost of our merchandising operations. And as I said in the -- in our prepared remarks that overall, the product sourcing costs all together delevered by 360 basis points during the third quarter. So, supply chain drove 280 bps of that deleverage. About 100 basis points or $16 million of that we consider to be temporary COVID-related costs. And in this bucket, we'd include the temporary recruiting costs and wage incentives that we had to use to get our DCs properly staffed quickly to get our store inventories back to appropriate levels, along with some costs related to the safety protocols that we've put in place to protect our DC associates. About 70 basis points of the supply chain piece of the deleverage were related to the wage increases that we've had to do, actually since the third quarter. We had some wage increases that we had planned for this year and actually put in place earlier in 2020. But then, we had some incremental costs. It was in response to changes in the DC labor market during the pandemic as the market became so much more competitive. So, the adjustments we've made, we think have been successful in getting our DCs properly staffed. And we believe our DC labor rates are now properly positioned. But, of course, this piece, it's a permanent wage increase. So, that is going to be part of our expense structure as we think about moving forward. The other factor that's causing the remaining 100 bps or so of supply chain deleverage were occupancy deleverage, the decrease in AUR, changes in product mix and an increase in receipts processed versus sales we had during the quarter as we rebuilt our inventories back to appropriate levels. So, first, the occupancy deleverages. We opened a couple of facilities that aren't yet fully utilized. So, that's a piece that we would expect this to get better over time as we move toward full utilization. One was for processing and one was for -- more for storage. But longer term, as you would expect, we're -- periodically, we do bring in other new facilities online. So, you kind of go through a cycle deleverage that may hit kind of capacity. And then eventually, if they're efficient as we expect them to be, they would actually help leverage. Of the other components, the one that from a go-forward standpoint, think about the most is the decrease in AUR. But as we've said, it's not necessarily all bad news. While a smaller AUR does translate to more units and higher supply chain costs, one of the drivers of the decrease is our focus on delivering better value to our customers, which of course, should help drive sales and lead to fewer markdowns. Now, as you would expect, we are looking at initiatives that we can pursue within our supply chain to try and offset some of these headwinds. But, some of these initiatives, especially as it relates to driving significant productivity, efficiency increases, they're going to have some lead time. We're going to finalize our financial plan for 2021, as I said earlier, over the next couple of months. But we've still got a lot of work to do. Having said that, we are expecting significant deleverage headwinds on supply chain compared to our 2019 expense structure, as I've shared a little earlier. So, that's the supply chain piece of product sourcing cost. In addition to that 280 basis points, we had 80 basis points of deleverage from lost sales leverage on our fixed merchandising organization costs and from Burlington 2.0 investments, we continue to make -- to improve our merchandising capabilities that we think are going to be well worth it when we get to the other side of the pandemic. So, typically, we'd look to offset incremental investments in the year that we're making them with efficiency savings, but we really didn't push that this year. We had so much going on with COVID that we wanted to be sure we're spending adequately in some of the places like store payroll, where we may have pushed for efficiency in a different year."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this morning's third quarter earnings call. We are very glad that you could be with us. We are going to structure this morning's discussion as follows: First, review our third quarter results; Second, I will talk about the outlook for Q4; Third, I will describe how we are thinking about the post-pandemic world and what actions we are taking to prepare for it. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay. Let's start with the third quarter. Our comparable store sales performance in the third quarter exceeded our expectations at down 11% versus last year. I think, it is important to breakdown this comp performance in more detail than we normally would. As we came into the quarter, the trend was very weak and comp store sales for August ended down more than 20%. The weak trend in August was driven by two main factors. Firstly, as we came into the third quarter, our in-store inventory position was well below where we wanted it to be. We discussed the underlying reasons for this in our second quarter earnings call. It was not until the end of August that in-store inventories reached planned levels. Secondly, back-to-school is typically the dominant driver of traffic into our stores in early Q3. This traffic did not materialize in August, and for a awhile, we did not know, if back-to-school would happen at all. Once we go through August, both of these factors turned around. By early September, our in-store inventory levels had recovered and the back-to-school traffic that we had expected in August finally showed up in September. Our baseline plan for Q3 had been minus 20% comp, but in September and October, we chased the trend to minus 4% comp for the combined two-month period. Our gross margin in Q3 was up approximately 260 basis points. This was driven by higher markup and by lower markdowns. The buying environment in Q2 and Q3 was very strong, and our merchants took advantage of great opportunistic deals. These deals allowed us to successfully pass along terrific value to the customer. We were pleased with our Q3 markup performance, but we do not believe that this higher markup is sustainable. As the buying environment normalizes, our goal will be to continue to use opportunistic buying to offer great value and thereby drive sales. But we do not expect to capture higher markup as a normal course of business. The other key driver of our improved gross margin was a faster inventory turn and lower markdowns. Again, there were certain aspects of Q3 that were very unusual and that contributed to this improvement. We do not expect to achieve a similar level of markdown improvement in the fourth quarter. I would like to turn now to the sales outlook for the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the environment remains very unpredictable. In fact, the situation across the country with COVID-19 appears to be deteriorating. This is happening at the worst possible time for retail. The fourth quarter has gotten off to a weak start, with November month-to-date comp running down in the low double digits. Our assessment is that this initial weak trend has been driven by unseasonably warm weather, rather than by COVID. Typically, we would expect this impact to turn around later in the quarter. But there is risk that by then the resurgence in COVID-19 cases may have undermined an already fragile trend. Candidly, we just don't know. But, again, just like Q3, we need to be prepared for a wide range of possible outcomes. We are tightly controlling our inventories and liquidity. We will remain very flexible, either to pull back or to chase the sales trend. Together with everyone else on this call, we have been following the positive news on potential vaccines with great interest. This positive news suggests that the end of the pandemic is within sight. But realistically, this probably means that it will be the second half of 2021 before the retail environment starts to feel normal again. I would like to use the next few minutes to talk about how we are thinking about the post-pandemic world and more importantly what actions we are taking to prepare for it. As I have discussed on previous calls, in some important respects, we do not think that once we get through the pandemic, the world will just revert to the way it was. Our view is that the aftermath of the pandemic will lead to an acceleration in a couple of very important trends, trends that have been evident for some time. Firstly, the consumer desire and need for value; and secondly, the growth of e-commerce at the expense of full-price bricks-and-mortar retailers. We expect these trends to drive further rationalization of full-price bricks-and-mortar retail over the next several years. As these physical stores close, we expect that some shoppers, especially more affluent time-stopped shoppers will migrate more of their spending online. But we anticipate that other shoppers, value-oriented shoppers, will find their way to off-price. This is consistent with what has actually been happening over the last several years. E-commerce has been growing rapidly and bricks-and-mortar off-price retail has been growing in parallel. In the categories where we compete and at the low-price points that we offer, e-commerce is much less effective or competitive in meeting the needs of value-oriented shoppers. As the store closings that I have described play out, there will be an opportunity for bricks-and-mortar off-price retail to gain significant share. Our priority at Burlington as the smallest, least developed and least profitable of the major off-price retailers, is to position ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity. We have talked in the past about Burlington 2.0, our off-price full potential strategy. The core objective of Burlington 2.0 is to significantly improve how we execute the off-price model. I would like to use our Q3 results to describe some of the ways in which Burlington 2.0 is already having an impact on the business. To be clear, no one at Burlington will ever be happy with a decline in comp store sales, but there were some positive aspects of this performance to call out, number one, in the summer, our merchants did a great job going after tremendous opportunistic buys. As these receipts finally arrived in stores, they ignited the sales trend in early September. Number two, we then chased this sales trend. We controlled and channeled our liquidity to go after the strongest merchandise categories and to shift the assortment. The overriding focus was on offering wow value.  Number three, in our supply chain and in our stores, we put huge emphasis and urgency on getting the fresh receipts through the system and out to the sales floor. This worked despite significant ahead-of-plan sales, in-store inventories came in almost exactly on plan at the end of Q3. Number four, we managed these inventory levels deliberately and conservatively, driving the ahead-of-plan sales through a faster turn and thereby driving lower markdowns. Overall, I am pleased with these aspects of our performance. I see them as early signs of progress with Burlington 2.0. We can and we will get better. This improved execution of the off-price model will be very important as we position ourselves for the post-pandemic world and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. The things that I have just talked about, much greater focus on value, tighter liquidity control, lower inventories and more urgency in receipt flow, as I've described, these are already important and growing aspects of how we are managing the business. But there are other aspects of Burlington 2.0 that are at a much earlier stage of development or implementation. I would like to share some high-level updates on three of these, marketing; merchandising; and our store prototype. First of all, marketing. Our marketing team has done some great work this year looking at how we can communicate a stronger, much more direct off-price value message and how we can deliver this communication in a more targeted and cost-effective way. We will start to roll out these changes in Q4. We believe that this new marketing program will help to leverage our marketing reach and spend in the years ahead. Secondly, our merchandising organization. As we have discussed in the past, we believe that the key enabler of better executing the off-price model and driving growth in our business is to invest in our merchandising capabilities. I am very excited about the organizational growth plan that we have developed for our buying and planning group. It involves a combination of external hires and very importantly, the development and promotion of internal talent. In terms of external hires, we are pleased and somewhat surprised at the number and the quality of candidates that we have successfully interviewed, hired and on-boarded this year, despite the pandemic. We are also excited about the pipeline of external candidates. There are two factors that are helping us. The pandemic itself is obviously causing major disruption in the retail industry. This is freeing up some terrific merchandising talent and experience. Secondly, we have an extremely compelling story. As the smallest of the major off-price retailers, we have a lot of growth ahead of us. In many merchandising categories, the Company is at a relatively early stage of its development. And talented merchants and planners who join our team now have a great opportunity to participate in our growth, and at the same time, drive their own personal and professional development in the years to come. The other critical aspect of our organizational growth plan is the development of internal talent, growing our own. We have a lot of high potential talent in our merchandising and planning organization. I am excited to see this talent grow and take on more responsibility. Internal promotions are a key part of our organizational plan. We have stepped up our training and development programs this year, and we have plans to do much more over the next few years. The third aspect of Burlington 2.0 that I would like to update you on is our store prototype. As we have discussed in the past, we believe that we have an opportunity to significantly improve store level productivity and economics by further reducing the size of our stores. Our real estate and store operations teams have done a lot of work in the past year on a 25,000 square-foot store prototype. We feel good about the merchandising and operational plans that we have developed for this smaller prototype. We expect the economics of this format to be very favorable, and we anticipate that it will become a central part of our new store opening and relocation programs, especially from 2022 onwards. We will be finalizing these plans over the next several months, and we expect to have more details to share with you in our fourth quarter earnings call in March 2021. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials. Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to express my warm appreciation and gratitude to all our associates at Burlington. We continue to operate in the midst of a global health crisis, which is likely to continue to impact our lives in the months ahead. This is a challenging time, but it is also a very exciting time at the Company. There are a lot of very good things happening. The way that our associates have mobilized behind Burlington 2.0 has been particularly impressive and further reinforces my belief and confidence in our prospects over the next several years. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Sure. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. I'm going to start by reading the actual data, and then I'll provide some editorial commentary. So, let's see. Traffic for the quarter was off by more than 20%. Our average basket size in units was up by more than 20%. Our average unit retail, so the average price per unit, was down about 10%. If you combine those items, the average transaction size in dollars was higher by about 10%, low double digits. And if you mix all of those variables together, of course, you get minus 11% comp decline for the quarter. So, that's the data. Let me sort of offer up some conclusions that I would draw from this data. The first point I would make is that the decline in traffic versus last year is disappointing. It improved as we came out of August, but it was still weak in September and October. I think, there are really two factors that drove that weakness. First, most obviously, if you like, we're in a pandemic. There are shoppers who just are not going to be comfortable coming back into a bricks and mortar environment until we get through this. We have very robust safety and social distancing programs in our stores, and we've marketed these. But we realized that despite those measures, realistically, traffic is going to remain depressed until we get through the pandemic. So, that's the point number one. Point number two, I think we have to acknowledge that compared with our peers, we at Burlington, we're not necessarily a top-of-mind destination for some of the key merchandise categories that shoppers are most interested in right now. As I'll describe in a moment, we've made huge progress in areas like home and casual apparel. But we recognize that in these businesses, we are starting from further behind versus peers. The second conclusion that I would draw from the data though is much more positive. And it's that I think we are doing -- I think, we're doing an excellent job driving business with the traffic that is coming into our stores. We've shifted our assortment and we're offering great values, actually great values in many of the same categories that I just mentioned, categories that the customer wants to buy right now. We've significantly expanded our home, active, casual, essentials and basics merchandise assortments. This enabled us to chase the trend in September and October. Now, I think, you can actually see the stronger value in the lower AUR. And the higher basket size shows that the customers that are coming into the store are responding very well. They're buying many more items, and they're spending more during each visit. So, I think, these are encouraging indicators, encouraging indicators of what might happen if and when traffic levels pick up, once we get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Sure. Yes, it's a good question. That was a big part of the story on our last call. Let me chunk out my answer a little bit. I'll start with an update on our own internal supply chain, our own distribution centers. You'll recall that in August, we explained that along with many other retailers, we'd run into significant staffing issues in our distribution centers and that those issues had really hampered our ability to get in-store inventories up to planned levels as fast as we would have liked. The simple update here is that those issues have been resolved. In Q3, we took a number of actions, including higher wage rates and on-boarding incentives. And these actions worked. We've been very happy with how our distribution centers have been able to ramp up for peak holiday production in October and November month-to-date. And right now, obviously, we're at that peak processing level. So, that's the update on our own internal supply chain. But, the broader sort of industry-wide issues has not gone away. There are chronic delays in merchandise deliveries across the retail industry. I'm sure that you've heard this elsewhere. These delays are being driven by, I would say, a number of factors, including ongoing staffing issues at vendor distribution facilities, timing issues kind of associated with the surge of orders that took place following the lockdown earlier this year. And then, I would also say import delays, specifically related to congestion at the West Coast ports. Now, we took a number of steps in the third quarter to sort of navigate our way around these issues. Remember, we've seen this movie before in Q2. So, we were aware of the risks. Our planners and buyers, I think, did a very good job juggling purchase orders and delivery dates. So, at the end of the third quarter, our in-store inventory levels were pretty much right on plan, but down 20% on a comp store basis. The last point I would make is just stepping back, and Matt, I'm sure you realize this. There is potentially a very important silver lining in the delays I've just described. In the coming weeks, these delivery delays across the industry are likely to translate into off-price supply. This could become an attractive off-price buying opportunity. And that's actually one of the reasons why we pushed some of our reserve inventory purchases to later in the fourth quarter. Well, good morning, Ike. Good to hear from you. I think, I'll break down the question into two different time periods. In the short term, what are our expectations for operating margins, specifically in 2021? In a moment, I'm going to ask John to address that. But first, let me talk about the longer term, what is the operating margin opportunity for Burlington over the next several years? Internally, as we've modeled the impact of Burlington 2.0, we've identified and sort of zeroed in on three main drivers of margin improvement. And, we believe that these three drivers represent the lion's share of the margin gap versus our peers. The first is sales. Of course, the higher sales, productivity drives leverage. The steps that we're taking to drive sales are the things that we've talked about, in particular, controlling our liquidity so we can chase trends and take advantage of opportunistic buys and heavily investing in merchandising capabilities, so we can deliver even stronger value across all categories and in particular, develop under penetrated categories. That's the first lever. The second lever is gross margin. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to turn our inventories faster than we have historically and thereby drive lower markdowns. One aspect of this, of course is as I've just mentioned, to drive higher sales, but the other critical enabler is tight control of inventory levels and also greater urgency in getting fresh receipts to the sales floor. If we do those things, I'm actually very confident we can drive faster inventory turns and significantly lower markdowns, and I kind of feel like we demonstrated that to some degree in the third quarter. The third driver of margin improvement is lower occupancy costs. Our stores are bigger and less productive than our peers. Again, driving higher sales will help. But, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe we have an opportunity to reduce the size of our store prototype, thereby reducing our occupancy expenses over time. Now, as part of Burlington 2.0, we have specific initiatives in place to go after each of the levers I've just described. Over the next several years, we expect, I expect to make significant progress in driving improvements in our operating margin. But that said, these things never necessarily work in a straight line. There are going to be short-term headwinds. And certainly, until we get through the pandemic, there will be challenges, either from deleverage on lower sales volumes or higher operating expenses, such as supply chain or COVID-related costs. On our fourth quarter call in March, we'll provide an updated view on these headwinds for 2021, but it might make sense. But now, maybe for John to provide some initial comments on what we think we may face next year. Good morning, John. Good question. John, you've followed off-price retail for a long time. So, I think, you'll know that availability has always been the age-old question in off-price, certainly if you go back -- if you would go back 30 years and the concern has always been that off-price retailers will run out of supply. Clearly, that has not happened. Off-price has achieved huge growth over that period. Let me talk about the reasons why. But before I do -- let me address the short-term availability first, and then I'll talk about longer term. Short-term availability, I would say that the quick answer is that in the short term, overall, the availability of off-price merchandise has been and continues to be very strong. We're pleased with the opportunities that we're seeing. We're happy with the assortments and the values in our stores. Now, that's not to say that there aren't some gaps, some brands, some categories where we'd like more supply, there always are. That's the nature of off-price. It's always -- the off-price supply is always a little lumpy. But overall, I would characterize availability now -- right now as very good. But, I think, the more important part of your question was the longer term. We have -- here at Burlington, we have ambitious growth plans over the next several years. We believe, as I described in my prepared remarks, that we have an opportunity to take significant market share in the years ahead. So, it's a good question. Do I think we will be constrained by merchandise supply? No. No. I really do not think that. As you'd expect, over the years, I've spent quite a lot of time looking at this issue of off-price supply. And when I hear concerns about supply in off-price, I understand what triggers those concerns. But I have to say, I'm very skeptical about those concerns. And my skepticism is really based on two factors. Number one, I think, it's very important to understand that our relationship with our vendors is very strong. It is a partnership. It's not transactional. It's a long-term relationship. For the categories that we sell, the SKU count, the complexity, the lead times, all of those factors make it very difficult for vendors to precisely forecast how many units of the styles are produced. Now, because of the off-price channel, they actually don't have to get this right. They have an outlet, a partner for excess merchandise for overruns. They have a partner for canceled orders. So, the way to think about this is we lower the risk for them. Now, we want them to be successful, and we can help them grow their businesses. So, those relationships really are partnership. The second point I would make, and this is very important, is that we compete in many different categories. We have thousands of vendors and brands that we do business with. We aren't reliant on any single and only one vendor. Our largest vendor is no more than a small percentage of our sales. So, it could absolutely be true that an individual vendor might cut back, but that wouldn't really make much of a difference to us in the bigger scheme of things. In fact, as we grow our vendor base -- sorry, as we grow, I think, our vendor base is likely to increase significantly as well. In some of our most important underpenetrated businesses, businesses like home or beauty, the underlying vendor base is actually very fragmented. You have a lot of very small vendors. So, as we grow those businesses in particular, I would expect the vendor count will increase actually at a much greater rate than it has in the past. With all that said - with everything I've just said, my expectation is that there will be times when there are specific brands or specific vendors that have more or less availability. That's always going to be true. As an off-price retailer, we recognize that that means that there will be gaps in our assortment. But, to come back to your main question, am I concerned that this will constrain our growth? No, for the reasons I've described it, I'm really not. Hi, Lorraine. Yes, I think, it's a very good, very important question. There's no doubt we could all see that e-commerce has grown significantly because of the pandemic. And my guess is that some of the share gain will be permanent. I think, some of this share shift would likely have happened anyway over the next few years, but the pandemic accelerated it. And I don't think -- as I said in my remarks, I do not think that as we get through the pandemic, shopping patterns will just go back completely to the way that they were. No, I actually think that that share shift though, that share gain by e-commerce is going to have the effect of critically undermining full-price bricks-and-mortar retailers, especially mall-based retailers. It seems likely that that will drive a wave of rationalization and store closures in the retail industry. I think, we're just really seeing the start of that. The most important question for us is where do these customers go when a physical department store or a specialty retailer store closes? Now, for sure, some of that business will go online permanently, as I said in my prepared remarks. That seems especially likely for more affluent, time-starved shoppers, if you like. But, our hypothesis is that many of the more value-oriented shoppers will find their way to off-price. If we can offer them great assortments at great values, then I actually think we can grow and take market share once we get through the pandemic. Now, the underlying premise of what I've just said is that we can satisfy these value-oriented shoppers more effectively and more competitively than e-commerce. And actually, I've had this conversation with many of the investors on this call. We operate an $11, $12 average unit retail business with a very broad fashion assortment. It is economically and strategically very difficult for an e-commerce business to compete with us at these price points in the categories where we compete. The other point that I would make is that this isn't just a conceptual argument. It's actually what has been happening for several years now. E-commerce has been growing for some time. And the full-price bricks-and-mortar department store and specialty store channels have been shrinking for some time. Meanwhile, off-price retail has been growing and taking share. We at Burlington, for example, have been growing our top line in the high single digits each year for the last several years. So, bringing it all back together, we believe that in the aftermath of the pandemic, we could see an acceleration of the trends that I've just described and not a reversal of them. Good morning, Kimberly, nice to hear from you. You're right. Actually, I joined Burlington just over a year ago. So, I just celebrated my one-year anniversary. And maybe I should start out by saying it's been a heck of a year. But it's -- joking aside, let me sort of address the progress that we've made over the past 12 months versus what my expectations might have been back then. The first thing I'd say is that I'm very pleased. The thing I'm most pleased about is that we have -- at Burlington, I feel like we have a very clear direction. We have a what I'm going to call a transformational strategy. It's a strategy that's well understood and has a huge amount of support and traction within the Company. So, I feel like we know where we're going. Secondly, and this kind of gets to your question, despite everything that's happened this year and the challenges we faced, I think, we've been able to make pretty significant progress against this strategy, and some of that progress has come from -- has come in the form of real changes that we've made to the business, greater focus on value; faster turns; more liquidity; more aggressive chase; greater urgency; and getting receipts to the sales floor. Well, all of those things are real, and in some ways, they've been accelerated by the pandemic and by the issues and challenges we've faced. We've also been able to make progress in some other areas like some of the initiatives that I talked about earlier that are at a sort of earlier stage of development and implementation. Those are important. Those are going to be important in the years ahead. But, if I narrow it down to your specific question on inventory, I mentioned -- in response to an earlier question, I mentioned that as we think about margin opportunity with Burlington 2.0, we really think about that margin opportunity in 3 buckets, lower markdowns; higher sales; and lower occupancy. And if you were just to, at a very high level, say where is the margin improvement, quantify the margin improvement across those three, I would say, it's a third, a third, a third. So I think a third of the improvement can come from greater sales productivity, a third from lower occupancy and a third from lower markdowns. I feel like we've made a lot of progress on that lower markdowns piece this year, but I want to temper my answer a little bit. There have been some very unusual circumstances that have helped us get there this year. We've ended up turning inventories faster than we ever would have planned. So, I think we've made progress this year, but we really need a year or two to consolidate that progress and to make sure that the gains that we've made are captured over the longer term. But, that's how I would characterize that. I feel like we've made much more progress on that inventory piece than I would have expected in a relatively short period of time. But, it's too early to declare victory. It's too early to take back to the banks just yet. We need a bit of time to really consolidate around that. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to talking to you again in early March to discuss our fourth quarter results. Meanwhile, I know that it's going to feel different and maybe a little subdued this year, but I would like to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Glick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation in today\u2019s conference call to discuss Burlington\u2019s fiscal 2020 second quarter operating results.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's second quarter earnings call. I hope that you are all keeping safe and well in these very challenging and difficult times. We are very glad that you could join us. Before we discuss our business results and outlook, I would like to take a moment to talk about racial justice. The cruel killing of George Floyd in May of this year triggered wide-spread protest and along overdue reflection and discussion on racial inequality. At Burlington, we are fortunate to have a diverse community of associates and customers. We are very proud and appreciative of this diversity. We have used the time over the last couple of months to challenge ourselves on what additional things we can be doing to further promote equity, inclusion and diversity within Burlington and in the communities in which we operate. With input and ideas from associates around the company, we have put together a program that includes some short-term actions thus more importantly includes processes and resources that will support other longer-term initiatives. We do not have all of the nuances, but we are committed to confronting the difficult questions. My reason for raising this topic in this forum is that I know that there are several investors listening to this call who share our passion to drive positive change on these very important issues. My purpose is to make you aware of our commitments and also to imbibe any of you who are interested in hearing more about our equity inclusion and diversity initiatives to reach out to me, John or David. Now, I would like to turn to our business update. We are going to structure this morning\u2019s discussion as follows: First, I will begin with an update on the second quarter. Second, I will talk about how we are thinking about the third quarter, and thirdly, I will offer some commentary on the longer-term outlook. I will then hand the call over to John to provide more financial details. After that, we will be happy to respond to any questions that you may have. Okay, let\u2019s start with the second quarter. There was certainly some highs and some lows in the second quarter. We began re-opening stores in the middle of May and by the end of June we had re-opened all but a sample of our stores. Following the re-opening of our stores, we experienced an exceptionally strong sales trend, driven by pent-up demand and by our own great [Indiscernible]. This strong sales trend continues into the second half of June, but then fell off dramatically as we struggled to replenish the depleted inventory levels in our stores. I realized that by now this is a familiar narrative; our off-price peers have described a similar pattern. But I would say that we probably experienced more significant highs and lows than they did, our trajectory was more V shaped if you like. There were several reasons for this. We started off with leaner inventories in our stores. We were more aggressive in clearing aged merchandise, and we had lower patent hold inventory to fall back on. Given all these factors, it might be helpful to provide some additional color on how the quarter unfolded month-by-month. When we first re-opened stores in May, we saw very quickly the traffic and sales levels were well ahead of our expectations. So we moved very fast to fund our buyers and to go back into the marketplace. We were probably one of the first retailers to go back into the market to buy goods. At that point, we saw tremendous availability across merchandise categories. And merchants were able to buy merchandise at really terrific values. In May and June, we wrote hundreds of millions of dollars of orders. At that point in the quarter, we were flying. We were exactly where we wanted to be. Strong sales trend, a lot of liquidity and a huge availability of merchandise. In normal times, as an off-price retailer, those are all the things that you want. The trouble of course, is that these are not normal times. Although we had written the orders, and had bought the merchandise, some of our vendors struggled to deliver the receipts as quickly as we needed them. They themselves were coming back from a standing start, bringing their own distribution facilities back up to life. The newly purchased merchandise receipts only started to flow in earnest in July. This was later than we needed, and it meant that from late June to mid-July, the inventory levels in our stores fell well below acceptable levels. This was very frustrating. We could see the sell-through that we were getting, or the limited receipts that were arriving in stores. So we know that we left significant sales dollars on the table. Since mid-July, we have brought inventory levels back up, but candidly, it has taken a lot longer than we would have wanted. Some of our vendors are still having issues with their distribution systems. In addition, like a lot of other retailers, we have run into staffing issues getting our own distribution centers up to full capacity. With all that said, as inventory levels have increased since mid-July, we have seen a significant improvement in our trend. Let me offer up some data. For inventory flow, we prioritize the stores that reopened in May. That was just over half the chain. These stores are now at approximately the inventory level that we want. Their sales levels are trending down approximately 20% but are on an improving trajectory. The rest of the chain is a couple of weeks behind. We don't know where the sales trend will settle out, once inventory levels are where we want you to be, but we are pleased with the improvement we have seen since mid-July. That is all that I can say about Q2 in my prepared remarks. I would like to move on now to talk about Q3. I don't think you will be surprised to hear me say that the upcoming quarter is extremely unpredictable. Back-to-school has been delayed, and may not happen at all. Federal unemployment assistance has come to an end, or came to an end at the beginning of the quarter. And it's unclear what if any additional stimulus spending there will be. And of course, there is continuing uncertainty and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, with many experts predicting that there could be another resurgence in the fall. This is about as unpredictable a quarter as I can ever remember. But let me give you a sense of how we are thinking about and managing the quarter. We have what I will call a baseline plan, which currently assumes that comp sales will be down about 20% for the quarter. Let me explain what this baseline plan is. We use it to manage and control receipts and expenses. It is not intended to be a reliable prediction of what is going to happen, but rather a baseline to manage against. We review this plan every week and we adjust the plan up or down based on changes in the sales trends or the outlook. In this environment, our approach is to manage our business conservatively, control liquidity, manage expenses, and be ready to change the business or to pull back based on the sales trend and external developments. The other point that I would like to make is that this may be what life is going to be like for a while. With this level of uncertainty, it is very challenging to plan and manage the business. But we have to assume that the underlying drivers of this uncertainty are not going to go away in the third quarter. In fact, they could continue for the next several quarters, and possibly while into next year. Obviously, we would like for things to normalize sooner, but we need to be prepared, and we need to recognize that this uncertainty could continue for some time. Let me -- from that point to talk about the longer term outlook. Our assessment is that the retail industry has been undergoing a significant restructuring for some years now, and that this started long before the pandemic. We believe that the two principal underlying drivers of this industry restructuring are the consumers need and desire growing need and desire for value and separately, the growth of e-commerce. We believe that both of these trends undermine the viability of traditional department store and specialty retailers, and that they have been forcing these retailers to adapt to rationalize and to close stores. The strategic implications for off-price are twofold. First of all, the consumer need value has naturally been driving market share gains to off-price for many years. More recently, the growth of e-commerce has been a third of the catalyst for this growth. As the growth of e-commerce has driven other retailers to close even more physical locations, many of the more value oriented shoppers from these stores have made their way to off-price. That is why off-price retail has been growing over the last several years in parallel with the growth of e-commerce. In the categories that we sell and at the price points that we offer, it is very difficult for e-commerce to satisfy the needs of the value conscious shopper, so as a result off-price retail has been gaining market share. We do not anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic reversing or diminishing these trends. In fact, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath is more likely to enhance the strategic trends that I have just described, by creating an even stronger consumer and economic need for value, and by driving more closures of competitive bricks and mortar retail stores. We think it is possible, but this will create an even bigger market share opportunity for price retail. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation that in the short term, possibly for the next several quarters, a situation that will be very uncomfortable and challenging for all of us to manage through. But for the reasons that I've described, we believe that once we get to the other side, the longer term market share opportunities for off-price retail that will be greater than they were before. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials.\nJohn Crimmins: Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the second quarter, total sales decreased 39%, sales in reopened stores decreased 14%. Sales in re-open stores includes all stores that were open prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and reports of the sales increase or decrease at these stores for the days the stores were opened in the second quarter against sales to the same days in the prior year. As Michael discussed, our sales trends varied across the quarter, driven by the timing of our store re-openings. Generally, as our stores reopen, sales were very strong, driven by pent up demand and our aggressive clearance markdowns. Sales were stronger than we expected during the first weeks after re-opening, and then they weakened significantly, as inventory levels were depleted. It took longer for us to re-establish appropriate inventory levels than we would have liked for the reasons Michael discussed. And this hurt our sales performance. But as inventory levels increased, and began to return to targeted levels we did see sales trends improve. This really began in mid-July and has continued into August. As expected, the sales decline was driven by significant decreases in traffic and AUR reflecting our clearance pricing, which was partially offset by increases in average transaction value and units per transaction driven by the great values we offered. The gross margin rate was 45.8%, an increase of 440 basis points versus last year's rate of 41.4%. The clearance markdowns taken during the second quarter were funded by the markdown reserve we established in the first quarter. Lower levels of clearance in the second half of the quarter resulted in lower markdowns and the increase in gross margin for the quarter. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were $72 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $82 million last year. The decrease in product sourcing costs was driven by the decrease in receipt processing activity during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $402 million versus $441 million last year. The dollar decrease was primarily due to decreases in store payroll, marketing and corporate costs, while our stores were closed, partially offset by COVID related expenses and store reopening costs of about $37 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding favorable lease costs increased $2 million to $54 million. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $181 million to a negative $63 million driven primarily by the lower sales volume. Net interest expense excluding the $7 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes was $21 million, an increase of $7 million over the last year\u2019s second quarter. The adjusted effective tax benefit rate was 55.6% for the second quarter versus last year\u2019s second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 12.8%. The tax benefit rate is the result of current year losses and carry-back provisions allowing refunds for previously filed returns at a 35% rate. Additionally, the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options increased the income tax benefit this year compared to decreasing income tax expense in the prior year. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, we have 348 million remaining on our share repurchase program, which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share loss of $0.71 versus income of $1 26 last year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were a loss of $0.56, versus a profit of $1 36 per share last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, $250 million in borrowings on our ABL, base value of $805 million in convertible notes, and $300 million in senior secured notes. We had an unused ABL availability of approximately $120 million. During the second quarter, we paid down $150 million on our ABL facility. We ended the period with total balance sheet debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Merchandise inventories were $608 million versus $824 million last year, a 26% decrease. The decrease was driven by our clearance liquidation and delayed inventory replenishment, as well as by our conservative approach to planning in this uncertain environment. Pack and hold inventory was 26% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from 29% last year. During the quarter, we opened three new stores bringing our total store count to 739 stores. At the end of the quarter 11 of these stores were temporarily closed due to a variety of factors, including five stores that sustained damages that will reopen over the next several months. Three temporary COVID related closings and three stores closed that are associated with our store relocation strategy that are re-opening later in the fall. In the third quarter, we expect to open 37 new stores with seven expected closings or relocations. In fiscal 2020, we now expect to open 62 new stores and close or relocate 26 stores. This would translate to 36 net new stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2020. As we discussed on last quarters call, eight stores shifted from spring 2020 to fall 2020 and 16 stores were shifting from fall 2020 to the spring of 2021. During the second quarter, we made the decision to shift two additional stores from fall 2020 to spring 2021 to decide -- to site availability issues outside of our control, resulting in a total of 18 stores shifting to the spring of 2021. Net capital expenditures were $121 million for the first half of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are still planned to be approximately $260 million net of landlord allowances for fiscal 2020. In terms of our fiscal 2020 to date performance, total sales declined 45%. Gross margin was 26.4% as a percentage of sales versus 41.2% last year. Product sourcing costs were $147 million versus $161 million last year. Adjusted SG&A was $796 million this year versus $869 million last year. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $801 million to a loss of $565 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding favorable lease costs increased by $6 million to $109 million. Net interest expense excluding the 9 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes increased $7 million to $33 million. The adjusted effective tax benefit rate was 41.1% as compared to last year's adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4%. Combined, this resulted in a net loss of $381 million and an adjusted net loss of $352 million versus an adjusted net income of $177 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were a loss of $5.79 versus a profit of $2.40 last year. Diluted adjusted net earnings per share were a loss of $5.36, versus a profit of $2 62 last year. Our fully diluted shares outstanding was 65.8 million shares versus 67.5 million last year. Cash flow provided by operations decreased 702 million to a negative 473 million for the first six months of 2020, driven by lower net income and changes in working capital. Net capital expenditures were 120 million -- for the 121 million for the period. Now, I will turn to some comments on our outlook. As Michael described earlier, sales for Q3 is extremely difficult to forecast. Accordingly, our guidance for sales and earnings remains suspended at this time. Given this uncertainty, we are planning the business conservatively and keeping tight control over liquidity, inventory and expenses. This posture gives us the flexibility to promote liquidity and open the buy standpoint, to flex up our receipts and opportunistic purchases if we see a strong sales trend and outlook. As described previously, total inventories were down 26% at the end of Q2. We are planning in-store inventories to remain well below last year\u2019s levels. We would expect them to be down about 20% to 25% on a comp store basis by the end of Q3, but we anticipate at the end of the quarter, total inventories may be closer to flat versus last year, driven by increased reserve inventory, specifically spring and summer pack and hold, which may grow significantly. This will depend on availability and the merchants being able to find great deals in the market. While we were not prepared to give specific sales and earnings guidance, due to the uncertainty of the current environment, we can update you as we did last quarter on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items that may be useful for modeling purposes. Capital expenditures net of landlord allowances are still expected to be approximately $260 million. We now expect to open 62 new stores, while relocating or closing 26 stores for a total of 36 net new stores in fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favorable lease costs is still expected to be approximately $230 million. In interest expense, excluding $24 million and non-cash interest on the convertible notes, is still expected to be approximately $80 million. Before I turn the call back over to Michael, I would like to mention that last week the company released its 2019 CSR report, which can now be found on our Investor Relations website burlingtoninvestors.com. This report highlights our focus on the environmental, social and governance or ESG issues of greatest importance to our stakeholders. Although this is only our second annual report, we are pleased with the progress we've made and the path we are planning for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to thank all of our associates at Burlington. We were operating in the midst of a global health crisis. And we recognize that this is a difficult and anxious time for everyone. I am tremendously proud and thankful to all of our associates for their hard work and commitment over the past several months. As I described earlier, I believe, we will emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever. There's a lot of uncertainty, but we are well positioned to absorb the shocks and to take advantage of the great opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. And, good morning. Michael, so it sounds like things were going well to start the second quarter. And then you ran into logistical rather than merchandise availability issues when you tried to replenish your store level inventories. I guess is that the right way to think about it? And can you elaborate on the issues and to what degree have the logistical issues been resolved at this point?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Matt. Thank you for -- thank you for the question. Yes, that's right. The way that you characterize what happened is accurate. Our performance in Q2 was not driven by merchandise availability. There was plenty of availability. As I described in my remarks, we turned our clearance inventory very rapidly. So in late May, we were able to go back into the market and take advantage of some terrific buying opportunities. We were very pleased with the availability that we saw, and we were able to make some great deals. The problem was that having written the orders having bought the goods, we could not get the receipts to the stores as fast as we needed. Many vendors were struggling with their own warehouse operations and getting them up and running. So we really needed to merchandise that we really needed to flow to stores in June. We weren't able to get to stores until July. That delay in receipts was a matter of weeks, but it meant that inventory levels fell well below where it needed it to be. I would say that since then, it's taken us a lot longer than it normally would to get through the receipt backlog. In the areas where VCs [ph] are located, we've seen staffing shortages. And that has hindered our ability to get our own facilities upto full capacity. [Indiscernible] the last part of your question, when these issues have been resolved. I would say that, yes, largely, they've been resolved. Our vendor\u2019s distribution facilities are up and running. And for some weeks, we've had -- we've been getting a very good flow of receipts. That said, there are lingering issues. To be clear, these issues are not specific to Burlington. I would say they run across the industry, and distribution facilities have ramped up. There have been significant staffing shortages in major distribution hubs like Southern California. Those are -- those issues are subsiding, but they haven't completely gone away. In fact, I would say that there's a risk that they could cause additional problems as retailers start to ramp up in the fall for holiday. I'd also anticipate that those issues are going to lead to an increase in supply chain costs across the retail industry.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then to follow up, Michael, when would you expect inventories to be back to the levels where you would ideally want them? And how will you manage inventories going forward?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: You know, as I -- as I mentioned earlier, if the stores that reopened in May, so just over half of our stores. We\u2019re pretty much already there in terms of getting inventory levels where we want them to be, stores that we re-opened in June, should catch up in the next couple of weeks. To be clear, though, even at that point, we're going to manage our inventory levels in our stores conservatively. As you'll probably recall, when we came into the year, our inventories were down about 15% on a comp store basis. And that was deliberate. We've historically carried more inventory than our peers and we believe that we have the opportunity to turn our inventories faster than we have in the past. And as a reminder, before the pandemic hit in mid-March, we were running about 3% comparable store sales growth. And that was with our inventories down 15%. At that point, we had said that we would, we would manage our inventories down low double-digit throughout the year. But with all the uncertainty that we now face, we're going to manage them slightly more conservatively than that. And of course, we'll be ready to flex up or flex down as best we can, depending on the trend. Final point to make about inventory though is that apart from the level, the content of our inventory is very different to last year. And, because of what happened in Q2, we have very little aged inventory left in our assortment, we have -- we have hardly any spring merchandise left in our assortment, and hardly any clearance left in our assortment. It's all fresh, seasonally, appropriate merchandise. So if the customer wants to shop computery we feel that she's going to -- what you\u2019ll find in our stores is pretty good. The trend is there, which we should do, we should do well.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Best of luck.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, everyone thanks so much for all the detail. My first question, Michael, could you give us an update on the off price for potential strategy that you've laid out in the past? And then I'm just really curious has the pandemic changed the way you're thinking about the opportunities or the strategy, and has it in any way kind of slowed down your ability to make progress on that strategy?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. It's a good question. As I described in my earlier remarks, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to create an even stronger consumer need and desire for value. And it's also likely to increase the number and the pace of competitive store closures. So if both of those things turn out to happen, then the pandemic could actually increase the longer term market share opportunity for off-price. But let me transition from talking about off-price generically to talking about Burlington specifically. As we've discussed on previous calls we\u2019re the smallest and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. And because of this, we believe that by executing the model more effectively, we can drive significant growth in sales and profitability over the next several years. In other words, we believe, we have significant upside potential. I and the rest of the executive team recognize that it would be very easy in the current environment to focus only on the short term challenges that we face. But that would be a mistake. The important goal here is to come out of all this much stronger than we went into it. So it's important that we build and prepare for the longer term and for the significant opportunity that we see ahead of us, and that I had articulated a moment ago. So over the last several months, we've been pushing forward on a number of initiatives that together form what we're calling Burlington 2.0. Our offer price for potential strategies. As we talked about on previous calls, the initiative behind Burlington 2.0 are intended to accomplish a number of things; specifically to drive a much greater focus on merchandised value, to build more check into the business so we can better respond to sales trends, to invest in and strengthen emerging capabilities, to place greater emphasis on opportunistic buying, and also to increase the flexibility of our operations. So we can respond to sudden changes in the business and making progress on all of those areas. It's going to take, take some time, going to take some investments and careful planning. But over the last few months, I would say that there's been some great work and some excellent progress. The whole organization is very energized, very focused on Burlington 2.0. The other point that I would make and to be clear, I would, I would not have wished it this way. But the last few months have provided what the -- what the U.S. military might call a live fire exercise in many of these areas. The opportunities and the challenges that we faced in the second quarter, I would say forced a faster pace of change and innovation than we might otherwise have achieved. It's true, necessity is the mother of invention. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. Clearly, this was a frustrating quarter. It did not turn out the way that we would have wanted. But we made -- we made some mistakes and we learned some important lessons, particularly in planning, buying, distribution and transportation. And I'm determined that we're going to benefit from those lessons going forward.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks, Michael. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow up for John. Any details, I know it's a unique quarter. But any details of some inputs and takes of operating margin that took place in the second quarter? And then if there's anything we should keep in mind, going forward in the back half would be great?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for your question. Yes, there was a lot of stuff going on, lots of puts and takes during the quarter. So I'll try and walk you through how we think about it as we plan and manage our expenses. So, biggest thing that happened in the quarter was the reduction in our sales volume. And obviously, that drives deleverage on our fixed cost base. So that's the single biggest driver, and that's probably kind of the way you might expect it to be. But normally, you would expect all of our volume related expenses to flex kind of in line with sales. But for a number of reasons, that wasn't really the case in the second quarter. So let me just talk about some of those things. So first, our sales decrease included huge clearance markdowns, which helped us to successfully clear our inventory and which was our primary objective. But it also meant we had more units per dollar, which of course drove worst leverage than you would normally expect in processing the units, particularly in selling costs. As I mentioned earlier, in our prepared remarks, COVID related costs and reopening costs added about $37 million to our expenses in the second quarter. So COVID related costs would include the cost of personal protective equipment, additional cleaning, additional store staffing, including front door ambassadors, signage, supplies and other costs to support social distancing procedures within our stores. And you have to kind of support our most important priority, which was ensuring that our customers and our associates would have a consistently safe welcoming and comfortable place to work or to shop. The store reopening costs include everything related to preparing our stores to open back up after the extended closures. And that includes training, training for our teams on new safety protocols and procedures, resetting our floors and traffic patterns to support social distancing prepping our merchandise for the clearance offering as well as signage and other promotional materials related to the terrific clearance values that we put on offer. We also had some incremental costs during the quarter as we work to accelerate supply chain processing and merchandise deliveries, to our stores to try and replenish as quick as we could our depleted inventory situation. As Michael mentioned, this included some additional pressure on DC. There were some wage incentives we put in place to attract more DC workers, and try to improve the throughput at our DCs during the quarter. Also, you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we plan to make some strategic investments this year in our business consistent with our Burlington 2.0 full potential strategy. As Michael just discussed, we're -- moving ahead on that, despite the conditions that we're facing. We had expected to cover these incremental investments with offsetting expenses during the year. So we're continuing to make these investments, but during the second quarter, they weren't fully offset by expense savings. Now, when the pandemic is behind us, we do expect the on-going investments will be offset by the expense savings as we originally planned. So just one of the unique things, we decided to continue these investments, but we had cost increases in some of the areas that we would have been able to manage to kind of offset them. So, while most of the deleverage was based on the smaller sales against in our fixed cost base. We did have these other things going on that made the leverage maybe a little bit worse than otherwise would have been.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks, guys. Thanks a lot.\nJohn Crimmins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJohn Kernan: Alright, good morning. Michael, I have a question just on merchandise availability beyond some of the logistical headwinds you face. It sounds like there was a lot of inventory availability early on in the quarter. Has that changed at all? We have heard some other retailers and authorizers talk about tightening up supply. So how do you characterize this merchandise availability now?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, thank you, John. Good morning. Nice to hear from you. When we started buying again in May, there was there was strong availability, I would say, in almost all areas. You know, physical retail stores have been shut since March. So, so vendors, many vendors were sitting on a lot of cancelled orders. We were able to take advantage of that situation. And we made some really, really great deals. As I explained in my prepared remarks, the issues that we ran into in Q2, were driven by logistics for want of a better word, they had nothing at all to do with availability of merchandise, at least nothing to do with availability in the sense that we normally think of it. Anyway, just to come back to your question, we're now in late August, so three months on, and I would say that there's still a plentiful supply of merchandise, but there are pockets where we're tightened. And I would probably point at two areas where that happened. First of all, businesses where consumer demand has been the strongest, specifically, certain categories, not all but certain categories in home. And secondly, in some seasonal businesses where factory shutdowns earlier this year back in February, March means that there\u2019s now limited inventory of that in those categories. You know, other than those two areas, I would say there's still plenty of merchandise available. The important thing I think, to understand about availability, merchandise availability, in off-price is that it's a function not only of how much merchandise has actually been produced, but it's also a function of what is happening to the sales growth [ph] in department stores and other retailers. Even if vendors have produced less merchandise this year and I'm sure for many vendors that can be the case. We may still see significant off-price availability, if the retailers that those goods were made for experience an even weaker trend than they had expected. Given some of the weakness that's been reported, and certainly given some of the uncertainty that's out there, it's possible, even likely that this will happen. And if it does happen, it could drive additional merchandise supply into the off-price channel. It's a good example of that, maybe back-to-school. The production of many, many back-to-school categories was constrained earlier this year due to the impact of COVID-19 in Asia. I actually remember having meetings back in February and March before the pandemic hit the U.S. where people were raising concerns about the supply of back-to-school categories. Now, depending on how things unfold over the next few weeks, the level of demand in these categories across retail could be even less than was produced. So if things turn out that way, that could generate additional price supply. And in our case, that would mean, that we might take advantage of for pack and hold. And actually let me just wrap up that the question by talking a little more about pack and hold. We anticipate that there may be an opportunity over the coming months to significantly increase our spring and summer pack and hold inventory levels. We've actually expanded our warehousing storage capacity to support that. But the extent to which it happens, all depends on the kind of deals that you see. As you'd expect, we\u2019ll only pack the way the very best \u2013 that our merchants can buy.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe just a quick follow up. You mentioned that [Indiscernible] that still sounds pretty difficult from availability standpoint, how are the other categories affecting your business and just the general buying decisions?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, it's a really good question. Clearly, since we emerged from the lockdown, the customer has not allocated her spending evenly across merchandise areas. This is different to what's happened in the past. For example, in the period after the financial crisis, as the consumer started spending again, the increase in spending was much more evenly across categories and across businesses. This time, more so than any period I can remember. There's been a massive shift in spending between categories. So what does that shift look like? Well, you've heard from other retailers and obviously I already just talked about a very strong consumer demand for many home related businesses. In terms of the rest of the store, within ready-to-wear there's been a significant shift, towards more casual and active classifications. And therefore away from more formal structured dressier businesses. Now, I think those trends make intuitive sense, at least in the short term. You know, people are working from home, maybe they're sheltering at home, but they're certainly going out a lot less. Now for us, those trends represent those category trends represent a challenge and an opportunity. Some of the areas that have experienced the strongest growth in demand or businesses where frankly, we're less developed than some of our competitors and the best example being home, but also some casual classifications within ready-to-wear. And so ever since we\u2019ve been buying again, ever since May and certainly, as we've been building back our inventories, we've been aggressively going after those businesses. So we feel like we have an opportunity to grow those undeveloped categories, but we would acknowledge that we're starting from a -- from a weaker position relative to some of our peers.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson : Thanks. Good morning. John, how should we think about your operating margin and financial model going forward? Have there been any structural changes to your expenses?\nJohn Crimmins: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for your question. Yes, I think the quick answer to that is no. We don't really see any permanent structural changes to expense to our expense base, or how we think about our operating margin expansion opportunity going forward. But I guess the biggest impact to our operating margin that we've seen, has been driven by the just big decline in sales that we've experienced so far. We do expect that post pandemic, sales are going to normalize. And we expect like a terrific opportunity to add to our market share driving comp sales. And we're going to continue to aggressively expand our fleet of stores. Most of the additional expenses that we've seen -- I\u2019ve talked about this a little bit to your next question. They're transitory. They are caused by pandemic related events. We don't expect them to continue, but it should be behind us when the pandemic is behind us. Maybe the one exception there is the wage pressure for DC labor. To this point, much of what we've done to kind of attract more workers in our DCs has been more of temporary short term and hedge, short term incentives. But there's likely to be a component of this that's permanent. It's not yet clear how significant it's going to be. But as you know, we face wage headwinds every year, and we've had a pretty good history of finding ways to offset their impact and deliver operating margin expansion. So, when this thing is behind us, we do expect to have the kind of same type of operating margin opportunity that we had prior to it.\nLorraine Hutchinson : Thanks. And just a follow up. I know you suspended guidance, and there's a lot of uncertainty. That said, can you give us some direction or color on how we should think about margins in the second half of fiscal 20?\nJohn Crimmins: Sure, it's really hard to forecast anything, so I'm going to stay away from numbers, but we do have some color that, I think might be helpful. So for gross margin, we think that's going to be relatively stable in the second half of the year. If you think about merch margin, our inventories are really clean coming out of the second quarter as clean as we have ever seen them. So any markdowns going forward are going to be based on how well we were able to balance the flow of inventory with the sales trends, same challenge we have all the time, just a little bit more volatile this year. SG&A in the second half is going to continue to be impacted by COVID related expenses in a similar way to the second quarter, but not exactly the same. We expect COVID related costs to be higher, kind of moving along the sales volume and increased traffic that we expect and hope to see in our stores in the second half. But, we don't expect to be incurring the store re-opening costs, at least we hope we won't be, at least to the degree that we have them in the first half of the year when all of our stores were closed and then reopened. So we're not going to give up a number expected for the COVID related costs in the second half, because it's really difficult to project, but there would be some, kind of deleverage pressure as we continue with the costs related to keeping our stores safe and comfortable for shoppers and associates. Product sourcing costs as a percentage of sales, we do expect a little bit of deleverage pressure in the second half, for a few reasons. You already mentioned the DC labor shortage, which slightly is likely going to drive some incremental costs. We're also going to see, we believe, some downward pressure on AUR. Part of that's driven by better buying, allowing us to pass more value to our customers. And some of it is going to be related to category of mix changes. And there could be some other pressure as we continue to improve, work on improving our ability to get goods to our stores faster and keep inventory at the right levels. Obviously, the sales volume in Q3 and Q4 is going to have an impact on our product sourcing costs leverage, so it's difficult to pinpoint. But directionally that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Overall, given our conservative inventory planning and the potential for continued depress sales levels, we\u2019re going to expect continue deleverage on expenses. The magnitude is obviously dependent on our ability to perform as well as we can on the sales line. But as I said earlier, we think that most of the deleveraging factors we face this year are temporary. And then post pandemic, our model is going to turn back to what it was prior to the pandemic.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Hofkin: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, if I could just asked one. First question then a quick follow up. My first question is I think your description of how you're thinking about the third quarter makes a lot of sense. I was just curious, though, do you think there is a risk of being potentially too conservative? And, in the process, possibly missing a sales opportunity? If you have to chase, too much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Daniel. I would say that the short answer to your question is, yes. There is absolutely a risk with that. You follow off-price for a while so you'll know that the playbook, off-price is to plan sales conservatively, but be liquid and ready to chase the trend. That approach has worked very effectively, very well historically. And it's given off-price retailers significance over other retail formats. But I would say that the current environment presents a couple of important challenges to executing that playbook. Firstly, the range of possible outcomes over the next month is much wider than we've had to deal with in the past. At the extremes, I could describe a scenario where there's a further resurgence in COVID-19 in the fall, and potentially that could lead to further local or even regional lockdowns. And then perhaps the other extreme, I could, I could describe a scenario where the number of COVID-19 cases declines over the next few months. And also, as part of that scenario, perhaps the federal government reaches a compromise and passes a stimulus package that drives consumer spending. My point is that we need to be ready to either of those scenarios, so a very wide range of outcomes. Add to that, there may be external constraints, like, some of the industry supply chain issues that we ran into in Q2. If those were to recur, they would they would hamper our ability nicely, they would hamper the ability of all retailers to chase sales in the fall. Of course, the very fact that I'm articulating these risks means that we're aware of them, and we're taking the steps that we can to investigate them. But nevertheless, I think your question is a good one. You know, is there a possibility that we'll leave sales on the table? Yes. In this environment there is a chance of that. There is a broader point that I would like to make before leaving this question. One of the things that we're mindful of within Burlington is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Now, of course, we're competitive. We'd like to do well. We'd love to maximize sales in every quarter. But we also need to be little bit capital and to make sure that we prudently navigate our way through this uncertain period. As I said in my earlier remarks, we expect that the next few quarters could be like this, could be difficult, could be uncomfortable. So I guess, I'd summarize out our game plan, in this situation. A game plan if you like it, you know, having two parts to it. Number one, part number one, you manage the business prudently remain as flexible as possible, that we can chase sales as best we can, or if we can pull back based upon the trend. And then part number two, continue to aggressively push forward on the major elements of our Burlington 2.0 off-price for potential strategy. We know, I think we all know that long term success is not going to be defined by the next couple of quarters. Long term success will be defined by what the world looks like coming out of the pandemic. And the degree to which we're ready at that point, and we're able to take advantage of any market share opportunities that are ahead of us.\nDaniel Hofkin: It's really helpful Thank you. And then just a very quick follow up as you know, anything, any updates, especially maybe insights related to the pandemic in problems that you're seeing and some full price retail of different types that is updating you are thinking on the real estate strategy or opportunity for you guys and in the right size store, etcetera overtime. Thank you very much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, that's a good thing. It kind of feeds into making sure that we keep an eye on the longer term because key part of our Burlington 2.0 strategy over the next few years is to continue to expand our stores, and continue to right size our stores so we can drive store power activity, we can drive new store economics. So we've been over the last few months, we've been doing a lot of work. Our real estate team has done some terrific work, sort of planning out the next few years from a real estate point of view. And I think what you're alluding to and I agree with you, is I feel like, given what's happening in broader retail, we are likely to see significant additional real estate opportunities open up, which we will be able to take advantage of maybe as soon as late 2021. But certainly, we would hope in 2022, 2023. So that's absolutely something we are looking at, and actually excited about.\nDaniel Hofkin: Thanks so much. Best of luck for everything.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Michael O\u2019Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the questions. We look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of November to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. For the second quarter, total sales decreased 39%, sales in reopened stores decreased 14%. Sales in re-open stores includes all stores that were open prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and reports of the sales increase or decrease at these stores for the days the stores were opened in the second quarter against sales to the same days in the prior year. As Michael discussed, our sales trends varied across the quarter, driven by the timing of our store re-openings. Generally, as our stores reopen, sales were very strong, driven by pent up demand and our aggressive clearance markdowns. Sales were stronger than we expected during the first weeks after re-opening, and then they weakened significantly, as inventory levels were depleted. It took longer for us to re-establish appropriate inventory levels than we would have liked for the reasons Michael discussed. And this hurt our sales performance. But as inventory levels increased, and began to return to targeted levels we did see sales trends improve. This really began in mid-July and has continued into August. As expected, the sales decline was driven by significant decreases in traffic and AUR reflecting our clearance pricing, which was partially offset by increases in average transaction value and units per transaction driven by the great values we offered. The gross margin rate was 45.8%, an increase of 440 basis points versus last year's rate of 41.4%. The clearance markdowns taken during the second quarter were funded by the markdown reserve we established in the first quarter. Lower levels of clearance in the second half of the quarter resulted in lower markdowns and the increase in gross margin for the quarter. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were $72 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $82 million last year. The decrease in product sourcing costs was driven by the decrease in receipt processing activity during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A was $402 million versus $441 million last year. The dollar decrease was primarily due to decreases in store payroll, marketing and corporate costs, while our stores were closed, partially offset by COVID related expenses and store reopening costs of about $37 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding favorable lease costs increased $2 million to $54 million. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $181 million to a negative $63 million driven primarily by the lower sales volume. Net interest expense excluding the $7 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes was $21 million, an increase of $7 million over the last year's second quarter. The adjusted effective tax benefit rate was 55.6% for the second quarter versus last year's second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 12.8%. The tax benefit rate is the result of current year losses and carry-back provisions allowing refunds for previously filed returns at a 35% rate. Additionally, the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options increased the income tax benefit this year compared to decreasing income tax expense in the prior year. We did not repurchase stock during the quarter, we have 348 million remaining on our share repurchase program, which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share loss of $0.71 versus income of $1 26 last year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were a loss of $0.56, versus a profit of $1 36 per share last year. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, $250 million in borrowings on our ABL, base value of $805 million in convertible notes, and $300 million in senior secured notes. We had an unused ABL availability of approximately $120 million. During the second quarter, we paid down $150 million on our ABL facility. We ended the period with total balance sheet debt of approximately $2.2 billion. Merchandise inventories were $608 million versus $824 million last year, a 26% decrease. The decrease was driven by our clearance liquidation and delayed inventory replenishment, as well as by our conservative approach to planning in this uncertain environment. Pack and hold inventory was 26% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from 29% last year. During the quarter, we opened three new stores bringing our total store count to 739 stores. At the end of the quarter 11 of these stores were temporarily closed due to a variety of factors, including five stores that sustained damages that will reopen over the next several months. Three temporary COVID related closings and three stores closed that are associated with our store relocation strategy that are re-opening later in the fall. In the third quarter, we expect to open 37 new stores with seven expected closings or relocations. In fiscal 2020, we now expect to open 62 new stores and close or relocate 26 stores. This would translate to 36 net new stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2020. As we discussed on last quarters call, eight stores shifted from spring 2020 to fall 2020 and 16 stores were shifting from fall 2020 to the spring of 2021. During the second quarter, we made the decision to shift two additional stores from fall 2020 to spring 2021 to decide -- to site availability issues outside of our control, resulting in a total of 18 stores shifting to the spring of 2021. Net capital expenditures were $121 million for the first half of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are still planned to be approximately $260 million net of landlord allowances for fiscal 2020. In terms of our fiscal 2020 to date performance, total sales declined 45%. Gross margin was 26.4% as a percentage of sales versus 41.2% last year. Product sourcing costs were $147 million versus $161 million last year. Adjusted SG&A was $796 million this year versus $869 million last year. Adjusted EBIT decreased by $801 million to a loss of $565 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding favorable lease costs increased by $6 million to $109 million. Net interest expense excluding the 9 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes increased $7 million to $33 million. The adjusted effective tax benefit rate was 41.1% as compared to last year's adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4%. Combined, this resulted in a net loss of $381 million and an adjusted net loss of $352 million versus an adjusted net income of $177 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were a loss of $5.79 versus a profit of $2.40 last year. Diluted adjusted net earnings per share were a loss of $5.36, versus a profit of $2 62 last year. Our fully diluted shares outstanding was 65.8 million shares versus 67.5 million last year. Cash flow provided by operations decreased 702 million to a negative 473 million for the first six months of 2020, driven by lower net income and changes in working capital. Net capital expenditures were 120 million -- for the 121 million for the period. Now, I will turn to some comments on our outlook. As Michael described earlier, sales for Q3 is extremely difficult to forecast. Accordingly, our guidance for sales and earnings remains suspended at this time. Given this uncertainty, we are planning the business conservatively and keeping tight control over liquidity, inventory and expenses. This posture gives us the flexibility to promote liquidity and open the buy standpoint, to flex up our receipts and opportunistic purchases if we see a strong sales trend and outlook. As described previously, total inventories were down 26% at the end of Q2. We are planning in-store inventories to remain well below last year's levels. We would expect them to be down about 20% to 25% on a comp store basis by the end of Q3, but we anticipate at the end of the quarter, total inventories may be closer to flat versus last year, driven by increased reserve inventory, specifically spring and summer pack and hold, which may grow significantly. This will depend on availability and the merchants being able to find great deals in the market. While we were not prepared to give specific sales and earnings guidance, due to the uncertainty of the current environment, we can update you as we did last quarter on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items that may be useful for modeling purposes. Capital expenditures net of landlord allowances are still expected to be approximately $260 million. We now expect to open 62 new stores, while relocating or closing 26 stores for a total of 36 net new stores in fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense, exclusive of favorable lease costs is still expected to be approximately $230 million. In interest expense, excluding $24 million and non-cash interest on the convertible notes, is still expected to be approximately $80 million. Before I turn the call back over to Michael, I would like to mention that last week the company released its 2019 CSR report, which can now be found on our Investor Relations website burlingtoninvestors.com. This report highlights our focus on the environmental, social and governance or ESG issues of greatest importance to our stakeholders. Although this is only our second annual report, we are pleased with the progress we've made and the path we are planning for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Yes. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for your question. Yes, there was a lot of stuff going on, lots of puts and takes during the quarter. So I'll try and walk you through how we think about it as we plan and manage our expenses. So, biggest thing that happened in the quarter was the reduction in our sales volume. And obviously, that drives deleverage on our fixed cost base. So that's the single biggest driver, and that's probably kind of the way you might expect it to be. But normally, you would expect all of our volume related expenses to flex kind of in line with sales. But for a number of reasons, that wasn't really the case in the second quarter. So let me just talk about some of those things. So first, our sales decrease included huge clearance markdowns, which helped us to successfully clear our inventory and which was our primary objective. But it also meant we had more units per dollar, which of course drove worst leverage than you would normally expect in processing the units, particularly in selling costs. As I mentioned earlier, in our prepared remarks, COVID related costs and reopening costs added about $37 million to our expenses in the second quarter. So COVID related costs would include the cost of personal protective equipment, additional cleaning, additional store staffing, including front door ambassadors, signage, supplies and other costs to support social distancing procedures within our stores. And you have to kind of support our most important priority, which was ensuring that our customers and our associates would have a consistently safe welcoming and comfortable place to work or to shop. The store reopening costs include everything related to preparing our stores to open back up after the extended closures. And that includes training, training for our teams on new safety protocols and procedures, resetting our floors and traffic patterns to support social distancing prepping our merchandise for the clearance offering as well as signage and other promotional materials related to the terrific clearance values that we put on offer. We also had some incremental costs during the quarter as we work to accelerate supply chain processing and merchandise deliveries, to our stores to try and replenish as quick as we could our depleted inventory situation. As Michael mentioned, this included some additional pressure on DC. There were some wage incentives we put in place to attract more DC workers, and try to improve the throughput at our DCs during the quarter. Also, you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we plan to make some strategic investments this year in our business consistent with our Burlington 2.0 full potential strategy. As Michael just discussed, we're -- moving ahead on that, despite the conditions that we're facing. We had expected to cover these incremental investments with offsetting expenses during the year. So we're continuing to make these investments, but during the second quarter, they weren't fully offset by expense savings. Now, when the pandemic is behind us, we do expect the on-going investments will be offset by the expense savings as we originally planned. So just one of the unique things, we decided to continue these investments, but we had cost increases in some of the areas that we would have been able to manage to kind of offset them. So, while most of the deleverage was based on the smaller sales against in our fixed cost base. We did have these other things going on that made the leverage maybe a little bit worse than otherwise would have been. Thank you. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for your question. Yes, I think the quick answer to that is no. We don't really see any permanent structural changes to expense to our expense base, or how we think about our operating margin expansion opportunity going forward. But I guess the biggest impact to our operating margin that we've seen, has been driven by the just big decline in sales that we've experienced so far. We do expect that post pandemic, sales are going to normalize. And we expect like a terrific opportunity to add to our market share driving comp sales.

            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's second quarter earnings call. I hope that you are all keeping safe and well in these very challenging and difficult times. We are very glad that you could join us. Before we discuss our business results and outlook, I would like to take a moment to talk about racial justice. The cruel killing of George Floyd in May of this year triggered wide-spread protest and along overdue reflection and discussion on racial inequality. At Burlington, we are fortunate to have a diverse community of associates and customers. We are very proud and appreciative of this diversity. We have used the time over the last couple of months to challenge ourselves on what additional things we can be doing to further promote equity, inclusion and diversity within Burlington and in the communities in which we operate. With input and ideas from associates around the company, we have put together a program that includes some short-term actions thus more importantly includes processes and resources that will support other longer-term initiatives. We do not have all of the nuances, but we are committed to confronting the difficult questions. My reason for raising this topic in this forum is that I know that there are several investors listening to this call who share our passion to drive positive change on these very important issues. My purpose is to make you aware of our commitments and also to imbibe any of you who are interested in hearing more about our equity inclusion and diversity initiatives to reach out to me, John or David. Now, I would like to turn to our business update. We are going to structure this morning's discussion as follows: First, I will begin with an update on the second quarter. Second, I will talk about how we are thinking about the third quarter, and thirdly, I will offer some commentary on the longer-term outlook. I will then hand the call over to John to provide more financial details. After that, we will be happy to respond to any questions that you may have. Okay, let's start with the second quarter. There was certainly some highs and some lows in the second quarter. We began re-opening stores in the middle of May and by the end of June we had re-opened all but a sample of our stores. Following the re-opening of our stores, we experienced an exceptionally strong sales trend, driven by pent-up demand and by our own great [Indiscernible]. This strong sales trend continues into the second half of June, but then fell off dramatically as we struggled to replenish the depleted inventory levels in our stores. I realized that by now this is a familiar narrative; our off-price peers have described a similar pattern. But I would say that we probably experienced more significant highs and lows than they did, our trajectory was more V shaped if you like. There were several reasons for this. We started off with leaner inventories in our stores. We were more aggressive in clearing aged merchandise, and we had lower patent hold inventory to fall back on. Given all these factors, it might be helpful to provide some additional color on how the quarter unfolded month-by-month. When we first re-opened stores in May, we saw very quickly the traffic and sales levels were well ahead of our expectations. So we moved very fast to fund our buyers and to go back into the marketplace. We were probably one of the first retailers to go back into the market to buy goods. At that point, we saw tremendous availability across merchandise categories. And merchants were able to buy merchandise at really terrific values. In May and June, we wrote hundreds of millions of dollars of orders. At that point in the quarter, we were flying. We were exactly where we wanted to be. Strong sales trend, a lot of liquidity and a huge availability of merchandise. In normal times, as an off-price retailer, those are all the things that you want. The trouble of course, is that these are not normal times. Although we had written the orders, and had bought the merchandise, some of our vendors struggled to deliver the receipts as quickly as we needed them. They themselves were coming back from a standing start, bringing their own distribution facilities back up to life. The newly purchased merchandise receipts only started to flow in earnest in July. This was later than we needed, and it meant that from late June to mid-July, the inventory levels in our stores fell well below acceptable levels. This was very frustrating. We could see the sell-through that we were getting, or the limited receipts that were arriving in stores. So we know that we left significant sales dollars on the table. Since mid-July, we have brought inventory levels back up, but candidly, it has taken a lot longer than we would have wanted. Some of our vendors are still having issues with their distribution systems. In addition, like a lot of other retailers, we have run into staffing issues getting our own distribution centers up to full capacity. With all that said, as inventory levels have increased since mid-July, we have seen a significant improvement in our trend. Let me offer up some data. For inventory flow, we prioritize the stores that reopened in May. That was just over half the chain. These stores are now at approximately the inventory level that we want. Their sales levels are trending down approximately 20% but are on an improving trajectory. The rest of the chain is a couple of weeks behind. We don't know where the sales trend will settle out, once inventory levels are where we want you to be, but we are pleased with the improvement we have seen since mid-July. That is all that I can say about Q2 in my prepared remarks. I would like to move on now to talk about Q3. I don't think you will be surprised to hear me say that the upcoming quarter is extremely unpredictable. Back-to-school has been delayed, and may not happen at all. Federal unemployment assistance has come to an end, or came to an end at the beginning of the quarter. And it's unclear what if any additional stimulus spending there will be. And of course, there is continuing uncertainty and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, with many experts predicting that there could be another resurgence in the fall. This is about as unpredictable a quarter as I can ever remember. But let me give you a sense of how we are thinking about and managing the quarter. We have what I will call a baseline plan, which currently assumes that comp sales will be down about 20% for the quarter. Let me explain what this baseline plan is. We use it to manage and control receipts and expenses. It is not intended to be a reliable prediction of what is going to happen, but rather a baseline to manage against. We review this plan every week and we adjust the plan up or down based on changes in the sales trends or the outlook. In this environment, our approach is to manage our business conservatively, control liquidity, manage expenses, and be ready to change the business or to pull back based on the sales trend and external developments. The other point that I would like to make is that this may be what life is going to be like for a while. With this level of uncertainty, it is very challenging to plan and manage the business. But we have to assume that the underlying drivers of this uncertainty are not going to go away in the third quarter. In fact, they could continue for the next several quarters, and possibly while into next year. Obviously, we would like for things to normalize sooner, but we need to be prepared, and we need to recognize that this uncertainty could continue for some time. Let me -- from that point to talk about the longer term outlook. Our assessment is that the retail industry has been undergoing a significant restructuring for some years now, and that this started long before the pandemic. We believe that the two principal underlying drivers of this industry restructuring are the consumers need and desire growing need and desire for value and separately, the growth of e-commerce. We believe that both of these trends undermine the viability of traditional department store and specialty retailers, and that they have been forcing these retailers to adapt to rationalize and to close stores. The strategic implications for off-price are twofold. First of all, the consumer need value has naturally been driving market share gains to off-price for many years. More recently, the growth of e-commerce has been a third of the catalyst for this growth. As the growth of e-commerce has driven other retailers to close even more physical locations, many of the more value oriented shoppers from these stores have made their way to off-price. That is why off-price retail has been growing over the last several years in parallel with the growth of e-commerce. In the categories that we sell and at the price points that we offer, it is very difficult for e-commerce to satisfy the needs of the value conscious shopper, so as a result off-price retail has been gaining market share. We do not anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic reversing or diminishing these trends. In fact, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath is more likely to enhance the strategic trends that I have just described, by creating an even stronger consumer and economic need for value, and by driving more closures of competitive bricks and mortar retail stores. We think it is possible, but this will create an even bigger market share opportunity for price retail. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation that in the short term, possibly for the next several quarters, a situation that will be very uncomfortable and challenging for all of us to manage through. But for the reasons that I've described, we believe that once we get to the other side, the longer term market share opportunities for off-price retail that will be greater than they were before. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our financials. Thank you, John. As I wrap up my remarks, I would like to thank all of our associates at Burlington. We were operating in the midst of a global health crisis. And we recognize that this is a difficult and anxious time for everyone. I am tremendously proud and thankful to all of our associates for their hard work and commitment over the past several months. As I described earlier, I believe, we will emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever. There's a lot of uncertainty, but we are well positioned to absorb the shocks and to take advantage of the great opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Good morning, Matt. Thank you for -- thank you for the question. Yes, that's right. The way that you characterize what happened is accurate. Our performance in Q2 was not driven by merchandise availability. There was plenty of availability. As I described in my remarks, we turned our clearance inventory very rapidly. So in late May, we were able to go back into the market and take advantage of some terrific buying opportunities. We were very pleased with the availability that we saw, and we were able to make some great deals. The problem was that having written the orders having bought the goods, we could not get the receipts to the stores as fast as we needed. Many vendors were struggling with their own warehouse operations and getting them up and running. So we really needed to merchandise that we really needed to flow to stores in June. We weren't able to get to stores until July. That delay in receipts was a matter of weeks, but it meant that inventory levels fell well below where it needed it to be. I would say that since then, it's taken us a lot longer than it normally would to get through the receipt backlog. In the areas where VCs [ph] are located, we've seen staffing shortages. And that has hindered our ability to get our own facilities upto full capacity. [Indiscernible] the last part of your question, when these issues have been resolved. I would say that, yes, largely, they've been resolved. Our vendor's distribution facilities are up and running. And for some weeks, we've had -- we've been getting a very good flow of receipts. That said, there are lingering issues. To be clear, these issues are not specific to Burlington. I would say they run across the industry, and distribution facilities have ramped up. There have been significant staffing shortages in major distribution hubs like Southern California. Those are -- those issues are subsiding, but they haven't completely gone away. In fact, I would say that there's a risk that they could cause additional problems as retailers start to ramp up in the fall for holiday. I'd also anticipate that those issues are going to lead to an increase in supply chain costs across the retail industry. You know, as I -- as I mentioned earlier, if the stores that reopened in May, so just over half of our stores. We're pretty much already there in terms of getting inventory levels where we want them to be, stores that we re-opened in June, should catch up in the next couple of weeks. To be clear, though, even at that point, we're going to manage our inventory levels in our stores conservatively. As you'll probably recall, when we came into the year, our inventories were down about 15% on a comp store basis. And that was deliberate. We've historically carried more inventory than our peers and we believe that we have the opportunity to turn our inventories faster than we have in the past. And as a reminder, before the pandemic hit in mid-March, we were running about 3% comparable store sales growth. And that was with our inventories down 15%. At that point, we had said that we would, we would manage our inventories down low double-digit throughout the year. But with all the uncertainty that we now face, we're going to manage them slightly more conservatively than that. And of course, we'll be ready to flex up or flex down as best we can, depending on the trend. Final point to make about inventory though is that apart from the level, the content of our inventory is very different to last year. And, because of what happened in Q2, we have very little aged inventory left in our assortment, we have -- we have hardly any spring merchandise left in our assortment, and hardly any clearance left in our assortment. It's all fresh, seasonally, appropriate merchandise. So if the customer wants to shop computery we feel that she's going to -- what you'll find in our stores is pretty good. The trend is there, which we should do, we should do well. Thank you. Good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. It's a good question. As I described in my earlier remarks, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to create an even stronger consumer need and desire for value. And it's also likely to increase the number and the pace of competitive store closures. So if both of those things turn out to happen, then the pandemic could actually increase the longer term market share opportunity for off-price. But let me transition from talking about off-price generically to talking about Burlington specifically. As we've discussed on previous calls we're the smallest and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. And because of this, we believe that by executing the model more effectively, we can drive significant growth in sales and profitability over the next several years. In other words, we believe, we have significant upside potential. I and the rest of the executive team recognize that it would be very easy in the current environment to focus only on the short term challenges that we face. But that would be a mistake. The important goal here is to come out of all this much stronger than we went into it. So it's important that we build and prepare for the longer term and for the significant opportunity that we see ahead of us, and that I had articulated a moment ago. So over the last several months, we've been pushing forward on a number of initiatives that together form what we're calling Burlington 2.0. Our offer price for potential strategies. As we talked about on previous calls, the initiative behind Burlington 2.0 are intended to accomplish a number of things; specifically to drive a much greater focus on merchandised value, to build more check into the business so we can better respond to sales trends, to invest in and strengthen emerging capabilities, to place greater emphasis on opportunistic buying, and also to increase the flexibility of our operations. So we can respond to sudden changes in the business and making progress on all of those areas. It's going to take, take some time, going to take some investments and careful planning. But over the last few months, I would say that there's been some great work and some excellent progress. The whole organization is very energized, very focused on Burlington 2.0. The other point that I would make and to be clear, I would, I would not have wished it this way. But the last few months have provided what the -- what the U.S. military might call a live fire exercise in many of these areas. The opportunities and the challenges that we faced in the second quarter, I would say forced a faster pace of change and innovation than we might otherwise have achieved. It's true, necessity is the mother of invention. I'm not trying to sugarcoat it. Clearly, this was a frustrating quarter. It did not turn out the way that we would have wanted. But we made -- we made some mistakes and we learned some important lessons, particularly in planning, buying, distribution and transportation. And I'm determined that we're going to benefit from those lessons going forward. Yes, thank you, John. Good morning. Nice to hear from you. When we started buying again in May, there was there was strong availability, I would say, in almost all areas. You know, physical retail stores have been shut since March. So, so vendors, many vendors were sitting on a lot of cancelled orders. We were able to take advantage of that situation. And we made some really, really great deals. As I explained in my prepared remarks, the issues that we ran into in Q2, were driven by logistics for want of a better word, they had nothing at all to do with availability of merchandise, at least nothing to do with availability in the sense that we normally think of it. Anyway, just to come back to your question, we're now in late August, so three months on, and I would say that there's still a plentiful supply of merchandise, but there are pockets where we're tightened. And I would probably point at two areas where that happened. First of all, businesses where consumer demand has been the strongest, specifically, certain categories, not all but certain categories in home. And secondly, in some seasonal businesses where factory shutdowns earlier this year back in February, March means that there's now limited inventory of that in those categories. You know, other than those two areas, I would say there's still plenty of merchandise available. The important thing I think, to understand about availability, merchandise availability, in off-price is that it's a function not only of how much merchandise has actually been produced, but it's also a function of what is happening to the sales growth [ph] in department stores and other retailers. Even if vendors have produced less merchandise this year and I'm sure for many vendors that can be the case. We may still see significant off-price availability, if the retailers that those goods were made for experience an even weaker trend than they had expected. Given some of the weakness that's been reported, and certainly given some of the uncertainty that's out there, it's possible, even likely that this will happen. And if it does happen, it could drive additional merchandise supply into the off-price channel. It's a good example of that, maybe back-to-school. The production of many, many back-to-school categories was constrained earlier this year due to the impact of COVID-19 in Asia. I actually remember having meetings back in February and March before the pandemic hit the U.S. where people were raising concerns about the supply of back-to-school categories. Now, depending on how things unfold over the next few weeks, the level of demand in these categories across retail could be even less than was produced. So if things turn out that way, that could generate additional price supply. And in our case, that would mean, that we might take advantage of for pack and hold. And actually let me just wrap up that the question by talking a little more about pack and hold. We anticipate that there may be an opportunity over the coming months to significantly increase our spring and summer pack and hold inventory levels. We've actually expanded our warehousing storage capacity to support that. But the extent to which it happens, all depends on the kind of deals that you see. As you'd expect, we'll only pack the way the very best \u2013 that our merchants can buy. Yes, it's a really good question. Clearly, since we emerged from the lockdown, the customer has not allocated her spending evenly across merchandise areas. This is different to what's happened in the past. For example, in the period after the financial crisis, as the consumer started spending again, the increase in spending was much more evenly across categories and across businesses. This time, more so than any period I can remember. There's been a massive shift in spending between categories. So what does that shift look like? Well, you've heard from other retailers and obviously I already just talked about a very strong consumer demand for many home related businesses. In terms of the rest of the store, within ready-to-wear there's been a significant shift, towards more casual and active classifications. And therefore away from more formal structured dressier businesses. Now, I think those trends make intuitive sense, at least in the short term. You know, people are working from home, maybe they're sheltering at home, but they're certainly going out a lot less. Now for us, those trends represent those category trends represent a challenge and an opportunity. Some of the areas that have experienced the strongest growth in demand or businesses where frankly, we're less developed than some of our competitors and the best example being home, but also some casual classifications within ready-to-wear. And so ever since we've been buying again, ever since May and certainly, as we've been building back our inventories, we've been aggressively going after those businesses. So we feel like we have an opportunity to grow those undeveloped categories, but we would acknowledge that we're starting from a -- from a weaker position relative to some of our peers. Thanks, John. Good morning, Daniel. I would say that the short answer to your question is, yes. There is absolutely a risk with that. You follow off-price for a while so you'll know that the playbook, off-price is to plan sales conservatively, but be liquid and ready to chase the trend. That approach has worked very effectively, very well historically. And it's given off-price retailers significance over other retail formats. But I would say that the current environment presents a couple of important challenges to executing that playbook. Firstly, the range of possible outcomes over the next month is much wider than we've had to deal with in the past. At the extremes, I could describe a scenario where there's a further resurgence in COVID-19 in the fall, and potentially that could lead to further local or even regional lockdowns. And then perhaps the other extreme, I could, I could describe a scenario where the number of COVID-19 cases declines over the next few months. And also, as part of that scenario, perhaps the federal government reaches a compromise and passes a stimulus package that drives consumer spending. My point is that we need to be ready to either of those scenarios, so a very wide range of outcomes. Add to that, there may be external constraints, like, some of the industry supply chain issues that we ran into in Q2. If those were to recur, they would they would hamper our ability nicely, they would hamper the ability of all retailers to chase sales in the fall. Of course, the very fact that I'm articulating these risks means that we're aware of them, and we're taking the steps that we can to investigate them. But nevertheless, I think your question is a good one. You know, is there a possibility that we'll leave sales on the table? Yes. In this environment there is a chance of that. There is a broader point that I would like to make before leaving this question. One of the things that we're mindful of within Burlington is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Now, of course, we're competitive. We'd like to do well. We'd love to maximize sales in every quarter. But we also need to be little bit capital and to make sure that we prudently navigate our way through this uncertain period. As I said in my earlier remarks, we expect that the next few quarters could be like this, could be difficult, could be uncomfortable. So I guess, I'd summarize out our game plan, in this situation. A game plan if you like it, you know, having two parts to it. Number one, part number one, you manage the business prudently remain as flexible as possible, that we can chase sales as best we can, or if we can pull back based upon the trend. And then part number two, continue to aggressively push forward on the major elements of our Burlington 2.0 off-price for potential strategy. We know, I think we all know that long term success is not going to be defined by the next couple of quarters. Long term success will be defined by what the world looks like coming out of the pandemic. And the degree to which we're ready at that point, and we're able to take advantage of any market share opportunities that are ahead of us. Yes, that's a good thing. It kind of feeds into making sure that we keep an eye on the longer term because key part of our Burlington 2.0 strategy over the next few years is to continue to expand our stores, and continue to right size our stores so we can drive store power activity, we can drive new store economics. So we've been over the last few months, we've been doing a lot of work. Our real estate team has done some terrific work, sort of planning out the next few years from a real estate point of view. And I think what you're alluding to and I agree with you, is I feel like, given what's happening in broader retail, we are likely to see significant additional real estate opportunities open up, which we will be able to take advantage of maybe as soon as late 2021. But certainly, we would hope in 2022, 2023. So that's absolutely something we are looking at, and actually excited about. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the questions. We look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of November to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's first quarter earnings call. I hope that you are all safe and well in these challenging times. We are very glad that you could join us. On this morning's call, we would like to structure the discussion as follows. First, I will begin with a discussion of the first quarter. I will focus my remarks on where we ended the quarter with regard to our inventory levels and our cash position. Second, I will provide an update on the timing of our store re-openings and the initial traffic and sales levels that we are seeing. I will also describe the actions that we are taking in our stores to provide a safe environment for our associates and our customers. Third, I will describe the opportunities and the risks that we may face over the next 6 to 12 months. With this as context, I will talk about our full potential strategy and some of the actions that we are taking to accelerate this strategy. I will then hand the call over to John to provide more financial details. After that, we will be happy to respond to any questions that you may have. Okay. Let's start with the first quarter. It was a very unusual quarter to say the least. Our business was strong through the first week of fiscal March, up to that point our comparable store sales growth for the quarter was running at about 3%. Of course, over the following couple of weeks the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic began to have a major impact on our business, especially in those parts of the country where the outbreak is the most severe. In order to minimize the health risks to our associates and our customers, we made the decision to shut down all of our stores by March 22nd. We also shut down our offices and distribution centers. As reported in today's press release, our sales declined 51% in the first quarter. We estimate that the Covid-19 pandemic drove a cumulative sales miss of approximately $1 billion to plan in the quarter. This led to an adjusted net loss of $312 million or $4.76 per share. This loss includes a $272 million charge that we took against our inventory at the end of the quarter. I would like to provide more detail on two aspects of how we ended the quarter. First of all, our inventory valuation and secondly our cash position. With a $1 billion miss to sales plan you would normally expect significant overhang of inventory. In fact, before the impact of the markdown reserve, our total inventory position as we ended the quarter was about in line with last year. This was driven by two factors. Firstly, we started the quarter with total inventory levels down 19% consistent with our strategy of running with leaner inventories. The second factor was that as the pandemic emerged in March, Jennifer Vecchio and the merchant team were able to move very swiftly to tighten liquidity and to work with vendors to collaboratively renegotiate, defer or cancel open orders. Although, our inventory level at the end of the quarter was in relatively good shape, we did take a $272 million charge against the value of this inventory. There were two reasons that we did this, firstly, the inventory in our stores is comprised of merchandise that was received in January, February and early March. It is aged merchandise and as our stores reopen, it is no longer seasonally appropriate. The second reason is that the next several months are likely to be very promotional as retailers try to clear the merchandise in their stores. As I will describe in more detail in a moment the priority for us is to turn our inventory so we can free up open to buy and take advantage of great opportunistic deals. We believe that the inventory charge that we have booked will pay for the markdowns that we expect to take in the second quarter to drive these inventory turns. As John will explain later in the call, we use the retail method of accounting, which means that this inventory reserve reflects our estimate on the full cost of these markdowns. Okay, let me move on to our cash position. When we shut down stores on March 22nd, we took a number of steps to reduce cash expenses. These steps included eliminating or reducing salaries, furloughing associates, reducing other operating expenses, lowering our capital expenditure plan and deferring accounts payables. As a result of these actions and our recent debt offerings and revolver draw, we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with approximately $1.5 billion in cash. We can use these resources to play defense or to play offense depending on the situation that we face. This significant cash positions also reflect actions that we took in April after our recent financing to begin to catch up on a portion of our accounts payable. We completed that process after quarter end in May. And at this point, we are completely current on our accounts payable. I would now like to provide an update on our store re-openings. We began reopening stores on May 11. And so far we have reopened 332 stores. As of tomorrow, that number will increase to approximately 400. As you would expect the situation is dynamic but we are anticipating that we will reopen most of the balance of the chain by the middle of June. For the stores we have reopened to date, we have been surprised and pleased with the traffic and sales that we have seen. These stores are experiencing sales levels that are ahead of the comparable period last year. There is clearly pent-up demand. And we do not know how long this sales trend will continue. Also, as we reopen, we are marking down the merchandise in the stores and offering very compelling values. We would expect the sales trends to moderate as we sell through this merchandise. With that said, let me make two points. First, as an off-price retailer, we are pleased with what we are seeing. We are excited by the chance to turn our inventory and to pursue great opportunistic buys in what we expect will be a very strong off-price of buying environment. Secondly, beyond this initial reopening period, we recognize that there is considerable uncertainty ahead. But we are current on payables, we have lean inventories and we have ample liquidity. So, we are well positioned to chase the sales trend or to pull back based on whatever situation we face. The most important priority as we have reopened stores has been to ensure very high standards for safety and social distancing. During the shutdown period, Fred Hand and his team did some terrific work to develop a detailed safety and social distancing program for our stores. This includes a combination of signage, personal protection equipment and new operating procedures for stores. When it comes to social distancing, we are somewhat helped by the fact that our stores are typically off more and in most cases are much larger than many of our peers. As we have reopened stores, we have continued to look for ways to make adjustments to improve this safety and social distancing program. The safety of our associates and customers will continue to be the overriding priority for us. In his remarks, later in this call John will provide more detail on the first quarter. But I would like to move on now to look a little further ahead to talk about what the retail world might look like in the next 6, 12 or 18 months. What this means for our full potential strategy. And what actions we are taking to position ourselves. As I have already mentioned, we expect the next few months to be extremely promotional as retailers attempt to rebuild traffic to their stores and to turn their inventory. This is likely to be exacerbated by some struggling retailers closing large numbers of stores and liquidating their merchandise. We believe that the inventory reserve that we set up at the end of the first quarter will enable us to aggressively compete in this environment. Beyond this initial period, it is very difficult to predict what will happen. But it is possible even likely that the aftermath of the pandemic will lead to conditions that are very favorable to off-price. A weak economy with the customer looking for great value. A weakened competitive set especially in the department and specialty store channels. And a very attractive opportunistic off-price buying environment. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us but we recognize that it is important to be patient and appropriately cautious. We know that our long-term success will not be defined by this quarter or even the rest of this year, rather it will depend on a steady march towards our full potential. This means getting prepared being patient. And taking advantage of the opportunities as they come. During our fourth quarter call in March, I described in some detail our off-price full potential strategy. The essence of this strategy is to offer our customers even stronger merchandise value by becoming more off-price. Meaning more flexible, leaner and more opportunistic. In the environment we are headed into, it is clear that this strategy will be more important than ever. In this call I am not going to revisit all of the details of our off-price full potential strategy. But you should expect that over the next 12 to 18 months, we will pursue the key elements of this strategy with even greater focus and bigger than we had previously planned. The key message is that in this situation where we are likely to be faced with significant opportunity but also considerable uncertainty. The action implication for us, is to be even more off-priced, more flexible, leaner and more opportunistic Let me give you a few specific examples. First example, as I described in March, we intend to build more chase into the business. This means planning our sales conservatively then being ready to chase sales if the trend is there or to pull back if the trend is weak. As we emerge from the pandemic, there should be plenty of availability. So, we will plan our sales even more conservatively knowing that we should be able to support any ahead of plan sales with great opportunistic buys. Second example, as I described earlier, we started the year with inventory levels down 19%. This is a key element of our full potential strategy to run with leaner inventories. Given the level of uncertainty in the months ahead, we now plan to operate with even leaner inventory levels. This will not only provide more flexibility to respond to the sales trend. But it should also drive faster turns and lower markdowns on any ahead of planned sales. Third example, in March, we talked about the need to increase operational flexibility including the need to get merchandise to the sales floor faster. Before the pandemic, we were thinking that this might take us a couple of years to accomplish. But now given the impact of the economic slowdown on the transportation industry, we think we may be able to get there much more rapidly. We will have more to say about these topics. And about our specific plans for the back half of the year when we report our second quarter results in August. But for now, let me reiterate the key message. In this environment, whether it\u2019s likely to be significant opportunity but also considerable uncertainty. The core principles of our off-price full potential strategy are going to be more important than ever. With that I would now like to turn the call over to john to provide more detail on our financials.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the review of the income statement. For the first quarter total sales decreased 51%, comparable store sales through the first week of fiscal March increased about 3%. As Michael mentioned earlier in the call, our decision to close all of our stores on March 22nd due to the COVID-19 pandemic drove the sales decrease. The gross margin rate was 2.0% versus last year's rate of 41.0%. The gross margin decrease was driven primarily by a $272 million inventory charge taken in the first quarter. This charge was taken to account for an increase in inventory aging which was caused by our extended store closures, and in anticipation of a very promotional environment in the coming weeks and months. Under the retail method of accounting, we have adjusted our inventory valuation to reflect our best estimate of the markdowns that we plan to take to liquidate aged inventory. We expect most of these markdowns will be taken in the second quarter. The inventory charge creates a reserve to provide for the anticipated markdowns. So, at this point we do not expect any additional markdown expense on this aged inventory in the second quarter. Product sourcing costs which included the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were $76 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $79 million last year. Adjusted SG&A, excluding management transition costs was $390 million versus $428 million last year. The dollar decrease was primarily due to a reduction in store payroll. Adjusted EBIT excluding management transition costs decreased by $617 million to a negative $499 million, driven primarily by the $272 million inventory charge and the decrease in sales. Depreciation and amortization excluding favorable lease costs increased $4 million to $54 million. Interest expense excluding the $1.1 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes remained flat versus last year's first quarter at $13 million. The adjusted effective tax rate was 39% for the first quarter versus last year's first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 18%. The increase in the tax rate was due primarily to the increased benefit from federal tax operating losses being carried back to offset income in previous years when the federal tax rate was 35% versus the current rate of 21%. The benefit from this carry backs increased the tax rate by about 12% in the quarter, which was offset slightly by a decline in hiring credits. Combined, this resulted in an adjusted net loss excluding management transition cost of $312 million versus last year's adjusted net income of $85 million. During the quarter in order to preserve our liquidity position during this period of store closures. We suspended our share repurchase program. Prior to this suspension, we repurchased approximately 244,000 shares of stock for $50 million. We have $348 million remaining on our share repurchase program which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share loss of $5.09 versus income of $1.15 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a loss of $4.76 versus a profit of a $1.26 per share last year excluding the $0.04 of management transition costs. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.5 billion in cash, $400 million in borrowings on our ABL. And had unused credit availability of approximately $150 million. During the quarter, we issued $805 million in five-year convertible unsecured notes with a 2.25% coupon and 32.5% conversion ratio. As well as $300 million in five-year senior secured notes with a 6.25% coupon. We ended the period with total debt of approximately $2.3 billion. Merchandise inventories were $626 million versus $896 million last year, a 30% decrease. The decrease was made possible by aggressive actions to reduce inventory receipts during this period of extended store closures. And was driven by the $272 million markdown reserve that we took at the end of the quarter to cover future markdowns. Pack and hold inventory was 22% of total inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 28% at the end of the first quarter last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores. Relocated 10 stores and closed three stores for a total of nine net new stores. We ended the quarter with 736 stores. In the second quarter, we expect to open three new stores with no expected closings or relocations. In fiscal 2020, we now expect to open 64 new stores and close or relocate 26 stores. This would translate to 38 net new stores planned to be open in fiscal 2020. This is a reduction from our original store opening plan of 54 net new stores for fiscal 2020. Eight stores shifted from spring 2020 to fall 2020. And 16 stores shifted from fall 2020 to the spring of 2021. We decided during the first quarter to delay these stores and the capital expenditures associated with them in order to preserve our liquidity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe in our long-term store potential of at least 1,000 stores. And this shift should not be viewed as a change and a long-term outlook for store growth. Cash flow provided by operations decreased by $326 million to a use of $272 million for the first quarter. Driven by lower net income due to our extended store closures, which more than offset the cash flow benefits of accounts payable and rent deferrals. Net capital expenditures were $57 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are now planned to be approximately $260 million for fiscal 2020 versus our original plan of $400 million. This decrease which was part of our strategy to preserve liquidity was primarily the result of deferrals of store openings, remodels, maintenance CapEx projects and corporate renovation projects. While we are not prepared to give sales and earnings guidance due to the uncertainty of the current environment, we can update you on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items. That may be useful for your modeling purposes. As I just mentioned, capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances are now expected to be approximately $260 million versus our previous outlook of $400 million. And we now expect to open 64 new stores while relocating or closing 26 stores for a total of 38 net new stores in fiscal 2020. This compares to our original plan of 80 new stores, with 54 net new stores and reflects the shift of 16 new stores from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2021. Also, depreciation and amortization expense exclusive of payable of these costs is now expected to be approximately $230 million versus our previous guidance of $235 million. And interest expense excluding $24 million in non-cash interest on the convertible notes is now planned to be approximately $80 million versus previous guidance of $45 million. This increase in interest expense is due to the recent $1.1 billion high-yield in convertible note offerings in addition to the $400 million in new borrowings on our ABL. With that I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you, John. As I wrap up these remarks. I would like to thank the entire organization at Burlington. Because of their hard work and commitment, we are emerging from this pandemic stronger than ever before. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead but we are very well positioned to absorb the risks and to take advantage of the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. With that I will turn it over to the operator for your questions, operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks. And congrats on a nice pace of initial reopening. Michael, could you share any color on sales levels that you're seeing with the initial stores that you've reopened? And any thoughts on the potential implications for the sales trend going forward?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Matt. Great to hear from you. Thank you for the question. Let me start by prefacing my answer by saying that the dataset that we have is very limited, and covers a short period of time. In fact, the way to think about this dataset is that there are about 250 stores that have been open for approximately two weeks. And there are about another 80 stores that have been open for just a week. So that's the dataset that we have. As I said in my remarks, the sales levels in these stores have been strong, running ahead of the comparable period last year. We've seen this strong sales performance in every market where we've reopened. And all our major businesses in these stores apparel, accessories, footwear and home have experienced sales trends that are above the comparable period last year. Moving on to the second part of your question, what are the potential implications for the trend going forward? I have to say that at this point, we just don't know. But there are a few reasons to be to be cautious. Firstly, there's clearly pent-up demand, the customer has been cooped up over the past eight weeks. Finally, if you have a chance to get out. It's difficult to know how long this pent-up demand will last. A second reason for caution is that as we reopen stores, we're marking down our aged inventory. So, we're offering very compelling values. And as we sell through this clearance, the trend should naturally moderate. The final point I would make is that the promotional environment is only just warming up. Even after we've sold through our clearance, other retailers will still be promoting I imagine for the next several months. Especially retailers that are closing stores and liquidating stock. This is likely to be a significant headwind for us for some time. Look, as I said in my remarks, we are surprised and pleased with the trend. We're very happy to returning our inventory and creating open to buy But we're being careful not to read too much into this early trend. It's great but we do not know how long it will last. And so the action implication for us is to remain nimble, flexible. Our merchants know that there is plenty of merchandise available. So, if it turns out that the sales trend in the coming months is very strong then we'll be ready to chase it. And if not, we will hold back.\nMatthew Boss: That's great color. John, as a follow-up, you ended the first quarter with roughly $1.5 billion in cash and over $1.6 billion in liquidity. What's the best way to think about your cash burn rate as well as your ability to generate positive cash flow as stores reopen? And hopefully begin to ramp up in incremental volume?\nJohn Crimmins: Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. Yes, cash burn is kind of a tricky question to answer just because our operating environment is so dynamic and under these conditions. As the environment changes, the way we think about preserving or using our cash continues to change. So back when our stores were closed and we were putting our new financing deal together we shared a few things that are probably worth revisiting now. At that time we said, with the $400 million ABL drawdown that we had done. Plus, our year-end cash balance about $400 million that gave us the ability to operate for several months without revenue given the steps that we take in to preserve liquidity. We also said that pro forma after the transaction that was going to give us enough cash to last us beyond the end of fiscal 2020 without revenues. Thankfully, the operating environment looks quite different now. Our stores are reopening, that's giving us some positive cash flow. And as that happens we're also stepping up our store payroll and our DC payroll, bringing furloughed associates back as we need them. In addition, if our stores continue to reopen and stay open generating enough positive cash flow we would plan on bringing back our furloughed corporate associates. And would also restore some of the temporary pay reductions we put in place. But over the last several weeks, we had been catching up on our temporarily deferred accounts payable and we're now fully current with our accounts payable. With the uncertainty around the future, we're going to continue to manage cash very prudently. You've heard Michael describe how we plan to manage our inventory in this environment. We're going to continue to carefully manage every element of our cash flow through the same filter. Looking to leverage our cash with great opportunities. But being careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. While we learn just what the new normal is going to look like.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning. Michael, John and David. Hope you all are doing well. I guess Michael, first one for you. I mean I think we talked a lot about \u201908, \u201809 and the off-price channel being able to take advantage of a really strong buying environment, gaining a lot of share. I guess, I'm curious your thoughts on the current situation. How does it compare to \u201908, \u201909 do you think things could play out the same way? Are there put and takes, I'm just kind of curious your high-level thoughts are.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure, good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. The underlying circumstances in 2008-2009 were quite different. But I do think it's a valid comparison. The aftermath of the pandemic may well create many of the same conditions that followed the financial crisis of 2008, specifically I think those likely could be huge availability of off-price merchandise great values compared with weakness in the department and specialty store channels and a strong consumer need for value over the next couple of years. Those conditions should be very good for off-price. But for the next several months, there's a lot of uncertainty and some major risks and challenges. The rest of the year is going to be very tricky to navigate and there's one other point to keep in mind when comparing our current situation with 2008-2009. I think that the pivotal moment in the financial crisis was really when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in 2008. After that the economy and retail sales had to fall apart; the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as I recall were very difficult for all retailers including off-price and the spring of 2009 that wasn't great either. It wasn't until the back half of 2009. So a whole year later that the off-price retailers really started to post very strong high single-digit even low double-digit comp store sales growth numbers. And from that point onwards really began to take market share. If you apply that same timing to the current situation, it takes us to late spring or even summer of 2021. So, yes, I actually agree. I think it's a valid a comparison. I think this could turn into a big opportunity for off-price, but one of the lessons from 2008 I think is important is it could take some time before the opportunity really materializes.\nIke Boruchow: Great, Michael. Super helpful and followed up on pack and hold and just curious you're thinking about your pack and hold business going forward in the off-price volume environment over the next several months is going to be strong. Is there any opportunity to buy up more merchandise now, defend the stores next year just overall your pack away strategy would be helpful?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Actually, it's a very timely question. At Burlington, pack and hold historically has been a relatively small, I would say been a relatively small part of our business. Certainly compared with some of our peers but even before the pandemic, we've been looking at strategically increasing how forward level of pack and hold go, making it a bigger part of our mix. We're actually planning to gradually do this, to gradually grow our pack and hold balanced over the next few years. But we're now thinking that we should accelerate this increase. If the off-price buying environment is as attractive as we expect it to be then the next several months could be the perfect time to strategically increase our technical levels. And to be clear, we would only pack away the very, very best deals. The very, very best values. So, yes, we do think there's a significant pack and hold opportunity. We're working on the details and the specifics on how to go after that. I would expect that we'll have more to say on this topic in the second quarter call in August.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJohn Kernan: Hey. Good morning, Michael, John and David. Good to see the excitement from your core customers of the stores reopen. Michael, in your remark you talked about the inventory reserve you took at the end of the quarter. I know you put quite a bit of emphasis since you joined on the full potential strategy plan. And then operating with leaner inventories per store was obviously a big part of that strategy. Just can you provide more details on the strategy behind the markdown reserve now? And then what that sets you up for the second half of the year strategically and financially?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Great. Yes, well, good morning, John. Thank you. I actually like how you bring the question because the reserve as I'll explain the reserve does tie directly to our strategy. But let me start by describing what the reserve is and then I'll talk about our clearance strategy and underlying rationale for that strategy and how it links to full potential. First of all, the reserves we've taken are intended to cover the cost of the markdowns that we expect to take on our existing inventory in the second quarter. As John mentioned in his remarks, we're on the retail method of accounting so this reserve is expected to cover the entire cost of those future markdowns. This is an important point when comparing with other retailers. Some retailers just reserve for a portion of the future markdown they expect. In contrast, our inventory reserve covers the full cost of the markdowns that we expect taking Q2. But let me take a step back and talk about our clearance strategy. And let me start with the obvious point that any inventory whether it's in a retail store, kept away at a warehouse or at a vendor warehouse is worth less now than it was in March. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, and the easiest to understand is that seasonal merchandise is now ended season and in the case of Eastern merchandise it's now out of season. And secondly and this is frankly the more important point of the two is that there is a glut of all merchandise types. There were goods that were made long before the pandemic that was scheduled to be delivered to retailers in March, April, May and even June. These orders were cancelled and now these goods have no home. Then in every category not just seasonal but basic merchandise as well. This glut of merchants buy will force down the value of all inventory over the next several months. Every retailer has to recognize that the inventory that they have is worth less now than it was in March. If they don't recognize that and if they mark it down then it's their sales. So department and specialty store retail it makes sense to try to minimize the impact of this by starting out with shallower markdowns and then eventually take them steeper discounts to clear the goods. But for us, there are two reasons I would say much more aggressive. Firstly, as an off-price retailer if you can turn your inventory you get the chance to go into the market and take advantage of great opportunistic buys. It is only really the off-price retailers who can do this. We can then slow these goods to stores to generate sales that are over and above for sales rate from our existing inventory. The full economics of picking this approach are much more attractive and holding on to aged merchandise watching it turn slowly and then reluctantly taking a steeper markdown later on. The second reason to be aggressive is that we recognize that the promotional environment just only going to get more intense as more and more retailers open back up and try to track traffic to their stores. And this promotional environment as I said in my remarks is going to be exacerbated in the coming months by store closures and bankruptcies. But I guess if I put all that together and sum it up, I would say our current strategy is to turn our existing inventory as rapidly as possible. And to use the liquidity that that will create to take advantage of opportunistic buys and thereby driving incremental sales and market share. As I said earlier, the inventory reserve we've taken is expected to pay for the full cost of the markdowns that we expect in the second quarter to support this current strategy.\nJohn Kernan: That's helpful, Michael. I think a logical part would be just how long do you think it'll be before you start buying fresh merchandise that you can flow to the stores and what should we expect for back-to-school and holiday?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Yes. It's a good follow-up. Of course, it depends on trends but for those stores that we, for those stores that we will reopen in May that would be about 400 stores. We anticipate that we will have sold through the majority of that clearance by the second half of June. So three to four weeks from now. For the remaining stores, in other words stores that will open in June, it's obviously a little harder to say before when they actually reopen but if these stores follow a similar pattern earlier openings then we sell through the majority of their clearance in the second half. So in terms of buying fresh merchandise. We are in the market. We have opened but I would say Jennifer and her team are being thoughtful, patient and surgical. We're only going to be buying the very best deals, but we know our vendors know and the off-price customers certainly know that all the previous reference points for value need to be thrown out. Whatever value the merchandise had at the beginning of March is not the value that it has now. And that principle is going to be top of mind for our merchants to go back into their -- into the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning. John, can you just spend a minute walking us through the first quarter P&L with the focus on what these results mean, if anything for your future performance?\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks Lorraine. That's a good question. It really was a crazy quarter and yes it is difficult to kind of get some context around our -- the results that we report today. I think it might be helpful just if I can walk through how they compare to, how we had planned the quarter. Yes, our guidance was based on how we had planned it and obviously things came up quite different from the way we expected. Lots of puts and takes but I think there's a high level way of kind of putting the appropriate context around it. So our EBITDA for the quarter were about $600 million below what we had originally planned. And there were some big pieces head in both directions. If we start with sales, our total sales were down about 51% from our plan which is about a $1 billion to take a kind of a normal gross margin flow through rate that hurt or EBIT by about $430 million. We also took $272 million hit for our markdown reserve, which restated the value of our inventory and as we've explained that charge is based on the estimated markdowns we expect to take over the next few months to liquidate our aged inventory. So the combination of the sales miss and the gross margin impact from our store closures is about $700 million negative of EBIT dollars. Offsetting this EBIT reduction we had about $110 million in expense savings, more than half of the expense savings were from the furloughs and the salary reductions that affected our store, DC and corporate associates. The remainder of the save came from managing the other components of SG&A expenses and from some Covid related tax credits. These savings were partially offset by about $10 million of incremental Covid related expenses costs of personal protective equipment, additional cleaning and some assistance we provided to furloughed associates. So to do a quick recap, we lost about $430 million from sales. $270 million from the inventory aging reserve. We had expense savings of $110 million; incremental expenses of $10 million reducing the net expense save to $100 million that gets you to the EBIT impact of $600 million that we saw in the quarter negative impact. As far as future performance, there's just so much uncertainty. There's not a lot I can say about that as our sales rebuild it's certainly our intent to get back to our previous performance levels as quickly as we can. And I really don't think the first quarter results would be much of an indicator of future performance. I certainly hope they won't be but I can say that by recording our aged inventory reserve in the first quarter, we don't expect to incur additional markdowns in the future to clear that inventory. I hope that's helpful.\nLorraine Hutchinson: It is. Thanks. And I just wanted to follow up on John's question. It sounds like you'll be buying fresh goods for the majority of the fleet -- in time for back-to-school. How would you expect the mix of your business to change to reflect this new post Covid environment?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. So the right way, as you'd expect we're looking very closely at these trends that we're seeing in the stores that we've reopened. I mentioned earlier, we're actually seeing trends for businesses but as you'd expect when you dig below the surface you see specific styles that it types specific category that are growing faster than others. And those are the things that our merchants are really focusing on as we get back into the market. For competitive reasons I won't get into a lot of detail but you can expect the pricing and dicing sales data that we're seeing to figure out which categories to go after.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you so much. And thank you for the very comprehensive comments and thoughts, Michael and John; I thought they were very helpful. I wanted to ask about your distribution centers and your second off- price full potential strategy. The increase in the operational flexibility at getting merchandise and sales force faster. First, are all the DC's open and operational at this point and are they able to replenish store inventory as its selling down? And then I have a follow-up to that.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure, Kimberly. Thank you for your question. Good morning. The short answer to your question is the DCs, our distribution centers are open and also all at this point and they are flow to merchandize to the stores that have reopened. Now there are a handful or actually a dozen stores that we've reopen that started so strongly out of the blocks, their sales trend was so strong as we reopen them that they're running very low on inventory and it's taking a little bit of time just for those couple of dozen stores to cash back up. So the answer to your question is yes. We are now back to our stores.\nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. That sounds like a high-class problem, Michael. And in terms of the follow-up, I'm wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the timing that you had initially planned with being able to pursue the end-to-end strategy of getting the merchandise to the sales floor faster. You obviously talked about the economic slowdown is impacting the freight industry and you might be able to get to this goal faster than you thought. So I'm just wondering if you can talk about the blocks, the building blocks of executing this strategy and if you have, if you think you might be able to see any sort of early results later on in 2020. Thanks so much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. So, yes, as you said we back in the call in March we have identified more flexible, more operational flexibility as a key component of our full potential strategy. Obviously, a key part of that is the supply in our distribution centers, the transit time scores et cetera being able to sort of reflect that actually move the goods fast that kind of thing. Now we were become-- we actually -- we were passing a couple of pilots that we were going to be doing in 2020 that we're going to be testing a number of different ways to speed up the supply chain makes it, make it more flexible. We were looking at a number of -- a number of things that we were going to test as part of those pilots. We're still planning to pursue pretty much everything that within those pilot programs. But we're now thinking in more ambitious tests this year. One of the things falling us back before was just the cost of retention specifically the cost of speeding up over the couple of years, we and other retailers have talked about capacity issues in transportation whether it's in rail or trucking or whatever. And how the cost of transportation has gone up. As a result of their current economics work, we're fortunate we were expecting that costs, everything we're seeing, health, the costs allows [Indiscernible] occupation, and we think that's going to provide us with the opportunity to make much more progress than we previously thought. So that's what we're looking at right now as the details of that. But the key point is that we're -- we've really been thinking about this there's something we're going to pilot and discover what different -- best to do for us --we're actually now being much more ambitious in terms of try and accomplish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Congrats on the reopen here and thanks for all the detail today. Very helpful, John, I guess just maybe a little help with from the near term first. You mentioned a couple times the inventory reserve you've taken should largely cover the cost of the inventory that you had on hand at the end of the quarter. We've heard from some of the other retailers you can't take reserves against inventory, it's inbound or anything that might have been coming in after the cutoff of the quarter. So I'm just -- I'm curious, you look, you seem to compartmentalize that pretty well for us, but what are the major puts and takes you see that influence the accounting on the gross margin in the second quarter now that you have that, I guess, I'd call it the bottom bucket of the inventory isolated and already accounted for. What do you anticipate will be the major puts and takes broad brush strokes?\nJohn Crimmins: Sure, Michael. Let me see what I can do is that, yes, so as you mentioned from a merch margin perspective, we believe we recognized age inventory markdown liability that was caused by the store closings that we've experienced. So go forward merch margins will largely be driven by our ability to properly balance our inventory levels with demand just like any other quarter really, but much more volatile. So a lot trickier to do it. So we're going to try and manage it the way we always do but you can expect the results to be more volatile just because we don't have a clear signal. Our bias of course is going to be to manage inventory conservatively and chase sales if demand exceeds our expectations. We expect as Michael described, there's going to be tremendous values out there to buy. So overall we would expect our merch margins to not be materially impacted if we buy the appropriate level of inventory. It's easier said than done, but we're going to manage it conservatively. EBIT margin is a little bit of a different story. It's a little harder question to answer because our margins going forward are going to be driven by our sales levels and it's really hard to forecast that right now as I'm sure you can imagine. So given the likely depressed sales levels we would expect deleverage on expenses to potentially more than offset the gross margin that we're going to generate. Yes, how much the expense deleverages will impact our profitability beyond the second quarter? That's dependent on our ability to get back closer to last year's sales levels. It's really difficult to put numbers or ranges around any of this just because of the uncertainty. Yes, I guess the only other thing that is, yes, we're -- we typically do a really good job of managing our kind of our store payroll to our sales levels that's going to be particularly challenging in the second quarter partly because of the volatility around demand and uncertainty around what this our sales forecast or what our actual sales are going to be. But also because there are going to be some incremental expenses at the stores. We've talked about safety and the comfort of our first store associates and also our customers being the most important thing and there are some costs, incremental costs related to doing that particularly during the store opening period that we're going to incur to ensure that customers as a coming to our store are comfortable shopping at our stores.\nMichael Binetti: Okay. Let me and thank you for that. Michael, let me ask you, usually the off-price industry is defined with very fast terms normally you wouldn't have much visibility very far out like I don't think at this point you'd really know what's available for holiday yet, but I'm sure you're thirsty for visibility as many. And based on the comments you've made on inventory availability being a step change higher than normal here, what we've heard from some of the major vendors that are public companies the levels of inventory cancellations they're planning to the back half can go from aggressive to staggering in some cases. So I'm just -- I'm curious what gives you some visibility a little further out than what would be the normal, they're fairly short term period for off-price. There's going to be a duration of good inventory availability and then as a follow-up giving your tenured space at one of your competitors and before that I think as a consultant to off-price in McKinsey, there's thousands and thousands more off-price stores in the world and there was and the obvious source of market share has been going backwards for 10 years here. So with more of you as a trough trying to speed on the inventory available in the space relative to the last recession, I think off-price merchandise margins went up 200 to 300 basis points in '07 to '0. Are the economics of the buys as good today given how competitive it is, what you would consider the best buys out there of distressed inventory that needs to come out during periods like this?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. Good question. Let me actually break the question in two pieces. First of all, in terms of visibility or merchandise availability. I guess I would go back to the point that I made a little bit earlier. This situation is actually completely open. I do think there's a worthwhile comparison relative 2000, but back then retail store is not closed at all for two three months and back then you did not have merchandise deliveries that would be delivered to retail over that two, three months period, what you really had was with some softening in the trend and cancellations and that's what drove merchandise availability. So now you have a situation this much more significant in terms available merchandize, as I said you basically have two to three months worth of merchandise that's available that surplus and that's unprecedented. Now how long will that last, I think it's likely to last for a while because it's such a huge amount of merchandize. So that I think the first part of your question. The second part of your question sort of competition within off-price. The reference point that I think is useful when you think about competition within off-price or not off- price is that if you look at, if you look at the sales of the pre-major off price retailers and you just pick public data. I think NPD published data. You get to a market share and this is all three of us combined. We have a market of less than 10% of the apparel, accessories and footwear in the United States. Now we sell other start apparel, accessories and foot wears but if you just stay with that market for a minute, we have a market share of 10% makes that easy that means that 90% of volume, sales volume goes through a non off-price channel. So I think off-price still has a huge amount of market share opportunity left and given weakness in a number of other retail format, I think that it's clear that there's an opportunity of market share.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. So now I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you. And have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the review of the income statement. For the first quarter total sales decreased 51%, comparable store sales through the first week of fiscal March increased about 3%. As Michael mentioned earlier in the call, our decision to close all of our stores on March 22nd due to the COVID-19 pandemic drove the sales decrease. The gross margin rate was 2.0% versus last year's rate of 41.0%. The gross margin decrease was driven primarily by a $272 million inventory charge taken in the first quarter. This charge was taken to account for an increase in inventory aging which was caused by our extended store closures, and in anticipation of a very promotional environment in the coming weeks and months. Under the retail method of accounting, we have adjusted our inventory valuation to reflect our best estimate of the markdowns that we plan to take to liquidate aged inventory. We expect most of these markdowns will be taken in the second quarter. The inventory charge creates a reserve to provide for the anticipated markdowns. So, at this point we do not expect any additional markdown expense on this aged inventory in the second quarter. Product sourcing costs which included the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were $76 million in the first quarter of 2020 versus $79 million last year. Adjusted SG&A, excluding management transition costs was $390 million versus $428 million last year. The dollar decrease was primarily due to a reduction in store payroll. Adjusted EBIT excluding management transition costs decreased by $617 million to a negative $499 million, driven primarily by the $272 million inventory charge and the decrease in sales. Depreciation and amortization excluding favorable lease costs increased $4 million to $54 million. Interest expense excluding the $1.1 million in non-cash interest on convertible notes remained flat versus last year's first quarter at $13 million. The adjusted effective tax rate was 39% for the first quarter versus last year's first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 18%. The increase in the tax rate was due primarily to the increased benefit from federal tax operating losses being carried back to offset income in previous years when the federal tax rate was 35% versus the current rate of 21%. The benefit from this carry backs increased the tax rate by about 12% in the quarter, which was offset slightly by a decline in hiring credits. Combined, this resulted in an adjusted net loss excluding management transition cost of $312 million versus last year's adjusted net income of $85 million. During the quarter in order to preserve our liquidity position during this period of store closures. We suspended our share repurchase program. Prior to this suspension, we repurchased approximately 244,000 shares of stock for $50 million. We have $348 million remaining on our share repurchase program which remains suspended. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share loss of $5.09 versus income of $1.15 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a loss of $4.76 versus a profit of a $1.26 per share last year excluding the $0.04 of management transition costs. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.5 billion in cash, $400 million in borrowings on our ABL. And had unused credit availability of approximately $150 million. During the quarter, we issued $805 million in five-year convertible unsecured notes with a 2.25% coupon and 32.5% conversion ratio. As well as $300 million in five-year senior secured notes with a 6.25% coupon. We ended the period with total debt of approximately $2.3 billion. Merchandise inventories were $626 million versus $896 million last year, a 30% decrease. The decrease was made possible by aggressive actions to reduce inventory receipts during this period of extended store closures. And was driven by the $272 million markdown reserve that we took at the end of the quarter to cover future markdowns. Pack and hold inventory was 22% of total inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 28% at the end of the first quarter last year. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores. Relocated 10 stores and closed three stores for a total of nine net new stores. We ended the quarter with 736 stores. In the second quarter, we expect to open three new stores with no expected closings or relocations. In fiscal 2020, we now expect to open 64 new stores and close or relocate 26 stores. This would translate to 38 net new stores planned to be open in fiscal 2020. This is a reduction from our original store opening plan of 54 net new stores for fiscal 2020. Eight stores shifted from spring 2020 to fall 2020. And 16 stores shifted from fall 2020 to the spring of 2021. We decided during the first quarter to delay these stores and the capital expenditures associated with them in order to preserve our liquidity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe in our long-term store potential of at least 1,000 stores. And this shift should not be viewed as a change and a long-term outlook for store growth. Cash flow provided by operations decreased by $326 million to a use of $272 million for the first quarter. Driven by lower net income due to our extended store closures, which more than offset the cash flow benefits of accounts payable and rent deferrals. Net capital expenditures were $57 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Net capital expenditures are now planned to be approximately $260 million for fiscal 2020 versus our original plan of $400 million. This decrease which was part of our strategy to preserve liquidity was primarily the result of deferrals of store openings, remodels, maintenance CapEx projects and corporate renovation projects. While we are not prepared to give sales and earnings guidance due to the uncertainty of the current environment, we can update you on certain fiscal 2020 cash flow and expense items. That may be useful for your modeling purposes. As I just mentioned, capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances are now expected to be approximately $260 million versus our previous outlook of $400 million. And we now expect to open 64 new stores while relocating or closing 26 stores for a total of 38 net new stores in fiscal 2020. This compares to our original plan of 80 new stores, with 54 net new stores and reflects the shift of 16 new stores from the fall of 2020 to the spring of 2021. Also, depreciation and amortization expense exclusive of payable of these costs is now expected to be approximately $230 million versus our previous guidance of $235 million. And interest expense excluding $24 million in non-cash interest on the convertible notes is now planned to be approximately $80 million versus previous guidance of $45 million. This increase in interest expense is due to the recent $1.1 billion high-yield in convertible note offerings in addition to the $400 million in new borrowings on our ABL. With that I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. Yes, cash burn is kind of a tricky question to answer just because our operating environment is so dynamic and under these conditions. As the environment changes, the way we think about preserving or using our cash continues to change. So back when our stores were closed and we were putting our new financing deal together we shared a few things that are probably worth revisiting now. At that time we said, with the $400 million ABL drawdown that we had done. Plus, our year-end cash balance about $400 million that gave us the ability to operate for several months without revenue given the steps that we take in to preserve liquidity. We also said that pro forma after the transaction that was going to give us enough cash to last us beyond the end of fiscal 2020 without revenues. Thankfully, the operating environment looks quite different now. Our stores are reopening, that's giving us some positive cash flow. And as that happens we're also stepping up our store payroll and our DC payroll, bringing furloughed associates back as we need them. In addition, if our stores continue to reopen and stay open generating enough positive cash flow we would plan on bringing back our furloughed corporate associates. And would also restore some of the temporary pay reductions we put in place. But over the last several weeks, we had been catching up on our temporarily deferred accounts payable and we're now fully current with our accounts payable. With the uncertainty around the future, we're going to continue to manage cash very prudently. You've heard Michael describe how we plan to manage our inventory in this environment. We're going to continue to carefully manage every element of our cash flow through the same filter. Looking to leverage our cash with great opportunities. But being careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. While we learn just what the new normal is going to look like. Thanks Lorraine. That's a good question. It really was a crazy quarter and yes it is difficult to kind of get some context around our -- the results that we report today. I think it might be helpful just if I can walk through how they compare to, how we had planned the quarter. Yes, our guidance was based on how we had planned it and obviously things came up quite different from the way we expected. Lots of puts and takes but I think there's a high level way of kind of putting the appropriate context around it. So our EBITDA for the quarter were about $600 million below what we had originally planned. And there were some big pieces head in both directions. If we start with sales, our total sales were down about 51% from our plan which is about a $1 billion to take a kind of a normal gross margin flow through rate that hurt or EBIT by about $430 million. We also took $272 million hit for our markdown reserve, which restated the value of our inventory and as we've explained that charge is based on the estimated markdowns we expect to take over the next few months to liquidate our aged inventory. So the combination of the sales miss and the gross margin impact from our store closures is about $700 million negative of EBIT dollars. Offsetting this EBIT reduction we had about $110 million in expense savings, more than half of the expense savings were from the furloughs and the salary reductions that affected our store, DC and corporate associates. The remainder of the save came from managing the other components of SG&A expenses and from some Covid related tax credits. These savings were partially offset by about $10 million of incremental Covid related expenses costs of personal protective equipment, additional cleaning and some assistance we provided to furloughed associates. So to do a quick recap, we lost about $430 million from sales. $270 million from the inventory aging reserve. We had expense savings of $110 million; incremental expenses of $10 million reducing the net expense save to $100 million that gets you to the EBIT impact of $600 million that we saw in the quarter negative impact. As far as future performance, there's just so much uncertainty. There's not a lot I can say about that as our sales rebuild it's certainly our intent to get back to our previous performance levels as quickly as we can. And I really don't think the first quarter results would be much of an indicator of future performance. I certainly hope they won't be but I can say that by recording our aged inventory reserve in the first quarter, we don't expect to incur additional markdowns in the future to clear that inventory. I hope that's helpful. Sure, Michael. Let me see what I can do is that, yes, so as you mentioned from a merch margin perspective, we believe we recognized age inventory markdown liability that was caused by the store closings that we've experienced. So go forward merch margins will largely be driven by our ability to properly balance our inventory levels with demand just like any other quarter really, but much more volatile. So a lot trickier to do it. So we're going to try and manage it the way we always do but you can expect the results to be more volatile just because we don't have a clear signal. Our bias of course is going to be to manage inventory conservatively and chase sales if demand exceeds our expectations. We expect as Michael described, there's going to be tremendous values out there to buy. So overall we would expect our merch margins to not be materially impacted if we buy the appropriate level of inventory. It's easier said than done, but we're going to manage it conservatively. EBIT margin is a little bit of a different story. It's a little harder question to answer because our margins going forward are going to be driven by our sales levels and it's really hard to forecast that right now as I'm sure you can imagine. So given the likely depressed sales levels we would expect deleverage on expenses to potentially more than offset the gross margin that we're going to generate. Yes, how much the expense deleverages will impact our profitability beyond the second quarter? That's dependent on our ability to get back closer to last year's sales levels. It's really difficult to put numbers or ranges around any of this just because of the uncertainty. Yes, I guess the only other thing that is, yes, we're -- we typically do a really good job of managing our kind of our store payroll to our sales levels that's going to be particularly challenging in the second quarter partly because of the volatility around demand and uncertainty around what this our sales forecast or what our actual sales are going to be. But also because there are going to be some incremental expenses at the stores. We've talked about safety and the comfort of our first store associates and also our customers being the most important thing and there are some costs, incremental costs related to doing that particularly during the store opening period that we're going to incur to ensure that customers as a coming to our store are comfortable shopping at our stores."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on this morning's first quarter earnings call. I hope that you are all safe and well in these challenging times. We are very glad that you could join us. On this morning's call, we would like to structure the discussion as follows. First, I will begin with a discussion of the first quarter. I will focus my remarks on where we ended the quarter with regard to our inventory levels and our cash position. Second, I will provide an update on the timing of our store re-openings and the initial traffic and sales levels that we are seeing. I will also describe the actions that we are taking in our stores to provide a safe environment for our associates and our customers. Third, I will describe the opportunities and the risks that we may face over the next 6 to 12 months. With this as context, I will talk about our full potential strategy and some of the actions that we are taking to accelerate this strategy. I will then hand the call over to John to provide more financial details. After that, we will be happy to respond to any questions that you may have. Okay. Let's start with the first quarter. It was a very unusual quarter to say the least. Our business was strong through the first week of fiscal March, up to that point our comparable store sales growth for the quarter was running at about 3%. Of course, over the following couple of weeks the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic began to have a major impact on our business, especially in those parts of the country where the outbreak is the most severe. In order to minimize the health risks to our associates and our customers, we made the decision to shut down all of our stores by March 22nd. We also shut down our offices and distribution centers. As reported in today's press release, our sales declined 51% in the first quarter. We estimate that the Covid-19 pandemic drove a cumulative sales miss of approximately $1 billion to plan in the quarter. This led to an adjusted net loss of $312 million or $4.76 per share. This loss includes a $272 million charge that we took against our inventory at the end of the quarter. I would like to provide more detail on two aspects of how we ended the quarter. First of all, our inventory valuation and secondly our cash position. With a $1 billion miss to sales plan you would normally expect significant overhang of inventory. In fact, before the impact of the markdown reserve, our total inventory position as we ended the quarter was about in line with last year. This was driven by two factors. Firstly, we started the quarter with total inventory levels down 19% consistent with our strategy of running with leaner inventories. The second factor was that as the pandemic emerged in March, Jennifer Vecchio and the merchant team were able to move very swiftly to tighten liquidity and to work with vendors to collaboratively renegotiate, defer or cancel open orders. Although, our inventory level at the end of the quarter was in relatively good shape, we did take a $272 million charge against the value of this inventory. There were two reasons that we did this, firstly, the inventory in our stores is comprised of merchandise that was received in January, February and early March. It is aged merchandise and as our stores reopen, it is no longer seasonally appropriate. The second reason is that the next several months are likely to be very promotional as retailers try to clear the merchandise in their stores. As I will describe in more detail in a moment the priority for us is to turn our inventory so we can free up open to buy and take advantage of great opportunistic deals. We believe that the inventory charge that we have booked will pay for the markdowns that we expect to take in the second quarter to drive these inventory turns. As John will explain later in the call, we use the retail method of accounting, which means that this inventory reserve reflects our estimate on the full cost of these markdowns. Okay, let me move on to our cash position. When we shut down stores on March 22nd, we took a number of steps to reduce cash expenses. These steps included eliminating or reducing salaries, furloughing associates, reducing other operating expenses, lowering our capital expenditure plan and deferring accounts payables. As a result of these actions and our recent debt offerings and revolver draw, we ended the quarter in a strong financial position with approximately $1.5 billion in cash. We can use these resources to play defense or to play offense depending on the situation that we face. This significant cash positions also reflect actions that we took in April after our recent financing to begin to catch up on a portion of our accounts payable. We completed that process after quarter end in May. And at this point, we are completely current on our accounts payable. I would now like to provide an update on our store re-openings. We began reopening stores on May 11. And so far we have reopened 332 stores. As of tomorrow, that number will increase to approximately 400. As you would expect the situation is dynamic but we are anticipating that we will reopen most of the balance of the chain by the middle of June. For the stores we have reopened to date, we have been surprised and pleased with the traffic and sales that we have seen. These stores are experiencing sales levels that are ahead of the comparable period last year. There is clearly pent-up demand. And we do not know how long this sales trend will continue. Also, as we reopen, we are marking down the merchandise in the stores and offering very compelling values. We would expect the sales trends to moderate as we sell through this merchandise. With that said, let me make two points. First, as an off-price retailer, we are pleased with what we are seeing. We are excited by the chance to turn our inventory and to pursue great opportunistic buys in what we expect will be a very strong off-price of buying environment. Secondly, beyond this initial reopening period, we recognize that there is considerable uncertainty ahead. But we are current on payables, we have lean inventories and we have ample liquidity. So, we are well positioned to chase the sales trend or to pull back based on whatever situation we face. The most important priority as we have reopened stores has been to ensure very high standards for safety and social distancing. During the shutdown period, Fred Hand and his team did some terrific work to develop a detailed safety and social distancing program for our stores. This includes a combination of signage, personal protection equipment and new operating procedures for stores. When it comes to social distancing, we are somewhat helped by the fact that our stores are typically off more and in most cases are much larger than many of our peers. As we have reopened stores, we have continued to look for ways to make adjustments to improve this safety and social distancing program. The safety of our associates and customers will continue to be the overriding priority for us. In his remarks, later in this call John will provide more detail on the first quarter. But I would like to move on now to look a little further ahead to talk about what the retail world might look like in the next 6, 12 or 18 months. What this means for our full potential strategy. And what actions we are taking to position ourselves. As I have already mentioned, we expect the next few months to be extremely promotional as retailers attempt to rebuild traffic to their stores and to turn their inventory. This is likely to be exacerbated by some struggling retailers closing large numbers of stores and liquidating their merchandise. We believe that the inventory reserve that we set up at the end of the first quarter will enable us to aggressively compete in this environment. Beyond this initial period, it is very difficult to predict what will happen. But it is possible even likely that the aftermath of the pandemic will lead to conditions that are very favorable to off-price. A weak economy with the customer looking for great value. A weakened competitive set especially in the department and specialty store channels. And a very attractive opportunistic off-price buying environment. We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us but we recognize that it is important to be patient and appropriately cautious. We know that our long-term success will not be defined by this quarter or even the rest of this year, rather it will depend on a steady march towards our full potential. This means getting prepared being patient. And taking advantage of the opportunities as they come. During our fourth quarter call in March, I described in some detail our off-price full potential strategy. The essence of this strategy is to offer our customers even stronger merchandise value by becoming more off-price. Meaning more flexible, leaner and more opportunistic. In the environment we are headed into, it is clear that this strategy will be more important than ever. In this call I am not going to revisit all of the details of our off-price full potential strategy. But you should expect that over the next 12 to 18 months, we will pursue the key elements of this strategy with even greater focus and bigger than we had previously planned. The key message is that in this situation where we are likely to be faced with significant opportunity but also considerable uncertainty. The action implication for us, is to be even more off-priced, more flexible, leaner and more opportunistic Let me give you a few specific examples. First example, as I described in March, we intend to build more chase into the business. This means planning our sales conservatively then being ready to chase sales if the trend is there or to pull back if the trend is weak. As we emerge from the pandemic, there should be plenty of availability. So, we will plan our sales even more conservatively knowing that we should be able to support any ahead of plan sales with great opportunistic buys. Second example, as I described earlier, we started the year with inventory levels down 19%. This is a key element of our full potential strategy to run with leaner inventories. Given the level of uncertainty in the months ahead, we now plan to operate with even leaner inventory levels. This will not only provide more flexibility to respond to the sales trend. But it should also drive faster turns and lower markdowns on any ahead of planned sales. Third example, in March, we talked about the need to increase operational flexibility including the need to get merchandise to the sales floor faster. Before the pandemic, we were thinking that this might take us a couple of years to accomplish. But now given the impact of the economic slowdown on the transportation industry, we think we may be able to get there much more rapidly. We will have more to say about these topics. And about our specific plans for the back half of the year when we report our second quarter results in August. But for now, let me reiterate the key message. In this environment, whether it's likely to be significant opportunity but also considerable uncertainty. The core principles of our off-price full potential strategy are going to be more important than ever. With that I would now like to turn the call over to john to provide more detail on our financials. Thank you, John. As I wrap up these remarks. I would like to thank the entire organization at Burlington. Because of their hard work and commitment, we are emerging from this pandemic stronger than ever before. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead but we are very well positioned to absorb the risks and to take advantage of the great opportunities that lie ahead of us. With that I will turn it over to the operator for your questions, operator? Good morning, Matt. Great to hear from you. Thank you for the question. Let me start by prefacing my answer by saying that the dataset that we have is very limited, and covers a short period of time. In fact, the way to think about this dataset is that there are about 250 stores that have been open for approximately two weeks. And there are about another 80 stores that have been open for just a week. So that's the dataset that we have. As I said in my remarks, the sales levels in these stores have been strong, running ahead of the comparable period last year. We've seen this strong sales performance in every market where we've reopened. And all our major businesses in these stores apparel, accessories, footwear and home have experienced sales trends that are above the comparable period last year. Moving on to the second part of your question, what are the potential implications for the trend going forward? I have to say that at this point, we just don't know. But there are a few reasons to be to be cautious. Firstly, there's clearly pent-up demand, the customer has been cooped up over the past eight weeks. Finally, if you have a chance to get out. It's difficult to know how long this pent-up demand will last. A second reason for caution is that as we reopen stores, we're marking down our aged inventory. So, we're offering very compelling values. And as we sell through this clearance, the trend should naturally moderate. The final point I would make is that the promotional environment is only just warming up. Even after we've sold through our clearance, other retailers will still be promoting I imagine for the next several months. Especially retailers that are closing stores and liquidating stock. This is likely to be a significant headwind for us for some time. Look, as I said in my remarks, we are surprised and pleased with the trend. We're very happy to returning our inventory and creating open to buy But we're being careful not to read too much into this early trend. It's great but we do not know how long it will last. And so the action implication for us is to remain nimble, flexible. Our merchants know that there is plenty of merchandise available. So, if it turns out that the sales trend in the coming months is very strong then we'll be ready to chase it. And if not, we will hold back. Sure, good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. The underlying circumstances in 2008-2009 were quite different. But I do think it's a valid comparison. The aftermath of the pandemic may well create many of the same conditions that followed the financial crisis of 2008, specifically I think those likely could be huge availability of off-price merchandise great values compared with weakness in the department and specialty store channels and a strong consumer need for value over the next couple of years. Those conditions should be very good for off-price. But for the next several months, there's a lot of uncertainty and some major risks and challenges. The rest of the year is going to be very tricky to navigate and there's one other point to keep in mind when comparing our current situation with 2008-2009. I think that the pivotal moment in the financial crisis was really when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in 2008. After that the economy and retail sales had to fall apart; the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as I recall were very difficult for all retailers including off-price and the spring of 2009 that wasn't great either. It wasn't until the back half of 2009. So a whole year later that the off-price retailers really started to post very strong high single-digit even low double-digit comp store sales growth numbers. And from that point onwards really began to take market share. If you apply that same timing to the current situation, it takes us to late spring or even summer of 2021. So, yes, I actually agree. I think it's a valid a comparison. I think this could turn into a big opportunity for off-price, but one of the lessons from 2008 I think is important is it could take some time before the opportunity really materializes. Sure. Actually, it's a very timely question. At Burlington, pack and hold historically has been a relatively small, I would say been a relatively small part of our business. Certainly compared with some of our peers but even before the pandemic, we've been looking at strategically increasing how forward level of pack and hold go, making it a bigger part of our mix. We're actually planning to gradually do this, to gradually grow our pack and hold balanced over the next few years. But we're now thinking that we should accelerate this increase. If the off-price buying environment is as attractive as we expect it to be then the next several months could be the perfect time to strategically increase our technical levels. And to be clear, we would only pack away the very, very best deals. The very, very best values. So, yes, we do think there's a significant pack and hold opportunity. We're working on the details and the specifics on how to go after that. I would expect that we'll have more to say on this topic in the second quarter call in August. Great. Yes, well, good morning, John. Thank you. I actually like how you bring the question because the reserve as I'll explain the reserve does tie directly to our strategy. But let me start by describing what the reserve is and then I'll talk about our clearance strategy and underlying rationale for that strategy and how it links to full potential. First of all, the reserves we've taken are intended to cover the cost of the markdowns that we expect to take on our existing inventory in the second quarter. As John mentioned in his remarks, we're on the retail method of accounting so this reserve is expected to cover the entire cost of those future markdowns. This is an important point when comparing with other retailers. Some retailers just reserve for a portion of the future markdown they expect. In contrast, our inventory reserve covers the full cost of the markdowns that we expect taking Q2. But let me take a step back and talk about our clearance strategy. And let me start with the obvious point that any inventory whether it's in a retail store, kept away at a warehouse or at a vendor warehouse is worth less now than it was in March. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, and the easiest to understand is that seasonal merchandise is now ended season and in the case of Eastern merchandise it's now out of season. And secondly and this is frankly the more important point of the two is that there is a glut of all merchandise types. There were goods that were made long before the pandemic that was scheduled to be delivered to retailers in March, April, May and even June. These orders were cancelled and now these goods have no home. Then in every category not just seasonal but basic merchandise as well. This glut of merchants buy will force down the value of all inventory over the next several months. Every retailer has to recognize that the inventory that they have is worth less now than it was in March. If they don't recognize that and if they mark it down then it's their sales. So department and specialty store retail it makes sense to try to minimize the impact of this by starting out with shallower markdowns and then eventually take them steeper discounts to clear the goods. But for us, there are two reasons I would say much more aggressive. Firstly, as an off-price retailer if you can turn your inventory you get the chance to go into the market and take advantage of great opportunistic buys. It is only really the off-price retailers who can do this. We can then slow these goods to stores to generate sales that are over and above for sales rate from our existing inventory. The full economics of picking this approach are much more attractive and holding on to aged merchandise watching it turn slowly and then reluctantly taking a steeper markdown later on. The second reason to be aggressive is that we recognize that the promotional environment just only going to get more intense as more and more retailers open back up and try to track traffic to their stores. And this promotional environment as I said in my remarks is going to be exacerbated in the coming months by store closures and bankruptcies. But I guess if I put all that together and sum it up, I would say our current strategy is to turn our existing inventory as rapidly as possible. And to use the liquidity that that will create to take advantage of opportunistic buys and thereby driving incremental sales and market share. As I said earlier, the inventory reserve we've taken is expected to pay for the full cost of the markdowns that we expect in the second quarter to support this current strategy. Sure. Yes. It's a good follow-up. Of course, it depends on trends but for those stores that we, for those stores that we will reopen in May that would be about 400 stores. We anticipate that we will have sold through the majority of that clearance by the second half of June. So three to four weeks from now. For the remaining stores, in other words stores that will open in June, it's obviously a little harder to say before when they actually reopen but if these stores follow a similar pattern earlier openings then we sell through the majority of their clearance in the second half. So in terms of buying fresh merchandise. We are in the market. We have opened but I would say Jennifer and her team are being thoughtful, patient and surgical. We're only going to be buying the very best deals, but we know our vendors know and the off-price customers certainly know that all the previous reference points for value need to be thrown out. Whatever value the merchandise had at the beginning of March is not the value that it has now. And that principle is going to be top of mind for our merchants to go back into their -- into the market. Sure. So the right way, as you'd expect we're looking very closely at these trends that we're seeing in the stores that we've reopened. I mentioned earlier, we're actually seeing trends for businesses but as you'd expect when you dig below the surface you see specific styles that it types specific category that are growing faster than others. And those are the things that our merchants are really focusing on as we get back into the market. For competitive reasons I won't get into a lot of detail but you can expect the pricing and dicing sales data that we're seeing to figure out which categories to go after. Sure, Kimberly. Thank you for your question. Good morning. The short answer to your question is the DCs, our distribution centers are open and also all at this point and they are flow to merchandize to the stores that have reopened. Now there are a handful or actually a dozen stores that we've reopen that started so strongly out of the blocks, their sales trend was so strong as we reopen them that they're running very low on inventory and it's taking a little bit of time just for those couple of dozen stores to cash back up. So the answer to your question is yes. We are now back to our stores. Sure. So, yes, as you said we back in the call in March we have identified more flexible, more operational flexibility as a key component of our full potential strategy. Obviously, a key part of that is the supply in our distribution centers, the transit time scores et cetera being able to sort of reflect that actually move the goods fast that kind of thing. Now we were become-- we actually -- we were passing a couple of pilots that we were going to be doing in 2020 that we're going to be testing a number of different ways to speed up the supply chain makes it, make it more flexible. We were looking at a number of -- a number of things that we were going to test as part of those pilots. We're still planning to pursue pretty much everything that within those pilot programs. But we're now thinking in more ambitious tests this year. One of the things falling us back before was just the cost of retention specifically the cost of speeding up over the couple of years, we and other retailers have talked about capacity issues in transportation whether it's in rail or trucking or whatever. And how the cost of transportation has gone up. As a result of their current economics work, we're fortunate we were expecting that costs, everything we're seeing, health, the costs allows [Indiscernible] occupation, and we think that's going to provide us with the opportunity to make much more progress than we previously thought. So that's what we're looking at right now as the details of that. But the key point is that we're -- we've really been thinking about this there's something we're going to pilot and discover what different -- best to do for us --we're actually now being much more ambitious in terms of try and accomplish. Yes. Good question. Let me actually break the question in two pieces. First of all, in terms of visibility or merchandise availability. I guess I would go back to the point that I made a little bit earlier. This situation is actually completely open. I do think there's a worthwhile comparison relative 2000, but back then retail store is not closed at all for two three months and back then you did not have merchandise deliveries that would be delivered to retail over that two, three months period, what you really had was with some softening in the trend and cancellations and that's what drove merchandise availability. So now you have a situation this much more significant in terms available merchandize, as I said you basically have two to three months worth of merchandise that's available that surplus and that's unprecedented. Now how long will that last, I think it's likely to last for a while because it's such a huge amount of merchandize. So that I think the first part of your question. The second part of your question sort of competition within off-price. The reference point that I think is useful when you think about competition within off-price or not off- price is that if you look at, if you look at the sales of the pre-major off price retailers and you just pick public data. I think NPD published data. You get to a market share and this is all three of us combined. We have a market of less than 10% of the apparel, accessories and footwear in the United States. Now we sell other start apparel, accessories and foot wears but if you just stay with that market for a minute, we have a market share of 10% makes that easy that means that 90% of volume, sales volume goes through a non off-price channel. So I think off-price still has a huge amount of market share opportunity left and given weakness in a number of other retail format, I think that it's clear that there's an opportunity of market share. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you. And have a good day."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On this morning\u2019s call, we are going to provide a lot of detail on our Q4 results and our 2022 outlook, but that is not where we would like to start. We realize that on these types of calls, it can be often be difficult to see the forest for the trees. They tend to be so much focused on short-term issues, but it can sometimes be very hard to see the bigger picture. So this morning, we would like to structure the discussion as follows: I will start by sharing and updating our perspective on the longer-term outlook and opportunity for off-price and for Burlington in particular. As part of this discussion, I will review our 2021 results, and I\u2019ll use these results to provide a progress report on our Burlington 2.0 strategy. Secondly, I will talk about the outlook for 2022, but again, I will try to place this outlook within a broader strategic context. We think that the next couple of years could create huge disruption across retail and that this may drive further restructuring of our industry. We strongly believe that Burlington has a value-focused, flexible off-price retailer will be a clear winner in this restructuring. Finally, I promise we will talk about Q4. We saw a major slowdown in our trend in the quarter, and as I will explain, we have a good handle on the drivers of this slowdown. Okay. So let\u2019s start with the longer-term. For many years, leading up to the pandemic, it was evident that our industry was undergoing a major restructuring. When you look at publicly available market share data, you can see that traditional department stores and other retailers, especially mall-based retailers, have been losing share over a long period. And from this same data, it is clear that for many years, the off-price retail channel has been gaining significant market share. We believe that the most important and powerful trend driving this restructuring is the consumer need for value. There is a growing segment of shoppers who care, above all else, about value. For many years now, this powerful trend has driven the growth of off-price retail at the expense of traditional retailers. Everything that I\u2019ve said so far was evident before the pandemic, but I would like to bring this narrative up to date based upon what happened in 2021. Last year, sales trends boomed across retail, driven by stimulus checks and pent-up savings. Meanwhile, supply constraints met inventory levels remained very tight. It is not surprising that this drove higher realized retail prices. But the key question coming out of this is, does anybody think that the customer no longer cares about value. Our strong view is that, of course, the customer still cares about value. In fact, given the rise in general price inflation, together with growing economic uncertainty, we suspect that over the next couple of years, the consumer need for value will be more important than ever. And the long-term trend of market share moving to the off-price channel will, if anything, accelerate. Two years ago, pre-pandemic, we launched our strategy to go after this market share opportunity, which we imaginatively called Burlington 2.0. This strategy is intended to make our company more off-price, flexible and nimble so we can better chase the sales trends and more effectively capture supply opportunities. Benchmark data shows that we are by far the smallest, least productive and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. We have a significant and unique opportunity to drive the growth of our top line sales and earnings over time. So now I would like to turn to our full year 2021 results, and I would like to use these results to assess the progress we have made with Burlington 2.0. Let\u2019s start with some huge positives. In 2021, we grew total sales by 28% versus 2019, and comp sales by 15%. This growth was well ahead of our peers. In achieving these results, we demonstrated our ability to chase. We had planned a flat comp for the year, but then chased 15 points above this. That\u2019s $1.2 billion of incremental sales. We did this with 20% less comp store inventory. This drove faster turns and over 150 basis points of higher merchant margin. There were also important milestones and investments that had no immediate effect on results, but are central to Burlington 2.0 and will have benefits in the years ahead. There are two, in particular. Firstly, we grew our buying and planning teams. At year-end, our merchandising head count was 36% higher than 2019. We hired and promoted some incredible off-price talent. Secondly, we began to roll out our smaller store prototype. As we discussed in our November call, we plan to increase our store count by approximately 60% to 70% over the next five years, and almost all of our new stores will be this new, smaller, more productive and more profitable prototype. This program will completely transform our company. Okay. How about the negatives? The most significant of these came in 2021 came in the form of freight and supply chain headwinds. Our operating margin in 2021 contracted by 60 basis points versus 2019. This was driven by 170 basis points of deleverage in freight expenses and 200 basis points of deleverage in product sourcing costs. Higher merchant margin and SG&A leverage, we\u2019re able to offset the lion\u2019s share of these higher expenses. We believe that some of these high upgrade and supply chain costs will go away over time, but some will remain. We know that we have other opportunities in our P&L, and as I will describe in a moment, we also believe that we have potential to take up prices. So we remain very confident in our five-year earnings algorithm that we discussed back in November. Let me sum up our progress. In 2021, as demonstrated by our results, we made huge progress on Burlington 2.0. We are much more flexible and nimble, and we are much more off-price than we were two years ago. We still have huge opportunity ahead of us, but the progress that we showed in 2021 exceeds any expectations that we had when we launched Burlington 2.0 just two years ago. Okay. Let\u2019s move on to 2022. As we described in November, 2022 is a very unpredictable year. All retailers will be up against comps that were inflated by non-recurring factors. Add to this, huge uncertainties around COVID, the economy, inflation, interest rates and freight and supply chain costs. In a moment, I will talk about how we are planning our business in the face of this uncertainty, but firstly, I would like to explain how this uncertainty fits within the broader strategic context that I described a moment ago. Those investors who have followed off-price for a long time know that a volatile and uncertain environment has in the past tended to favor off-price. Uncertainty can be difficult for any retailer, but it is especially difficult for traditional retailers. They can\u2019t chase the trend or pull back as effectively as we can. This makes it difficult for these retailers to manage inventories, and this often generates supply opportunities for off-price. 2022 turns out to be a volatile year, this could further strengthen our business. The biggest challenge for us in 2022 is that we are going to be up against industry-leading comp sales growth from last year. In the first three quarters of 2021, we ran 18% comp growth. This was 4 percentage points ahead of our off-price peers. In the first quarter of last year, we ran 20% comp growth. That was 7 to 8 percentage points ahead of our off-price peers. It makes sense to be cautious going up against these extraordinary comps. The other thing that is making us wary is that since early December, there has been a slowdown in traffic to our stores. There are analysts on this call who publish very helpful updates on traffic trends by retailer. This data suggests that there was a modest pickup in traffic in February versus January, but the two-year trend for most retailers is still well below December. There could be many reasons for this, Omicron, the timing of tax refunds, winter weather disruptions, the impact of inflation or just seasonal transition of spring assortments. It\u2019s difficult to calibrate each of these factors. Of course, traffic may pick up more significantly as some of these transitory issues recede. In a situation of uncertainty like this, our playbook is to plan conservatively and then be ready to chase and take advantage of opportunities. In November, we described that our initial buying and operating plans for 2022 are anchored on a mid-single-digit comp decline. Since then, the slowdown in traffic has made us more rather than less cautious, especially about the first half of the year. We have rebalanced our full year plan to recognize higher risk in the first half, offset by more upside in the back half. Overall, our full year baseline plan remains a mid-single-digit comp decline. As we said in November, you should not think of this as a prediction. We do not have enough visibility for a reliable prediction. Rather, please think of it as a baseline so we can react to whatever happens. As a reminder, our baseline at the start of 2021 was a flat comp. We then chased 15 percentage points above this plan. In a moment, John will share our margin estimates for this plan. These estimates assume freight and supply chain costs remain elevated through midyear and then begin to abate. You should note that these margin estimates do not yet factor in significant price increases, so let me talk for a moment about retail prices. As a value retailer, it makes sense for us to be cautious when it comes to raising prices. That said, there are several factors that give us confidence that we can raise retails. The most important of these is that over the past year, the value gap between us and other retailers has expanded. We have room to raise prices, but still offer great value to shoppers. We have already started to move up our prices, and we will get more aggressive in the coming quarters. As this happens, there could be upside to the margin estimates that John will provide. But given the uncertain outlook, we want to see how the trend develops before we build this margin upside into our forecast. I would like to move on now and talk about Q4. During the quarter, total sales grew 18% versus 2019 and comp store sales grew 6%. Compared to the rest of 2021, these numbers represent a major and a disappointing slowdown. We ran 16% comp through November, but then the trend dropped off. From the traffic monitors that we have in stores, we know that about half of this slowdown can be attributed to lower traffic and the other half to lower spending per shopper. We believe that the decline in traffic in December was driven by external factors, especially the surge in the Omicron variant and historically warm weather in December. But as discussed earlier, on a two-year basis, traffic levels have remained subdued over the past couple of months. There could be multiple reasons for this, many of which are transitory, but again, this is another reason we are being cautious in Q1. As I mentioned a moment ago, the slowdown in trend in Q4 was also driven by less spending per shopper. In other words, they came to the store, but they spent less. This was driven by our own execution. Let me explain. As you know, we had shipping issues and delays throughout 2021. We largely overcame these issues by placing orders earlier, thereby building attrition to absorb expected delays. This worked well all year. Even through November, we were in very good shape. But then in the critical weeks leading up to holiday, these delays got much worse. Holiday-sensitive businesses like holiday decor, guests, toys and food missed critical receipts. When we place the orders, we had built in more time to absorb delays, but in retrospect, this additional time was not enough. This is very disappointing. We are confident step up for these issues, we could have achieved a low double-digit comp. I know that and a token will get you on the subway, but there are important lessons for us here, and we\u2019re taking a number of actions to manage this process differently going forward. Based on their results, we believe that our peers built more cushion into their timelines. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on the Q4 and full year financials and our 2022 outlook.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with some additional financial details on Q4. Total sales in the quarter grew 18%, while comp sales increased 6%. As Michael said, our comp growth was up 16% in November, but then it started to drop off in December. The gross margin rate was 39.8%, a decrease of 230 basis points versus 2019\u2019s fourth quarter rate of 42.1%. This was driven by a 260 basis point increase in freight expense, which more than offset a 30 basis point increase in merchandise margin, driven by lower markdowns. Product sourcing costs were $159 million versus $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing 210 basis points as a percent of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented most of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were consistent with what we have discussed in prior quarters. Adjusted SG&A was $578 million versus $499 million in 2019, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. From an expense point of view, the timing of the slowdown in December could not have been worse. By then, we were staffed for holiday based on a low double-digit comp, we pulled back once we got through holiday, but by then, we had incurred significant expense. Adjusted EBIT margin was 9.2%, 410 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.80 versus $3.08 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.53 versus $3.21 in the fourth quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were down about 30% on a comp store basis. This was consistent with our strategy of finishing the year with much cleaner inventories. Separately, during the quarter, our buyers began to see a lot of great buying opportunities for reserve inventory. We thought that this might happen, and we were ready to take advantage of these great deals. Reserve inventory grew 62% versus 2019. We think that this will provide some great ammunition in 2022. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of 2021 to 840 stores. This included 8 new store openings and no relocations or closures. For the full year, we opened 101 new stores while relocating 17 and closing 5, adding 79 net new stores to our fleet. I\u2019d like to move on now and talk briefly about our full year 2021 results. Total sales increased 28% and comp store sales 15%. We chased $1.2 billion in sales above our original 2021 sales plan. Our operating margin for the full year contracted by 60 basis points, but it\u2019s very important to understand the major puts and takes. Merchant margin was over 150 basis points higher, and our SG&A leverage was worth 160 basis points. These items were more than offset by 170 basis points of deleverage on freight and 200 basis points of deleverage on product sourcing costs, mostly driven by supply chain costs. Let me move now to 2022. As discussed in November, our baseline plan assumes a mid-single-digit comp decline for the year. We have planned the first half more conservatively than the back half, with the first quarter planned most conservatively all at a mid-teens comp decline. On a stack comp basis, this Q1 plan is more conservative than the full year, but we think this is prudent given all of the reasons we described earlier. Until we begin to lap the stimulus payments, it makes sense to be cautious. Again, as we discussed in November, we would expect a mid-single-digit comp decline for the full year to drive operating margin deleverage of about 150 basis points. This estimate assumes that freight and supply chain expenses remain at elevated levels through the middle of the year and then begin to abate, and they assume no material increase in retail prices. For Q1, we would expect a mid-teens comp decline to drive operating margin deleverage of about 750 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. Given that we were up against 20% comp growth last year, it might be more helpful to use 2019 as the comparison year for Q1. On a stack basis, our Q1 plan implies comp growth of up 5% versus 2019, and operating margin deleverage of up to 400 basis points. This margin deleverage versus Q1 2019 is completely driven by higher freight and supply chain expenses. I would now like to turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Before we move to questions, let me summarize some of the key points that we\u2019ve covered this morning. We have a strong belief that our industry will continue to be reshaped by a powerful consumer need for value. This should drive further significant growth and market share gains for off-price retail. We are extremely bullish about our business. We see a lot of uncertainty in the near-term outlook, but the big advantage that we have over traditional retailers is that we can react to whatever happens, just as we did in 2021. We are planning our business conservatively, but flexibly for 2022. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So first, Michael, on your full year baseline comp plan, could you provide any color on how you arrived at this plan? How you\u2019re thinking about possible risks and also potential upside drivers to the comp plan for this year?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. I think what I\u2019ll do is, split my answer between the full year plan, and then separately, I\u2019ll comment on the first quarter plan. For the full year, our starting point was to look at the three-year stacked comp. I think most investors are familiar with this approach. Historically, we\u2019ve averaged about 3% comp growth per year. So over a three-year period, the stack comp would be 9%, 3 plus 3 plus 3. To hit a three-year stack comp of 9% this year means that our 2022 comp would need to be minus 6%, just mathematically. In other words, take the 15 comps we\u2019ve just reported, which is a two-year stat at minus 6, you get 9%. Now of course, we recognize that, that\u2019s just a starting point. Just because our three-year stack has been 9% historically, doesn\u2019t mean it will be 9% this year, but there are several things that could cause our comps to deviate from history. There are factors that could make it higher. There are certain factors that could drive some upside here, for example. If recovery in traffic accelerates as the pandemic recedes or it\u2019s possible that higher wage rates will mean that sales actually remain quite resilient even as we lap stimulus. And there\u2019s also the possibility that inflation may drive trade-down customers. So there are things that could drive our performance to be better. There are also factors that caused some risk. Again, the impact of inflation could go the other way. It could actually squeeze consumer spending. The higher interest rates could cause an economic slowdown. Global supply chain constraints could continue. It\u2019s difficult for us to weigh all of those factors. But based upon the data, we believe that a 6% comp decline is kind of gets you to that down mid-single digit. Yielding 9% three-year stack, it feels like a reasonable starting point. I want to underscore that it\u2019s a starting point, a baseline that we can \u2013 we intend to chase from. So that\u2019s the full year. Let me comment briefly on our Q1 plan of down mid-teens. Putting together our plan for Q1, it was actually much more difficult than planning the full year. The problem is that not only are we up against 20% comp from last year, but almost all of that growth came in the second part of the quarter. So for the first six weeks of Q1 last year, we ran 5% comp. Then the stimulus checks were mailed out, and for the remainder of the quarter, we ran 33% comp. Faced with those numbers, we\u2019ve planned our business conservatively because we want to see what happens to the sales trend once we anniversary the stimulus in mid-March. And look, I can see that it may turn out that we\u2019ve planned too conservatively, and if that\u2019s the case, of course, we\u2019ll make adjustments.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe to follow-up, Michael, larger picture \u2013 and you touched on it in your first remark there. The larger picture, as we think about the consumer impact of price inflation across the economic backdrop. What impact do you think this could have on your business in terms of traffic and spending levels? And in particular, how you think it may impact or have a potential negative impact on the low-income shopper?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve been thinking a lot about. We believe that the higher inflation that we\u2019re seeing right now could create a risk to our business, but also it could create a big opportunity. Let\u2019s start with the risk. It\u2019s not hard to articulate the risk. In the coming months, it\u2019s possible that consumers and especially, low-income consumers, as you referenced, will be squeezed as we lap stimulus payments. And at the same time, general price inflation begins to bite, especially on sort of the central items like food and gas. I should point out that a possible mitigant to that is, again, especially among low-income consumers, is that wage rates have also been going up. So we don\u2019t really know how all that will play out, but we recognize that there is a risk. Now as I mentioned a moment ago, there\u2019s also a potential opportunity for us. Usually in times of economic stress when consumers are under pressure, their natural and rational reaction is to focus even more heavily on finding great value. Higher inflation affects everybody. As a value leader at Burlington, we should be well positioned in that situation, and we think we might benefit from a trade-down customer. In my experience tells me that, that is actually what has happened historically. The record shows \u2013 I think the record shows that off-price retail has done very well in times of economic stress, but again, we don\u2019t know. Will there be a trade-down customer, when might this grade down happen. So we\u2019re being cautious, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\nMatthew Boss: It\u2019s great color. Thanks for all the detail. Best of luck.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning, Michael, John, David. I guess a question first for Michael and a follow-up for John. Michael, in the past, I think you\u2019ve been fairly cautious, even maybe skeptical about raising retail prices in the off-price space. I guess just bigger picture, what\u2019s changed? And what gives you the confidence that Burlington can start to potentially take some AURs up this year?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. Yes, you\u2019re right. In the past, I have been very skeptical about price increases. I recognize that in the past couple of quarters, the environment has really changed. If I go back to last summer, my view was that the main driver of higher prices at that point was the sudden growth in consumer demand during a period of constrained supply. So when demand exceeds supply, you get higher prices. But usually, demand and supply move back into equilibrium over time and prices fall back. But since then, I think what\u2019s happened is, we\u2019ve seen just a very rapid and I think somewhat unexpected increase in price inflation across the whole economy, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to end anytime soon. And I think that inflation is going to mean that some of the higher costs we\u2019ve seen, such as higher wage rates are here to stay. Now for retailers, that\u2019s going to mean not just a transitory increase in the cost base, but a permanent increase in their cost base. And the only way to absorb those costs is for retailers to keep prices elevated and also raise prices further. Given that all retailers face this issue, it\u2019s likely to mean that there will be higher retails across the whole industry. Now moving on to what does this mean for us? And actually, the second part of your question, what gives us confidence that we can actually raise prices. I think I would cite three main factors driving our confidence. Number one, over the last few months, we\u2019ve selectively tested higher retail prices. And so far, we have not seen any major issues. As described earlier that the slowdown in Q4 had multiple root causes, but higher retails were certainly not one of them. Second reason we\u2019re confident is that the value gap between us and most other retailers increased in 2021. Our strategy is all about offering great value to the customer, but the value is relative. As other retailers have raised prices, that\u2019s really created an umbrella for us to do the same, but still offer great and importantly, differentiated value to customers. And then the third \u2013 finishing up the third reason we\u2019re confident is, frankly, we listen to other retailers earnings calls as well. Higher retail prices seem to be working for them. We were never going to be a leader in raising prices, but we\u2019re certainly happy to follow when we see it working. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we need to be a little bit careful as we raise retail, especially in the first half of the year. But for the reasons I\u2019ve described, we think we have plenty of room to take prices up, but still offer great value to the customer.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks, Michael. And then, John, just real quick. I guess in November, you guys shared a multiyear earnings. Just kind of curious, how does higher pricing and then, of course, higher freight and supply chain expenses affect the model that maybe you described a couple of months ago?\nJohn Crimmins: Good morning, Ike. Thanks for your question. Good question. So let me just share how we\u2019re thinking about that. Compared to 2019, as you know, our freight expenses delevered by 170 basis points this year. We\u2019ve talked a lot previously about the global and industry-wide issues around freight. So I\u2019m not going to get into that again. But we do think that over time, these costs should improve. We don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to return all the way to \u2013 back to kind of pre-pandemic or historical rates. So it\u2019s still kind of difficult to estimate where that\u2019s going to end up, but we think that some of it may be 50 basis points of the deleverage could become a permanent part of our expense base. On the supply chain side, again, we\u2019ve been talking about that throughout the year. Compared to 2019, we had deleverage there of about 200 basis points. Some of this was higher wage rates, which we expect to be permanent, but some of that deleverage was driven by temporary incentives and inefficiencies that we don\u2019t expect to be permanent. Again, it\u2019s really difficult to kind of forecast or estimate, but we\u2019ll be disappointed if we don\u2019t recapture 50 to 100 basis points of the overall supply chain deleverage. We\u2019re going to have to see how things evolve before we have confidence in where these numbers are landing. But if our numbers are right, that would mean that these items would represent 150 to 200 basis points of deleverage or permanent expense structure. Now obviously, we\u2019re not going to accept that neither will any other retailer. We along with all the other major retailers are going to look for ways to recapture this margin. So one of the important levers in recapturing this margin is going to be our ability to take up retail prices. As Michael described a little earlier, over the past year, other retailers have raised the price umbrella, and we believe that\u2019s going to provide an opportunity for us to take up our retails over time and still be able to offer great relative value to our customers. So mixing this all together, I think there are some important puts and takes to our long-term earnings model. On the one hand, we expect some of the higher grade and supply chain expenses to become permanent, but on the other hand, we believe that we\u2019re going to be able to take up retails and capture incremental margin. So to wrap up, in terms of our five-year opportunity, we see it the same way we saw it at the end of Q3 when we talked about 200 to 300 basis points of EBIT margin expansion and mid-teens average annual earnings growth across the next five years. And as far as 2022, we continue to expect modest operating margin expansion, our expense algo, if you will, that modest expansion to begin around a 3% comp. So it\u2019s very similar to the way we spoke about it at the end of the third quarter.\nIke Boruchow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you, good morning. Michael, I have a question about supply. How is the buying environment right now? It looks like your reserve inventory grew really significantly in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about this?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Actually, I\u2019m glad you asked about this. I feel like I spent quite a bit of time on the call talking about how shipping delays hurt us in the fourth quarter. The flip side of that is that silver lining, if you like, is that the shipping issues happened across the retail industry, and they\u2019ve created a really strong buying environment for off-price. We had hoped, we have predicted that, that may happen. Over the past couple of months, our buyers have been able to take advantage of some really terrific buying opportunities, and those \u2013 these opportunities have covered four merchandise that we will pack away until later this year and even late arriving spring merchandise and actually, a good size of the increase that happened towards year-end was actually screen merchandise that we\u2019re going to flow to stores over the next few months. We feel very excited about the value and the content of our reserve inventory. Now we\u2019re always very careful about what we allow into our reserve inventory. There are strict controls and strict criteria on what we\u2019re prepared to store away in reserve inventory, but we feel really good about what we have in terms of value and content. Now I think it\u2019s pretty important to point out that, that inventory is going to be important, if, as we hope, we\u2019ll face a stronger trend in 2022. Leaving aside the reserve inventory, we\u2019ve also been seeing a lot of good deals for in-season merchandise that we can close stores right away. My assessment is that coming out of 2021, many retailers and vendors feel quite bullish about the outlook. They may turn out to be right, and I hope they are, but if they\u2019re not, if the trend is not as strong as they had planned, then this is likely to generate a lot of very strong off-price supply. And again, we can use that to fuel any ahead of planned sales.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. John, it\u2019s been a year since you\u2019ve increased your new store target, and we heard today that you\u2019re continuing to accelerate the store opening cadence. How is the program going? How are these new stores performing? And then how should we think about the impact of this performance on the future outlook?\nJohn Crimmins: Good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Really appreciate this one. So let me start just by reviewing kind of what\u2019s happened since we did announce our 2,000 store target on last year\u2019s fourth quarter call. As we walked through earlier, we finished 2021 with 840 stores after opening 101 new stores, relocating 17 and closing 5. So we added 79 net new stores to the fleet. Of those new stores, 48 of those were in the 30,000 square foot or smaller \u2013 new small store prototype. So it\u2019s still early, but overall, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance of these stores \u2013 of all of our new stores, but especially, the small format stores. Today, we announced that we plan to open 120 new stores, adding 90 net new stores to our fleet during 2022. We expect about 80 of those stores that we open will be in the 30,000 square foot or smaller format. So as we said previously, you should expect that longer term, over the next five years, 75% of the stores that we open will be in the small format. So as we continue to add more of the small store prototypes of the fleet, there are a few things that we\u2019re going to expect to see. We\u2019re going to see our sales funds, as we open these stores, start at about 70% to 80% of the chain average as they open, but we would expect comp store sales growth that\u2019s going to be faster than the rest of the chain for several years after opening. We would think better operating margins. We require operating margins for all of our new stores to be accretive to company\u2019s operating margin in year two, and then we\u2019d expect these stores to grow faster than the rest of the fleet over the next several years from an operating margin rate perspective. We expect much higher sales productivity than our larger boxes. These stores are the \u2013 in excess of $300 a foot on the growth side and $400 a foot selling square feet and are going to have lower occupancy and lower operating expenses. This more efficient operating model should translate to stronger full operating margins and access to better, more expensive retail locations that should also drive strong sales. So just another point to remember, we\u2019re different from a lot of other retailers in the productivity of our stores across our fleet varies tremendously. We have so many huge older boxes that have way more space than we need as we reduced inventory over the years. So for us, the big productivity gains that come with the smaller boxes and that\u2019s just going to help with adding stores to new markets, but there\u2019s also going to be a big relocation opportunity for us as we relocate existing stores to smaller boxes, in smaller boxes that are easier to operate, more efficient to operate and are in stronger retail nodes. So a lot of these boxes are older, oversized, in need of some refresh and so we\u2019ve actually seen, as we\u2019ve been doing reloads that we usually can see a pretty healthy sales lift along with improved four-wall profitability. Finally, over the next five years, we would expect to open well over 600 gross new stores, including about 150 relocations of older, less productive locations. So I think you could see that on a base of 840 stores over time, this is really going to be transformative to our chain.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions here. I have a couple of questions for John. First, how are you feeling about wage rates in stores given the levels of inflation we\u2019re seeing the competition for labor? And how should we think about the level of wage growth for stores and DCs you\u2019re baking into the 2022 outlook? And I\u2019ll just have a quick follow-up.\nJohn Crimmins: Okay. Thanks, John. So well, I guess, let me start, you probably heard us talk about this before. We manage our labor closely by monitoring the local markets where we operate stores, in the same thing of faster distribution centers. As each competitive market changes, we respond by making adjustments to be sure that we\u2019re competitive and we\u2019re able to properly staff our operations. Last year, as we discussed during the year, the DC labor market became ultra competitive in the second half of the year. And so we responded with a combination of permanent wage increases and temporary incentives that allowed us to maintain our desired staffing levels at our distribution centers. We also saw increased wage pressures in our stores, particularly during the fourth quarter. So we responded similarly with a combination of permanent increases and temporary incentives. So as of the end of the year, we think we\u2019ve kept up with the wage escalation that took place last year. And of course, we\u2019re going to incur the full year impact of those adjustments this year, but we\u2019ve included that in our plans for the year. We\u2019ve assumed that wage pressures are going to continue to accelerate in 2022 in our planning assumptions and in the outlook that we shared. So while we think we use reasonable assumptions, there\u2019s always some risk that wage escalation may happen faster than we\u2019ve anticipated, that it\u2019s certainly a volatile environment. And we\u2019ve got what we think are reasonable assumptions, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But it is more pressure than we planned for, a couple of things might be in our favor. We\u2019d likely see some sales benefit as many of our customers would have more income available if wages are going up higher than we expect. And it probably means that inflation is continuing, which could indicate a larger opportunity for us to raise retails to cover those additional costs.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. A lot of moving pieces there. Follow-up for John or David that the CapEx plan you shared for FY 2022, it\u2019s $725 million. It\u2019s roughly double FY2021. Can you walk us through the step up? Is this 7% or so level of sales, what we should model going forward? Thank you.\nDavid Glick: Thanks, John. I\u2019ll take that one. This is David. Yes, I understand how that can look like a big step up. So let me kind of walk you through what\u2019s happening. So we did spend about $318 million in 2021. Our plan \u2013 the original plan at the beginning of the year was $470 million. Obviously, it came in lower. Some of that spend that was originally planned for 2021 has moved into 2022. Why? It\u2019s caused by delays related to the disruption in the global supply chain. So it wasn\u2019t totally unexpected. In fact, some of the shift was for materials that we planned and order early, anticipating that there might be delayed, but it allowed us to be comfortable we could receive them well before they\u2019re needed. So if you look at 2022, without those timing shifts, we would have expected a CapEx spend of about $600 million, and that is a step up from our original plan in 2021. So what is that driven by? We\u2019re opening 120 stores versus 101, so increased investment in our new store development process. We\u2019re adding supply chain capacity and processing capability to support our accelerated growth. Remember, 28% sales increase versus 2019. So we need to keep pace with our supply chain. And there\u2019s several other initiatives that we believe will help drive productivity and efficiency across our business. So I think the way to think about it going forward, a rough $600 million is a good \u2013 to be using as a model going forward, but hopefully, that\u2026\nJohn Kernan: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Michael, I wanted to start with just circling back to some of the points you made when you were answering Lorraine\u2019s question. Can you just remind us of all of the levers that you\u2019ve got at your disposal to adjust to current sales trends in your stores, both as we work our way through the first quarter and the full year 2022? And just comment on the degree of usability of your reserve inventory to feed your spring business. Any other levers that you\u2019ve got at your disposal to chase upside in sales trends should the opportunity arise? And then the levers that you use as well to manage the risk on the downside, if trends prove more challenging. Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. Good morning, Kimberly. Thanks for the question. I think \u2013 actually, I think you know this, but I think that question kind of goes to the essence of Burlington 2.0. We\u2019re not the biggest retailer. We\u2019re not the most sophisticated retailer, but we have to be the most flexible retailer. That\u2019s kind of what Burlington 2.0 is all about. And the way we achieve that flexibility is to plan our business conservatively, but then be ready to chase and make sure that we have levers that are closer to chase. I feel like over the last two years, the whole company has been focused on that concept, Burlington 2.0, planning conservatively and chasing. And in the \u2013 if I think about merchandising in particular, our merchants start with a conservative buying plan, and then we chase based upon the strength of the trend. And in terms of individual levers, reserve inventory has certainly become important to us because you can see how that gives you ammunition to chase, but we also \u2013 we control our liquidity now a lot more, a lot more tightly than we used to. And that means that the buyers have an open to buy, they can go into the market, buy in-season merchandise can again chase. Now in terms of levers to pull back, the conservative plan itself is intended to accomplish that. So by planning conservatively, if the trend doesn\u2019t materialize, that\u2019s okay, we\u2019re planning conservatively. So that\u2019s the idea. Now I should say that last year, I feel very good about how we demonstrated our ability to chase. The thing that makes us a little cautious this year and the thing that makes us cautious about Q1 is that we recognize there are limits to this whole chase. Planning conservatively and then chasing work for us last year, and it works well when the trend is developing. And you can kind of add to the plan and chase it. In Q1, what we\u2019re up against is a single event that happened in the middle of the quarter last year, where comp went from plus 5% to 33%. And we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re planning as best we can against that event, but if our plan is wrong, if our plan is too conservative, it may be difficult to chase as fast as we need. It may take us a few weeks. So I want to recognize there are limits. Going back to the last part of your question about reserve, the usability of reserve, actually, the great thing about what we put away in reserve is that a lot of the growth that happened in our reserve inventory in Q4 was in spring merchandise. There was also some growth in four coated merchandise, which we\u2019ll bring out later this year, but there\u2019s a lot in there that we can use in the spring. So that does give us some ammunition and some additional flexibility.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Thank you so much. And John, I just wanted to circle back on your response on the store productivity. Those new smaller stores are hitting north of $300 in sales per square foot \u2013 sales per gross square foot, which is really impressive, particularly in light of the either the legacy fleet and where they are on productivity. I missed the way you characterized the sort of incremental margins or the new store margins on those locations as they\u2019re hitting that level. Are those accretive to overall company operating margins such that the growth of those smaller format stores has the effect of actually raising Burlington\u2019s operating margin over time? Thanks.\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Thanks. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a good question because there\u2019s actually two different benefits that we can get from the stores and the small format stores and the waiting can be a little bit different depending on the stores. So first of all, any of the stores that we open, smaller format or the other stores, one of our financial hurdles is for them to be accreted as company\u2019s EBIT in that year two, which is the base year of underwriting. And then for all of these stores, but particularly for the smaller stores, we expect kind of our sales maturation process and an operating margin optimization process that drives improvement greater than the rest of the fleet for the first few years, let\u2019s say, and so that we kind of get the combination of benefits. Either it\u2019s going to be a higher EBIT margin than we would have expected because of the operating efficiency of the smaller store or in some cases, the operating margin may be similar to some of our other stores as we open them, but we\u2019ll have had access to a stronger retail node and are going to be in a position that we\u2019re very excited about the sales opportunity in the store. So it\u2019s kind of a blend of those things both benefits from these smaller formats for us.\nKimberly Greenberger: Very clear. Thank you so much.\nJohn Crimmins: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Roxanne Meyer with MKM Partners.\nRoxanne Meyer: Great. Thank you. Good morning. My question is around home. Prior to the pandemic, you had ambitions to grow that home business. And clearly, the pandemic has hurt the potential for home, given the supply chain delays that disproportionately impacted. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how you\u2019ve been able to expand category breadth. How you think about growth this year, maybe particularly in the first half, given supply chain constraints? And just how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory of the home business longer-term?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Roxanne, I\u2019ll take that. Yes, home is a really important business for us and a huge strategic opportunity for us. It\u2019s interesting. If I look at Q4, by far, the bigger slowdown in Q4 in terms of business was home. It fell off significantly in Q4, and that is directly attributable to the shipping issues and delays that we discussed earlier. But if I step back from Q4 and talk about the full year, even with the slowdown in Q4, our comp across our home business was well over 30%. It compares with the chain at 15%. Our home merchants and planners did an outstanding job last year. And we had shipping issues all year, it\u2019s just we ended up with this crunch in Q4. To answer your question about how is the penetration of home grown since 2019. In 2019, our home businesses were about 17% of our total sales. In 2021, and again, this includes the slowdown in the fourth quarter, but in 2021, our home business was 20% of our overall sales, so a pretty decent increase in penetration in that period of time. And obviously, if we hadn\u2019t had the shipping issues in Q4, it would have been higher than that, so a lot of progress. And in terms of this year and the coming years, again, we still think we have a huge amount of opportunity. Now that opportunity, we\u2019re going after it. Yes, by expanding categories, by deepening vendor relationships, but more than anything else, we\u2019re going after it by strengthening the talent that we have, especially in our merchandising group. And when I look at the talent we were able to hire and promote last year, I think we\u2019ve made really, really great progress.\nRoxanne Meyer: Great. Thanks for all the color and best of luck this year.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Roxanne.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Michael O\u2019Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Before we hang up, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Burlington for their hard work throughout 2021. As a token of this appreciation and for the second year running, we\u2019ve awarded a special thank you bonus to the majority of our store, supply chain and corporate associates in recognition of their hard work and commitment in 2021. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late May to discuss our first quarter results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some additional financial details on Q4. Total sales in the quarter grew 18%, while comp sales increased 6%. As Michael said, our comp growth was up 16% in November, but then it started to drop off in December. The gross margin rate was 39.8%, a decrease of 230 basis points versus 2019's fourth quarter rate of 42.1%. This was driven by a 260 basis point increase in freight expense, which more than offset a 30 basis point increase in merchandise margin, driven by lower markdowns. Product sourcing costs were $159 million versus $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing 210 basis points as a percent of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented most of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were consistent with what we have discussed in prior quarters. Adjusted SG&A was $578 million versus $499 million in 2019, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. From an expense point of view, the timing of the slowdown in December could not have been worse. By then, we were staffed for holiday based on a low double-digit comp, we pulled back once we got through holiday, but by then, we had incurred significant expense. Adjusted EBIT margin was 9.2%, 410 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.80 versus $3.08 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.53 versus $3.21 in the fourth quarter of 2019. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were down about 30% on a comp store basis. This was consistent with our strategy of finishing the year with much cleaner inventories. Separately, during the quarter, our buyers began to see a lot of great buying opportunities for reserve inventory. We thought that this might happen, and we were ready to take advantage of these great deals. Reserve inventory grew 62% versus 2019. We think that this will provide some great ammunition in 2022. During the quarter, we opened 8 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of 2021 to 840 stores. This included 8 new store openings and no relocations or closures. For the full year, we opened 101 new stores while relocating 17 and closing 5, adding 79 net new stores to our fleet. I'd like to move on now and talk briefly about our full year 2021 results. Total sales increased 28% and comp store sales 15%. We chased $1.2 billion in sales above our original 2021 sales plan. Our operating margin for the full year contracted by 60 basis points, but it's very important to understand the major puts and takes. Merchant margin was over 150 basis points higher, and our SG&A leverage was worth 160 basis points. These items were more than offset by 170 basis points of deleverage on freight and 200 basis points of deleverage on product sourcing costs, mostly driven by supply chain costs. Let me move now to 2022. As discussed in November, our baseline plan assumes a mid-single-digit comp decline for the year. We have planned the first half more conservatively than the back half, with the first quarter planned most conservatively all at a mid-teens comp decline. On a stack comp basis, this Q1 plan is more conservative than the full year, but we think this is prudent given all of the reasons we described earlier. Until we begin to lap the stimulus payments, it makes sense to be cautious. Again, as we discussed in November, we would expect a mid-single-digit comp decline for the full year to drive operating margin deleverage of about 150 basis points. This estimate assumes that freight and supply chain expenses remain at elevated levels through the middle of the year and then begin to abate, and they assume no material increase in retail prices. For Q1, we would expect a mid-teens comp decline to drive operating margin deleverage of about 750 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. Given that we were up against 20% comp growth last year, it might be more helpful to use 2019 as the comparison year for Q1. On a stack basis, our Q1 plan implies comp growth of up 5% versus 2019, and operating margin deleverage of up to 400 basis points. This margin deleverage versus Q1 2019 is completely driven by higher freight and supply chain expenses. I would now like to turn the call back to Michael. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for your question. Good question. So let me just share how we're thinking about that. Compared to 2019, as you know, our freight expenses delevered by 170 basis points this year. We've talked a lot previously about the global and industry-wide issues around freight. So I'm not going to get into that again. But we do think that over time, these costs should improve. We don't think they're going to return all the way to \u2013 back to kind of pre-pandemic or historical rates. So it's still kind of difficult to estimate where that's going to end up, but we think that some of it may be 50 basis points of the deleverage could become a permanent part of our expense base. On the supply chain side, again, we've been talking about that throughout the year. Compared to 2019, we had deleverage there of about 200 basis points. Some of this was higher wage rates, which we expect to be permanent, but some of that deleverage was driven by temporary incentives and inefficiencies that we don't expect to be permanent. Again, it's really difficult to kind of forecast or estimate, but we'll be disappointed if we don't recapture 50 to 100 basis points of the overall supply chain deleverage. We're going to have to see how things evolve before we have confidence in where these numbers are landing. But if our numbers are right, that would mean that these items would represent 150 to 200 basis points of deleverage or permanent expense structure. Now obviously, we're not going to accept that neither will any other retailer. We along with all the other major retailers are going to look for ways to recapture this margin. So one of the important levers in recapturing this margin is going to be our ability to take up retail prices. As Michael described a little earlier, over the past year, other retailers have raised the price umbrella, and we believe that's going to provide an opportunity for us to take up our retails over time and still be able to offer great relative value to our customers. So mixing this all together, I think there are some important puts and takes to our long-term earnings model. On the one hand, we expect some of the higher grade and supply chain expenses to become permanent, but on the other hand, we believe that we're going to be able to take up retails and capture incremental margin. So to wrap up, in terms of our five-year opportunity, we see it the same way we saw it at the end of Q3 when we talked about 200 to 300 basis points of EBIT margin expansion and mid-teens average annual earnings growth across the next five years. And as far as 2022, we continue to expect modest operating margin expansion, our expense algo, if you will, that modest expansion to begin around a 3% comp. So it's very similar to the way we spoke about it at the end of the third quarter. Good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Really appreciate this one. So let me start just by reviewing kind of what's happened since we did announce our 2,000 store target on last year's fourth quarter call. As we walked through earlier, we finished 2021 with 840 stores after opening 101 new stores, relocating 17 and closing 5. So we added 79 net new stores to the fleet. Of those new stores, 48 of those were in the 30,000 square foot or smaller \u2013 new small store prototype. So it's still early, but overall, we've been very pleased with the performance of these stores \u2013 of all of our new stores, but especially, the small format stores. Today, we announced that we plan to open 120 new stores, adding 90 net new stores to our fleet during 2022. We expect about 80 of those stores that we open will be in the 30,000 square foot or smaller format. So as we said previously, you should expect that longer term, over the next five years, 75% of the stores that we open will be in the small format. So as we continue to add more of the small store prototypes of the fleet, there are a few things that we're going to expect to see. We're going to see our sales funds, as we open these stores, start at about 70% to 80% of the chain average as they open, but we would expect comp store sales growth that's going to be faster than the rest of the chain for several years after opening. We would think better operating margins. We require operating margins for all of our new stores to be accretive to company's operating margin in year two, and then we'd expect these stores to grow faster than the rest of the fleet over the next several years from an operating margin rate perspective. We expect much higher sales productivity than our larger boxes. These stores are the \u2013 in excess of $300 a foot on the growth side and $400 a foot selling square feet and are going to have lower occupancy and lower operating expenses. This more efficient operating model should translate to stronger full operating margins and access to better, more expensive retail locations that should also drive strong sales. So just another point to remember, we're different from a lot of other retailers in the productivity of our stores across our fleet varies tremendously. We have so many huge older boxes that have way more space than we need as we reduced inventory over the years. So for us, the big productivity gains that come with the smaller boxes and that's just going to help with adding stores to new markets, but there's also going to be a big relocation opportunity for us as we relocate existing stores to smaller boxes, in smaller boxes that are easier to operate, more efficient to operate and are in stronger retail nodes. So a lot of these boxes are older, oversized, in need of some refresh and so we've actually seen, as we've been doing reloads that we usually can see a pretty healthy sales lift along with improved four-wall profitability. Finally, over the next five years, we would expect to open well over 600 gross new stores, including about 150 relocations of older, less productive locations. So I think you could see that on a base of 840 stores over time, this is really going to be transformative to our chain. Okay. Thanks, John. So well, I guess, let me start, you probably heard us talk about this before. We manage our labor closely by monitoring the local markets where we operate stores, in the same thing of faster distribution centers. As each competitive market changes, we respond by making adjustments to be sure that we're competitive and we're able to properly staff our operations. Last year, as we discussed during the year, the DC labor market became ultra competitive in the second half of the year. And so we responded with a combination of permanent wage increases and temporary incentives that allowed us to maintain our desired staffing levels at our distribution centers. We also saw increased wage pressures in our stores, particularly during the fourth quarter. So we responded similarly with a combination of permanent increases and temporary incentives. So as of the end of the year, we think we've kept up with the wage escalation that took place last year. And of course, we're going to incur the full year impact of those adjustments this year, but we've included that in our plans for the year. We've assumed that wage pressures are going to continue to accelerate in 2022 in our planning assumptions and in the outlook that we shared. So while we think we use reasonable assumptions, there's always some risk that wage escalation may happen faster than we've anticipated, that it's certainly a volatile environment. And we've got what we think are reasonable assumptions, but we don't know what's going to happen. But it is more pressure than we planned for, a couple of things might be in our favor. We'd likely see some sales benefit as many of our customers would have more income available if wages are going up higher than we expect. And it probably means that inflation is continuing, which could indicate a larger opportunity for us to raise retails to cover those additional costs. Yes. Thanks. That's \u2013 it's a good question because there's actually two different benefits that we can get from the stores and the small format stores and the waiting can be a little bit different depending on the stores. So first of all, any of the stores that we open, smaller format or the other stores, one of our financial hurdles is for them to be accreted as company's EBIT in that year two, which is the base year of underwriting. And then for all of these stores, but particularly for the smaller stores, we expect kind of our sales maturation process and an operating margin optimization process that drives improvement greater than the rest of the fleet for the first few years, let's say, and so that we kind of get the combination of benefits. Either it's going to be a higher EBIT margin than we would have expected because of the operating efficiency of the smaller store or in some cases, the operating margin may be similar to some of our other stores as we open them, but we'll have had access to a stronger retail node and are going to be in a position that we're very excited about the sales opportunity in the store. So it's kind of a blend of those things both benefits from these smaller formats for us. You're welcome."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On this morning's call, we are going to provide a lot of detail on our Q4 results and our 2022 outlook, but that is not where we would like to start. We realize that on these types of calls, it can be often be difficult to see the forest for the trees. They tend to be so much focused on short-term issues, but it can sometimes be very hard to see the bigger picture. So this morning, we would like to structure the discussion as follows: I will start by sharing and updating our perspective on the longer-term outlook and opportunity for off-price and for Burlington in particular. As part of this discussion, I will review our 2021 results, and I'll use these results to provide a progress report on our Burlington 2.0 strategy. Secondly, I will talk about the outlook for 2022, but again, I will try to place this outlook within a broader strategic context. We think that the next couple of years could create huge disruption across retail and that this may drive further restructuring of our industry. We strongly believe that Burlington has a value-focused, flexible off-price retailer will be a clear winner in this restructuring. Finally, I promise we will talk about Q4. We saw a major slowdown in our trend in the quarter, and as I will explain, we have a good handle on the drivers of this slowdown. Okay. So let's start with the longer-term. For many years, leading up to the pandemic, it was evident that our industry was undergoing a major restructuring. When you look at publicly available market share data, you can see that traditional department stores and other retailers, especially mall-based retailers, have been losing share over a long period. And from this same data, it is clear that for many years, the off-price retail channel has been gaining significant market share. We believe that the most important and powerful trend driving this restructuring is the consumer need for value. There is a growing segment of shoppers who care, above all else, about value. For many years now, this powerful trend has driven the growth of off-price retail at the expense of traditional retailers. Everything that I've said so far was evident before the pandemic, but I would like to bring this narrative up to date based upon what happened in 2021. Last year, sales trends boomed across retail, driven by stimulus checks and pent-up savings. Meanwhile, supply constraints met inventory levels remained very tight. It is not surprising that this drove higher realized retail prices. But the key question coming out of this is, does anybody think that the customer no longer cares about value. Our strong view is that, of course, the customer still cares about value. In fact, given the rise in general price inflation, together with growing economic uncertainty, we suspect that over the next couple of years, the consumer need for value will be more important than ever. And the long-term trend of market share moving to the off-price channel will, if anything, accelerate. Two years ago, pre-pandemic, we launched our strategy to go after this market share opportunity, which we imaginatively called Burlington 2.0. This strategy is intended to make our company more off-price, flexible and nimble so we can better chase the sales trends and more effectively capture supply opportunities. Benchmark data shows that we are by far the smallest, least productive and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. We have a significant and unique opportunity to drive the growth of our top line sales and earnings over time. So now I would like to turn to our full year 2021 results, and I would like to use these results to assess the progress we have made with Burlington 2.0. Let's start with some huge positives. In 2021, we grew total sales by 28% versus 2019, and comp sales by 15%. This growth was well ahead of our peers. In achieving these results, we demonstrated our ability to chase. We had planned a flat comp for the year, but then chased 15 points above this. That's $1.2 billion of incremental sales. We did this with 20% less comp store inventory. This drove faster turns and over 150 basis points of higher merchant margin. There were also important milestones and investments that had no immediate effect on results, but are central to Burlington 2.0 and will have benefits in the years ahead. There are two, in particular. Firstly, we grew our buying and planning teams. At year-end, our merchandising head count was 36% higher than 2019. We hired and promoted some incredible off-price talent. Secondly, we began to roll out our smaller store prototype. As we discussed in our November call, we plan to increase our store count by approximately 60% to 70% over the next five years, and almost all of our new stores will be this new, smaller, more productive and more profitable prototype. This program will completely transform our company. Okay. How about the negatives? The most significant of these came in 2021 came in the form of freight and supply chain headwinds. Our operating margin in 2021 contracted by 60 basis points versus 2019. This was driven by 170 basis points of deleverage in freight expenses and 200 basis points of deleverage in product sourcing costs. Higher merchant margin and SG&A leverage, we're able to offset the lion's share of these higher expenses. We believe that some of these high upgrade and supply chain costs will go away over time, but some will remain. We know that we have other opportunities in our P&L, and as I will describe in a moment, we also believe that we have potential to take up prices. So we remain very confident in our five-year earnings algorithm that we discussed back in November. Let me sum up our progress. In 2021, as demonstrated by our results, we made huge progress on Burlington 2.0. We are much more flexible and nimble, and we are much more off-price than we were two years ago. We still have huge opportunity ahead of us, but the progress that we showed in 2021 exceeds any expectations that we had when we launched Burlington 2.0 just two years ago. Okay. Let's move on to 2022. As we described in November, 2022 is a very unpredictable year. All retailers will be up against comps that were inflated by non-recurring factors. Add to this, huge uncertainties around COVID, the economy, inflation, interest rates and freight and supply chain costs. In a moment, I will talk about how we are planning our business in the face of this uncertainty, but firstly, I would like to explain how this uncertainty fits within the broader strategic context that I described a moment ago. Those investors who have followed off-price for a long time know that a volatile and uncertain environment has in the past tended to favor off-price. Uncertainty can be difficult for any retailer, but it is especially difficult for traditional retailers. They can't chase the trend or pull back as effectively as we can. This makes it difficult for these retailers to manage inventories, and this often generates supply opportunities for off-price. 2022 turns out to be a volatile year, this could further strengthen our business. The biggest challenge for us in 2022 is that we are going to be up against industry-leading comp sales growth from last year. In the first three quarters of 2021, we ran 18% comp growth. This was 4 percentage points ahead of our off-price peers. In the first quarter of last year, we ran 20% comp growth. That was 7 to 8 percentage points ahead of our off-price peers. It makes sense to be cautious going up against these extraordinary comps. The other thing that is making us wary is that since early December, there has been a slowdown in traffic to our stores. There are analysts on this call who publish very helpful updates on traffic trends by retailer. This data suggests that there was a modest pickup in traffic in February versus January, but the two-year trend for most retailers is still well below December. There could be many reasons for this, Omicron, the timing of tax refunds, winter weather disruptions, the impact of inflation or just seasonal transition of spring assortments. It's difficult to calibrate each of these factors. Of course, traffic may pick up more significantly as some of these transitory issues recede. In a situation of uncertainty like this, our playbook is to plan conservatively and then be ready to chase and take advantage of opportunities. In November, we described that our initial buying and operating plans for 2022 are anchored on a mid-single-digit comp decline. Since then, the slowdown in traffic has made us more rather than less cautious, especially about the first half of the year. We have rebalanced our full year plan to recognize higher risk in the first half, offset by more upside in the back half. Overall, our full year baseline plan remains a mid-single-digit comp decline. As we said in November, you should not think of this as a prediction. We do not have enough visibility for a reliable prediction. Rather, please think of it as a baseline so we can react to whatever happens. As a reminder, our baseline at the start of 2021 was a flat comp. We then chased 15 percentage points above this plan. In a moment, John will share our margin estimates for this plan. These estimates assume freight and supply chain costs remain elevated through midyear and then begin to abate. You should note that these margin estimates do not yet factor in significant price increases, so let me talk for a moment about retail prices. As a value retailer, it makes sense for us to be cautious when it comes to raising prices. That said, there are several factors that give us confidence that we can raise retails. The most important of these is that over the past year, the value gap between us and other retailers has expanded. We have room to raise prices, but still offer great value to shoppers. We have already started to move up our prices, and we will get more aggressive in the coming quarters. As this happens, there could be upside to the margin estimates that John will provide. But given the uncertain outlook, we want to see how the trend develops before we build this margin upside into our forecast. I would like to move on now and talk about Q4. During the quarter, total sales grew 18% versus 2019 and comp store sales grew 6%. Compared to the rest of 2021, these numbers represent a major and a disappointing slowdown. We ran 16% comp through November, but then the trend dropped off. From the traffic monitors that we have in stores, we know that about half of this slowdown can be attributed to lower traffic and the other half to lower spending per shopper. We believe that the decline in traffic in December was driven by external factors, especially the surge in the Omicron variant and historically warm weather in December. But as discussed earlier, on a two-year basis, traffic levels have remained subdued over the past couple of months. There could be multiple reasons for this, many of which are transitory, but again, this is another reason we are being cautious in Q1. As I mentioned a moment ago, the slowdown in trend in Q4 was also driven by less spending per shopper. In other words, they came to the store, but they spent less. This was driven by our own execution. Let me explain. As you know, we had shipping issues and delays throughout 2021. We largely overcame these issues by placing orders earlier, thereby building attrition to absorb expected delays. This worked well all year. Even through November, we were in very good shape. But then in the critical weeks leading up to holiday, these delays got much worse. Holiday-sensitive businesses like holiday decor, guests, toys and food missed critical receipts. When we place the orders, we had built in more time to absorb delays, but in retrospect, this additional time was not enough. This is very disappointing. We are confident step up for these issues, we could have achieved a low double-digit comp. I know that and a token will get you on the subway, but there are important lessons for us here, and we're taking a number of actions to manage this process differently going forward. Based on their results, we believe that our peers built more cushion into their timelines. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on the Q4 and full year financials and our 2022 outlook. Before we move to questions, let me summarize some of the key points that we've covered this morning. We have a strong belief that our industry will continue to be reshaped by a powerful consumer need for value. This should drive further significant growth and market share gains for off-price retail. We are extremely bullish about our business. We see a lot of uncertainty in the near-term outlook, but the big advantage that we have over traditional retailers is that we can react to whatever happens, just as we did in 2021. We are planning our business conservatively, but flexibly for 2022. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. I think what I'll do is, split my answer between the full year plan, and then separately, I'll comment on the first quarter plan. For the full year, our starting point was to look at the three-year stacked comp. I think most investors are familiar with this approach. Historically, we've averaged about 3% comp growth per year. So over a three-year period, the stack comp would be 9%, 3 plus 3 plus 3. To hit a three-year stack comp of 9% this year means that our 2022 comp would need to be minus 6%, just mathematically. In other words, take the 15 comps we've just reported, which is a two-year stat at minus 6, you get 9%. Now of course, we recognize that, that's just a starting point. Just because our three-year stack has been 9% historically, doesn't mean it will be 9% this year, but there are several things that could cause our comps to deviate from history. There are factors that could make it higher. There are certain factors that could drive some upside here, for example. If recovery in traffic accelerates as the pandemic recedes or it's possible that higher wage rates will mean that sales actually remain quite resilient even as we lap stimulus. And there's also the possibility that inflation may drive trade-down customers. So there are things that could drive our performance to be better. There are also factors that caused some risk. Again, the impact of inflation could go the other way. It could actually squeeze consumer spending. The higher interest rates could cause an economic slowdown. Global supply chain constraints could continue. It's difficult for us to weigh all of those factors. But based upon the data, we believe that a 6% comp decline is kind of gets you to that down mid-single digit. Yielding 9% three-year stack, it feels like a reasonable starting point. I want to underscore that it's a starting point, a baseline that we can \u2013 we intend to chase from. So that's the full year. Let me comment briefly on our Q1 plan of down mid-teens. Putting together our plan for Q1, it was actually much more difficult than planning the full year. The problem is that not only are we up against 20% comp from last year, but almost all of that growth came in the second part of the quarter. So for the first six weeks of Q1 last year, we ran 5% comp. Then the stimulus checks were mailed out, and for the remainder of the quarter, we ran 33% comp. Faced with those numbers, we've planned our business conservatively because we want to see what happens to the sales trend once we anniversary the stimulus in mid-March. And look, I can see that it may turn out that we've planned too conservatively, and if that's the case, of course, we'll make adjustments. Yes. It's a question we've been thinking a lot about. We believe that the higher inflation that we're seeing right now could create a risk to our business, but also it could create a big opportunity. Let's start with the risk. It's not hard to articulate the risk. In the coming months, it's possible that consumers and especially, low-income consumers, as you referenced, will be squeezed as we lap stimulus payments. And at the same time, general price inflation begins to bite, especially on sort of the central items like food and gas. I should point out that a possible mitigant to that is, again, especially among low-income consumers, is that wage rates have also been going up. So we don't really know how all that will play out, but we recognize that there is a risk. Now as I mentioned a moment ago, there's also a potential opportunity for us. Usually in times of economic stress when consumers are under pressure, their natural and rational reaction is to focus even more heavily on finding great value. Higher inflation affects everybody. As a value leader at Burlington, we should be well positioned in that situation, and we think we might benefit from a trade-down customer. In my experience tells me that, that is actually what has happened historically. The record shows \u2013 I think the record shows that off-price retail has done very well in times of economic stress, but again, we don't know. Will there be a trade-down customer, when might this grade down happen. So we're being cautious, and we'll see what happens. Thanks, Matt. Well, good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. Yes, you're right. In the past, I have been very skeptical about price increases. I recognize that in the past couple of quarters, the environment has really changed. If I go back to last summer, my view was that the main driver of higher prices at that point was the sudden growth in consumer demand during a period of constrained supply. So when demand exceeds supply, you get higher prices. But usually, demand and supply move back into equilibrium over time and prices fall back. But since then, I think what's happened is, we've seen just a very rapid and I think somewhat unexpected increase in price inflation across the whole economy, and it doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon. And I think that inflation is going to mean that some of the higher costs we've seen, such as higher wage rates are here to stay. Now for retailers, that's going to mean not just a transitory increase in the cost base, but a permanent increase in their cost base. And the only way to absorb those costs is for retailers to keep prices elevated and also raise prices further. Given that all retailers face this issue, it's likely to mean that there will be higher retails across the whole industry. Now moving on to what does this mean for us? And actually, the second part of your question, what gives us confidence that we can actually raise prices. I think I would cite three main factors driving our confidence. Number one, over the last few months, we've selectively tested higher retail prices. And so far, we have not seen any major issues. As described earlier that the slowdown in Q4 had multiple root causes, but higher retails were certainly not one of them. Second reason we're confident is that the value gap between us and most other retailers increased in 2021. Our strategy is all about offering great value to the customer, but the value is relative. As other retailers have raised prices, that's really created an umbrella for us to do the same, but still offer great and importantly, differentiated value to customers. And then the third \u2013 finishing up the third reason we're confident is, frankly, we listen to other retailers earnings calls as well. Higher retail prices seem to be working for them. We were never going to be a leader in raising prices, but we're certainly happy to follow when we see it working. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we need to be a little bit careful as we raise retail, especially in the first half of the year. But for the reasons I've described, we think we have plenty of room to take prices up, but still offer great value to the customer. Sure. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Actually, I'm glad you asked about this. I feel like I spent quite a bit of time on the call talking about how shipping delays hurt us in the fourth quarter. The flip side of that is that silver lining, if you like, is that the shipping issues happened across the retail industry, and they've created a really strong buying environment for off-price. We had hoped, we have predicted that, that may happen. Over the past couple of months, our buyers have been able to take advantage of some really terrific buying opportunities, and those \u2013 these opportunities have covered four merchandise that we will pack away until later this year and even late arriving spring merchandise and actually, a good size of the increase that happened towards year-end was actually screen merchandise that we're going to flow to stores over the next few months. We feel very excited about the value and the content of our reserve inventory. Now we're always very careful about what we allow into our reserve inventory. There are strict controls and strict criteria on what we're prepared to store away in reserve inventory, but we feel really good about what we have in terms of value and content. Now I think it's pretty important to point out that, that inventory is going to be important, if, as we hope, we'll face a stronger trend in 2022. Leaving aside the reserve inventory, we've also been seeing a lot of good deals for in-season merchandise that we can close stores right away. My assessment is that coming out of 2021, many retailers and vendors feel quite bullish about the outlook. They may turn out to be right, and I hope they are, but if they're not, if the trend is not as strong as they had planned, then this is likely to generate a lot of very strong off-price supply. And again, we can use that to fuel any ahead of planned sales. Yes. Good morning, Kimberly. Thanks for the question. I think \u2013 actually, I think you know this, but I think that question kind of goes to the essence of Burlington 2.0. We're not the biggest retailer. We're not the most sophisticated retailer, but we have to be the most flexible retailer. That's kind of what Burlington 2.0 is all about. And the way we achieve that flexibility is to plan our business conservatively, but then be ready to chase and make sure that we have levers that are closer to chase. I feel like over the last two years, the whole company has been focused on that concept, Burlington 2.0, planning conservatively and chasing. And in the \u2013 if I think about merchandising in particular, our merchants start with a conservative buying plan, and then we chase based upon the strength of the trend. And in terms of individual levers, reserve inventory has certainly become important to us because you can see how that gives you ammunition to chase, but we also \u2013 we control our liquidity now a lot more, a lot more tightly than we used to. And that means that the buyers have an open to buy, they can go into the market, buy in-season merchandise can again chase. Now in terms of levers to pull back, the conservative plan itself is intended to accomplish that. So by planning conservatively, if the trend doesn't materialize, that's okay, we're planning conservatively. So that's the idea. Now I should say that last year, I feel very good about how we demonstrated our ability to chase. The thing that makes us a little cautious this year and the thing that makes us cautious about Q1 is that we recognize there are limits to this whole chase. Planning conservatively and then chasing work for us last year, and it works well when the trend is developing. And you can kind of add to the plan and chase it. In Q1, what we're up against is a single event that happened in the middle of the quarter last year, where comp went from plus 5% to 33%. And we don't \u2013 we're planning as best we can against that event, but if our plan is wrong, if our plan is too conservative, it may be difficult to chase as fast as we need. It may take us a few weeks. So I want to recognize there are limits. Going back to the last part of your question about reserve, the usability of reserve, actually, the great thing about what we put away in reserve is that a lot of the growth that happened in our reserve inventory in Q4 was in spring merchandise. There was also some growth in four coated merchandise, which we'll bring out later this year, but there's a lot in there that we can use in the spring. So that does give us some ammunition and some additional flexibility. Sure. Roxanne, I'll take that. Yes, home is a really important business for us and a huge strategic opportunity for us. It's interesting. If I look at Q4, by far, the bigger slowdown in Q4 in terms of business was home. It fell off significantly in Q4, and that is directly attributable to the shipping issues and delays that we discussed earlier. But if I step back from Q4 and talk about the full year, even with the slowdown in Q4, our comp across our home business was well over 30%. It compares with the chain at 15%. Our home merchants and planners did an outstanding job last year. And we had shipping issues all year, it's just we ended up with this crunch in Q4. To answer your question about how is the penetration of home grown since 2019. In 2019, our home businesses were about 17% of our total sales. In 2021, and again, this includes the slowdown in the fourth quarter, but in 2021, our home business was 20% of our overall sales, so a pretty decent increase in penetration in that period of time. And obviously, if we hadn't had the shipping issues in Q4, it would have been higher than that, so a lot of progress. And in terms of this year and the coming years, again, we still think we have a huge amount of opportunity. Now that opportunity, we're going after it. Yes, by expanding categories, by deepening vendor relationships, but more than anything else, we're going after it by strengthening the talent that we have, especially in our merchandising group. And when I look at the talent we were able to hire and promote last year, I think we've made really, really great progress. Thanks, Roxanne. Before we hang up, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Burlington for their hard work throughout 2021. As a token of this appreciation and for the second year running, we've awarded a special thank you bonus to the majority of our store, supply chain and corporate associates in recognition of their hard work and commitment in 2021. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late May to discuss our first quarter results. Thank you for your time today."

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our usual approach on these calls is to structure our remarks in a chronological order, starting with a review of the most recent quarter, then moving on to the next quarter and the year ahead, and finally commenting on the longer term outlook. Today, we're going to take a slightly different approach, rather than chronologically, we will cover these topics in order of their importance to our long-term shareholder value. I will begin with our longer term expectations. The timeframe for these remarks will be the next five years. Then, I will move nearer in and talk about 2022. We think that 2022 is going to be very unpredictable. That said, we believe it could provide the ideal setup for our business. Finally, I will comment on our Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Okay, the longer term. There are two aspects of the longer term that I would like to talk about. Number one, the macro economic and competitive environment. And number two, progress we are making on our Burlington 2.0 strategy. On the macroeconomic and competitive environment, let's start with the customer. For many years, there has been a growing consumer focus on value. It is possible that we are entering a period, a prolonged period of consumer price inflation across the whole economy. We believe that in inflationary periods, consumers trade down not up. In an environment of rising prices, we think shoppers will be even more attracted to the great value that we offer. Our business is a third bigger now than it was in 2019. One reason for this is that our value differentiation versus other retailers has grown. The delta between the price of an item at Burlington and the price of a line item at a full price store has never been greater. Leaner inventories in the full price channel have driven higher realized prices. It is not clear if these higher prices will be sustained. If they are sustained, then in the coming quarters, we think that we may have the opportunity to capture additional market share, to take up our retail prices or to do both. If on the other hand, retailers returned to more promotional habits, then these higher realized prices in the full price channel will come down. If that were to happen, then we think it would trigger yet another wave of consolidation of marginally profitable for price, bricks and mortar stores. We anticipate that the second scenario, a return to a promotional environment and a decline in realized prices is the more likely, but it's going to take some time to see how this plays out. But in either scenario, we think that the long term implications for Burlington are very favorable. I would like to talk now about the progress that we are making on Burlington 2.0. The core of this strategy is to make our business as flexible as possible, so we can chase the sales trends, take advantage of supply opportunities, and deliver great value to our customers. So far this year, we have changed from a comp plan of flat to an actual year-to-date comp of 18% versus 2019. In addition to comp growth, we are very excited about our new store performance, especially our smaller store prototype. In 2021, we have opened 101 new stores. This translates to 77 net new stores after closures and relocations. Our new stores are performing extremely well. And I am excited to announce that we have decided to accelerate our new store opening program. In 2022, we expect to open about 120 new stores, which after closures and relocations should yield about 90 net new stores. Beyond 2022, we now expect to open 130 to 150. new stores each year. About 30 of these will be relocations of older stores to newer, smaller price prototype locations. So overall, from 2023 onwards, we expect to open 100 to 120 net new stores each year. Today, we have just over 800 stores. So in the next five years, this program will drive a very exciting transformation of our chain. Moving closer in, I would like to talk now about 2022. We think that there are three factors that could make 2022 a very good year for Burlington. But all three factors are difficult to predict. Firstly, sales. This year, all retailers have benefited from onetime items like stimulus checks and pent up demand. As we get into 2022 and lack these items, it seems likely that conference across retail will fall off sharply. On the other hand, it is possible that rising wage rates or further government spending will offset this decline. We have to be ready for either scenario. Secondly, pricing. As I said a moment ago, we don't yet know if higher realized prices at full price retailers will be sustained. This will play out in 2022. If these higher prices are sustained even a supply loosens up, then we think we will have a tremendous opportunity to drive sales or to take up retails or to do both. And if there is a general rise in inflation across the whole economy, then this opportunity could be even greater. Thirdly, we do not know if the issues with global supply chains will ease in 2022. If they do, then this could have a huge beneficial impact on off-price supply. And it could also drive significantly lower freight and supply chain expenses. We don't have great visibility on any of these three items. No one does. But in this situation, our playbook is always to plan our business conservatively and be ready to chase. So our initial buying and operating plans for 2022 are anchored on a mid-single digit comp decline. This is not a prediction of what we think will happen. We do not have enough visibility for reliable prediction. You should think of the minus 5% comp as a baseline a starting point for the chase. In 2021 our baseline was a flat comp. Year-to-date we have chased sales 18 points above this baseline. As for our margins, so much depends on freight and supply chain expenses. Again, we can see that we do not know how these will play out. We think that these expenses should start to come down in 2022. But we don't know if, when, and how much this will happen. In a moment, John will share our margin estimates, assuming that these costs remain at their current levels through mid-2022 and then begin to moderate. I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few comments on our Q3 performance and our Q4 outlook. As described in today's press release, comp growth in Q3 was 16%. We estimate that warmer weather from late September onwards reduced our comp by about three points. In other words, we believe that our underlying weather adjusted comp in Q3 was about 19%. For Q4, we are currently projecting our comp performance to be in the low double digits. Our month-to-date comp is running well ahead of this. What really matters is the next four to five weeks. If the sales trend is stronger than we are ready to chase it. Then we move on now to talk about inventory levels. Comp in-store inventories were down 24% at the end of Q3. This means, they were slightly above our plan coming into the quarter. Our plan was for in-store inventories to be down in the high 20s. The other promising news is that the end of Q3 reserve inventory was 30% of total inventory, versus 21% in 2019. It is usually the case that you drain your reserve inventory in the third quarter, you pull goods out of reserve to get prepared for holiday. In fact, we built our reserve inventory in Q3. Reserve receipts in Q3 increased 174% versus the same period in 2019. We were able to make some great opportunistic buys during the quarter. It is too early to extrapolate, but we think that over the coming months, we are likely to see a very favorable buying environment as other retailers cancel late deliveries. One final point on inventories. At end of Q4, we are planning in-store inventories to be down in the mid 30% range. We believe that we can end the year more cleanly than we have in the past, and thereby transition more effectively to the spring seasons. I would like now to turn the call over to John to walk us through the financial details.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael. And good morning everyone. I'm going to follow a similar approach to Michael. I'll start by talking about our longer term financial prospects. Then I will move in nearer in and make a few comments about 2022. And then finally, I will finish up with additional color on our Q3 results and our current expectations for the fourth quarter. On the longer term as Michael described, we are very excited to announce that we will be accelerating our new store opening program. We are now planning to open 90 net new stores next year. And then from 2023 onwards, we expect to open between 100 and 120. net new stores every year. Combining this faster pace of openings with a conservative comp assumption should generate average annual top line sales growth over the next five years in the low double digit percentage range. Over this period and with these sales growth assumptions, we also believe that we can achieve 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin expansion. We've made very good progress on margin expansion this year. But this has been masked by higher freight and supply chain expenses. We expect that some of these expenses will moderate over time. But we also believe that we have the opportunity to drive further leverage, especially occupancy costs and operating expenses. This combination of sales growth in the margin expansion should drive average annual earnings growth in approximately the mid-teens. This growth estimate does not include any additional benefit from using available cash flow to repurchase shares or to pay down debt, thereby reducing interest expense. The numbers I have described are annual averages for the five year period. We anticipate significant variability in these results year-to-year. In addition, as you know, we may not plan our business each year with this level of growth. Our model is to begin each fiscal year with a more conservative plan, manage inventories and expenses accordingly, and then chase the trend in take advantage of ahead of plan sales. If we execute this model successfully, then you would expect to achieve the annual average performance matrix that I just described. Let me move on and make a few comments about 2022. As Michael described, next year is very unpredictable in terms of top line sales, and bottom line earnings. We look forward to the day when we can return to providing traditional guidance. But we are clearly not at that point yet. For 2022, we do not have enough visibility to provide meaningful guidance for the year. We are anchoring our initial buying and operating plans on a 5% comp decline. Think of this is the baseline that we are using to setup our merchants and operators. So we could chase the trend and take advantage of merchandise supply opportunities. Given what we know at this point, we would expect a 5% optic line to drive operating margin deleverage of about 150 basis points. This is based on the assumption that freight and supply chain expenses remain at their current levels through mid-2022 and then begin to moderate. This estimate also assumes no material increase in retail prices, and no other significant cost inflation. For reference, using these same assumptions, we would expect a flat comp to drive about 60 basis points of operating margin deleverage and a 3% comp to generate flat operating margins versus 2021. I would now like to talk about our Q3 performance and our Q4 outlook. As a reminder, our Q3 results are being compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Total sales in the quarter grew 30% while comp sales increased 16%. As Michael mentioned, we estimate that unseasonably warm weather in October in some of our most important regions negatively impacted our comp sales growth by about three points during the quarter. The gross margin rate was 41.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points versus 2019\u2019s third quarter rate of 42.4%. This was driven by a 180 basis point increase in trade expense, which more than offset an 80 basis point increase in merchandise margin driven by lower markdowns. Product sourcing costs were $173 million versus $90 million in the third quarter of 2019, increasing 250 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented most of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were consistent with what we have discussed in prior quarters. Adjusted SG&A was $581 million versus $486 million in 2019, decreasing 210 basis points as a percentage of sales and other income and other revenue were down by $8 million or 60 basis points as we compare to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 which benefited from $8 million of insurance recoveries. Adjusted EBIT margin was 6.1%, 180 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the non-operating other income and revenue deleverage, our adjusted EBIT margin declined 120 basis points. Said in other way, during Q3 we drove 310 basis points of operating margin expansion from merchant margin and operating expense leverage on our 16% comp. But this was more than fully offset by 490 basis points of deleverage on freight product sourcing costs and our comparison to non-recurring other income in Q3 of FY 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.20 versus $1.44 in the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily an $86 million debt extinguishment charge related to the partial redemption of our convertible notes. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.36 versus $1.53 in the third quarter of 2018. During the quarter, we open 40 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the third quarter to 832 stores. This included 56 new store openings, 15, relocations and one closure. In the fourth quarter, we have opened an additional eight new stores, and we expect to close two stores. As a result, we should end the year with 838 stores. Now I will turn to our outlook for Q4. We are projecting comp sales growth in Q4 to be in the low double digit percentage range. We are expecting the extraordinary freight and supply chain expense headwinds to continue through Q4. This means that our low double digit comp projection should translate to 250 basis points of deleverage and operating margin during the quarter. With this outlook for Q4, we now expect a full year operating margin to be flat versus 2019. It is important to reinforce the point that this means that for the full year, we will have absorbed about 360 basis points of deleverage on creating supply chain expenses, with 360 basis points of offsetting favourability and other areas of the P&L. Specifically, much higher merchant margin and significant leverage on SG&A expenses. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, John. Before we open it up to questions, I would like to recap and reinforce some key points that we have made this morning. Firstly, we think that our longer term prospects are extremely bright. So we have decided to put our foot on the gas, and we are accelerating our new store program. Secondly, we believe an inflationary price environment could drive greater traffic to our stores. We need to see how this plays out. But we think that it could offer us the opportunity to take share, take up retails or to do both. Thirdly, we anticipate that 2022 will be very unpredictable. Our playbook is to plan and manage our business. So we can aggressively chase the very significant sales margin and supply opportunities that we believe might emerge. Finally, our Q3 trend remained very strong. We chased $218 million in sales above our original plan. But we still ended the quarter with in-store inventories and reserve inventories in great shape. We are very well positioned for the fourth quarter. I would like now to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Boss: Great thanks and really appreciate all the color. So maybe first for Michael, on your long term unit growth prospects, Michael, Could you just speak to drivers behind the decision to accelerate this ramp of new store openings what gives you confidence to expand the program now?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning Matt. Thanks for your question. As you know at the beginning of this year, we raised our long term potential store count to 2000 stores. And it's really since that time we've been looking at the pace of our new store openings, how many stores we should open each year. There are three factors that led into our decision to accelerate this pace, this the first is financial. I'm sure many of the analysts on this call, have already done the math, looking at our press release this morning, to estimate new store productivity. And what you see with those numbers is our new store productivity this year, has been extremely strong. And we know that this is partly due to the same tailwinds that have driven our comp growth or this year. But even if you adjust for those tailwinds and new stores are still running well ahead of our internal hurdles. As a reference point of the 100 or so stores that we opened this year, just over half are under 30,000 square feet. So this performance really gives us a lot of confidence in our new smaller store prototype. So that's the first reason, financial. Secondly, the second factor is strategic. I talked about this in my earlier remarks, so I won't, I won't beat a dead horse. But year-to-date our business is almost a third bigger than it was in 2019. That suggests to us that the customer is really responding very well to the great value that we were offering, and that we're taking significant market share. Again, it gives us confidence that as we open more stores, over the next few years, we'll be we'll be swimming with the tide, we'll be taking share. The other major off price retailers have two to three times the number of stores that we have. So this feels like a, an opportunity that's really unique to Burlington. The third factor in making this decision was operational. We earlier this year, we put together an internal cross functional team to look at, what would it take to significantly accelerate our store expansion, that cross functional team included real estate stores, supply chain, merchandising, planning, IT and other areas. And based on the plans and actions that that team developed, we feel very comfortable that we can support the faster pace of openings that we described in the remarks. Now, obviously with new scores, you have a pipeline of new locations that goes out over the next two to three years. So we can we can look at that pipeline and actually say we're very happy with the number and the quality of store locations that we see ahead of us. So you can tell we're very excited by this opportunity.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe just a follow up for John. On the multi-year top and bottom line growth targets that you laid out on the call. Could you just share with us more of the building blocks to get to those levels of sales growth, margin expansion and EPS growth?\nJohn Crimmins: Good morning, Matt. Sure, happy to take you through a little bit more detail on that. The top line is pretty straightforward. Really, if you combine the new store program that we were talking about, with a conservative low single digit percent annual comp increase, this gets you to a low double digit percent annual sales growth that I mentioned the basis of our model. And we're confident that we can achieve this average annual growth. Moving on the margins, let's just kind of revisit what happened with margins this year. For the full year was expecting freight and product sourcing costs to delever by about 360 basis points. But as I just said in my remarks, we're projecting operating margin to be approximately flat versus 2019. So in other words, we've really driven 360 basis points with favourability and other areas. And that comes from higher merch margin driven by lower markdowns and higher leverage on operating expenses. Looking forward, there may be some additional merch margin opportunity. But because we've seen such a significant increase this year, we haven't assumed any further improvement there in our model. For store occupancy, we expect to capture additional leverage as we migrate towards our smaller store prototype. But we do see opportunities to drive further efficiency on store in supply chain expenses. We think that over time, freight expenses will decline from this year's historically high levels, though not necessarily all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. We're assuming that supply chain expenses will probably be a bit stickier. But they too will moderate to some degree as the seek flows become more predictable and reliable. When you combine all of these different factors together, we think that we can capture the 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin in the next five years that we called out. Of course, there could be additional headwinds that move against us, or there could be tailwinds that, that move in our favor, that could impact individual years during the period. But on average, we think these things should even out over time. And if we were to achieve significantly higher than the low single digit average comps we've modeled for this period, we would expect to drive more operating margin expansion. If you combine the low double digit projection for anyone top line growth, with a margin expansion of 200 basis points to 300 basis points for the next five years, then you get to the mid-teens earnings growth that I described in my prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: A couple of questions, my first question is on supply chain. Can you just talk a little bit excuse me more about the issues and how they're specifically affecting your company? And then I guess, for example, what impact has it\u2019s had on store level inventory levels? And then I have a follow up?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, I'll take that. Good morning, Ike. I think that's a great question. I know there's been a lot of reporting and some concerns about inventories. So I think it might be helpful to draw a distinction, merchandise availability and supply on the one hand and the timely delivery of receipts on the other hand. Firstly, the availability of merchandise has been continues to be very good. Of course, there are certain categories and brands where there might be constraints, but that's always true. As an off-price retailer, we're not dependent on a single crack category or brand, we're very good at moving money from businesses where there's either a weak trend or poor supply to businesses where there's strong sales and good supply opportunities. That's off price. That's kind of what we do. I think the data for Q3 provides a pretty good illustration of this. In Q3, we chased 16% comp gross on an original plan of flat. That represents about $218 [Ph] million of ahead of plan sales. But our in-store inventory levels still ended Q3 ahead of plan. And at the same time, we were able to build up our reserve inventory. So we were very happy with supplying Q3 and we continue to be happy. We think there's a good chance because supply is about to get even better. So that's supply. But let me, let me move on and talk a little bit about receipts, specifically, the timely delivery of receipts. As I just described, when you look across the whole store, we really have not had an issue with merchandise availability this year. We found great merch spent how open to buy. Well there have been challenges, and we've had these challenges along with everyone else is in the timely delivery of receipts. In other words, with goods showing up late. This isn't the vendors fault. The problems are global and very widespread. But it has created inefficiencies in our transportation and supply chain network. Ironically, those headwinds become stronger, the more you try to chase the business and respond to the trend. So there's definitely been a challenge. And it's cost us money. But we've been able to get the goods that we need. And we've been very happy with the inventory levels in our store. So to recap, your merchandise availability and supply have been very good, and we think they're going to get better. But navigating the receipt flow has been an issue and frankly, it's been expensive, but we've done it. So that's how I would drive that.\nIke Boruchow: Super helpful. Then this quick follow up on retail prices Michael, you were alluding to just, what do you see happening with prices across the industry? Do you think higher prices are sustainable? And then do you believe you guys can raise prices is this something the company has done in the past, just kind of curious how you frame all that up?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, so it's a great question, Mike. I think this situation has really evolved over the last few months and actually continues to evolve. I see two things going on right now. Firstly, full price retailers this year have been getting much higher realized prices. And it's clear why that is, it\u2019s because of much leaner inventories. Now, initially, I have to say I was sceptical on this. My view was that as soon as supply loosened up, promotions would come back. And then these higher prices would just come back down. But now, I'm not sure these retailers are clearly enjoying the stronger margins. So maybe, and I want to underline the word, maybe the environment will be less promotional going forward, maybe these retailers will control their inventories more tightly. So they can preserve the higher margins. But again, I'm going to repeat it. I'm underlining the word maybe. We really need to see what happens as supply constraints ease, do we go back to promotions or not. But if the environment really is less promotional going forward, I think that could be great for us. When we talk about value and offering value to customers, our reference point for value is the pricing at full price stores. So if that reference point moves up, if those higher realized prices really become permanent, then that that could be a huge opportunity either to drive sales or to drive margin or to do both. And frankly, that decision might depend upon a specific category that we're talking about. But I think we'll have plenty of opportunities there. If that reference product price is permanently higher. Anyway, that's one thing that's going on. The other thing that's going on, and this, this has really changed over the last few months. The prospects, it feels like the prospects for generalized price inflation across the economy have really grown. As I said in my remarks, this isn't just in the sectors that we compete in, it's also it's also food, it's gas prices, it's the cost of living. Again, we have to see what happens over the next couple of quarters. But we believe that an environment of rising prices, we could do very well, our value proposition is already very strong, but it could, it would become even stronger in that environment. And again, we think this could present us with an opportunity to drive higher sales and higher margins. Now, when you look back at the transcript to this call, you'll see that there are a lot of ifs in what I just said, a lot of maybes and a lot of ifs. So we don't really know how this will play out. We think that these trends could be very favorable to us or for us, but at this point, it makes sense to be cautious and a little patient. That said, we are making some adjustments. We've looked at our fast, very fast turning businesses and we've started to push prices up in those businesses. We've looked at businesses where we think our pricing may be sharper than it needs to be. And we've been testing some higher retails and so far, the things we've tested, the prices we've pushed up, it's worked. It's worked well. But it's fairly modest at this point. The other thing is that as you'd expect, we're also watching competitors very closely. Our merchants visit competitor stores all the time. So there are no there are no trade secrets with pricing that that price is displayed on the ticket. And actually by looking at the clearance rack, you can also see if those higher prices are working or if they're just driving markdowns. I guess, I would finish up by saying we're mindful in all this, that we are the third largest off price retailer. So clearly it wouldn't make sense for us to take the lead on raising retail prices. But we're not proud. If we see something and we believe something is working, there's really nothing to stop us from falling.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the freight and supply chain pressures. John, are you seeing any sign of easing here? And when do you think it's reasonable to see that or is it possible that this is a more permanent situation?\nJohn Crimmins: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for your question. Good question. Yes, you've heard me say in the last couple of calls. We think that this record breaking freight expenses that we've seen so far this year, are mostly temporary. We still believe that it's driven by an imbalance in supply and demand. And we think that over time it should correct itself. So, we think that's the case. But like everyone else, we don't really know when that's going to happen. And we certainly haven't seen anything yet, that would indicate that things are starting to improve. As we said previously, we think that some of the higher supply chain expenses that we've seen this year, particularly the wage rate piece are going to be more permanent. But we expect that the wage incentives and the operating efficiencies we've seen this year are going to get better. And as the supply chain situation improves, again, we just don't have good visibility into when any of this stuff is, is going to actually happen. But let's just consider the other side of it. Suppose it, it doesn't work out that way. Suppose that these higher expenses are mostly here to stay, but they become a permanent part of the expense base. We think the only way that happens is in an inflationary scenario. And so I'd refer to what Michael was, was just talking about. If costs are permanently higher than we would expect that prices would rise permanently across all retail, it's the only way that most retailers would be able to absorb the costs. And so that would certainly apply to us as well. In an inflationary burn, inflationary [Ph] situation, we'd certainly be able to raise prices, while continuing to maintain our value proposition. And in this scenario, that our value proposition would likely be even more important to our customers.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. And then you've been pretty proactive about paying down debt. But you added back the share repurchase this quarter. What should we expect in terms of capital allocation going forward?\nMichael O'Sullivan: John, I'll take that question. Thanks, Lorraine. That's a good question. Yes that we have paid down a considerable amount of debt over the last year. And I think it may be helpful to kind of provide kind of a recap of our debt pay down as well as our debt outstanding and leverage ratios. If you go back to the height of the pandemic, we borrowed 400 million on our ABL, and we raised about 1.1 billion and public market debt. But given our strong recovery over the last year, we have been able to pay down about 860 million out of the one and a half billion we borrowed during 2020. Now we pay down our ABL to zero. As you may recall, we executed a make-whole call on our high yield notes. And we recently repurchased in Q3 past quarter $160 million in convertible notes. So where does that leave us? We have about $1.6 billion in total gross debt, over $950 million on our term loan and a little under $650 million in our converts. And on a net debt basis, given the $1.2 billion and unrestricted cash we added in the quarter, that's about $400 million. So what all those numbers mean. I think it just leaves us in a much more comfortable place from a leverage perspective. And, if you look on a on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding capitalized operating leases, our gross leverage is down to 1.6 times gross debt-to-EBITDA and our net debt ratio is down to 0.4. And we would expect to continue to reduce those leverage ratios. So given that progress and reducing our leverage, we were comfortable resuming our share repurchases during the past quarter. We repurchased around $150 million of stock and that leaves us $250 million remaining on our authorization. So what do we do from here? We're going to evaluate it through the lens we always use. First and foremost, we're going to invest in our growth. And secondly, we'll utilize excess cash and the most accretive way for our shareholders and that's what we'll continue to do.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, John, David, thanks for all the guidance through next year. It's quite a bit more than we're getting for many your peers across the sector. I guess John, new store gross now a bigger part of the narrative. Be helpful if you could provide just some high level modeling assumptions around new store productivity, particularly given the new store prototype? And then I have one quick follow up.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, John. Be happy to do that. So let's start with how you should think about sales volume for our new stores. On average, we expect new stores to have initial sales volumes that are around 70% to 80% of our chain averages they open up. Obviously, there'll be some variability for each individual store. But if you use this average, should be a reasonable assumption for modeling. Actually, this year, we're seeing a slightly stronger performance than that as our new stores are outperforming their plans. They are being driven by the same tail tailwinds that have helped help us deliver our strong comp store performance. So, from there, you should anticipate comp store sales growth for the new stores, that's faster than the chain for several years after opening, which would be consistent with what we've now seen to last several years. Across the next five years, you should expect more than 75% of our new stores will be less than 30,000 square feet, so really moving to the smaller store format and in a big way. In terms of profitability and capital returns, you can rely on what we've continued to say we've been saying in the past, that EBIT margins for each store are expected to be accretive to the company in their second year, and each store is expected to deliver return on invested capital, that's also accretive to the company's return on invested capital. In 2019, our average sales per store is about $10 million. With the growth that we've seen this year, our 2021 home average sales per store is going to be north of $11 million per store. If sales of a new store is 75% of our average, that means that the store should do over 8 million, and then comp above the chain average for several years. So from a productivity perspective, in our 25,000 to 30,000 square foot stores, we're expecting over $300 a foot on a gross square foot basis in $400 a foot on the selling square foot basis. So big step forward on productivity at the store level. And even as we're paying a little more rent per foot, and many of these better high traffic locations, this level of productivity, combined with a smaller footprint, and the lower operating expense structure should really help us to drive operating margin expansion, while growing the top line faster and delivering the terrific returns that we expect from the stores. So we're really excited about our new stores. But we're also excited about the relocation opportunity that we have. The net new store numbers that we laid out today, next five years include an average of 30 reloads per year. In most cases, these are going to be moves from oversized boxes with low sales productivity, many of them older and in need of at least refreshing and moving into fresh, new, highly productive, smaller boxes with lower occupancy cost. Relocations for us usually result in a pretty healthy sales lift and improved for overall profit.\nJohn Kernan: Got it, sounds like productivity is planned to move significantly higher. I guess my follow up is just on Q4, a lot has happened since the last call in August. Could you just walk us through? What changed in the Q4 outlook versus the outlook you gave us on the last call? Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Okay, all right, John. Great, thanks. So for Q4, we said we're, we're comfortable with our sales forecast. We're actually running ahead of our low double digit sales forecast. But there's still, some risk and some really big weeks in front of us as we move into December. On the margin front, it just really comes down to wanting to be a bit more conservative on our EBIT forecast. Our implied outlook for Q4, we, if you look at what we gave last quarter, was down around 200 basis points. So now on a low double digit comp, we're forecasting down about 250 basis points. So I would remind you that we're still maintaining our flat EBIT margin forecast for the full year. The reason for this, the reality that we're dealing with is that the cost pressures in supply chain and freight and wages to some degree, along with the volatility or timing receipts, they are just really difficult to forecast with any precision. So we really wanted to recognize the difficulty forecasting these expenses and add a bit more conservatism just to protect against the volatility that we see.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great, thanks so much. I wanted to follow up on Michael, in your inventory comments. You mentioned when you were talking to inventory that you think there's a good chance that supply is about to get better. I just wondered if you could expand on that for us?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Kimberly, good to hear from you. Yes, so. So I feel like the congestion, and the delays in global supply chains and transportation systems have been have been fairly well reported. I've lost count of the number of ships that are waiting off the coast of Southern California at this point. But it seems like it just keeps hitting new records every day. And the containers, some of the containers on those ships have merchandise vendors, and retailers had ordered with the expectation that they would be delivered for the holiday period, the holiday selling period, or for the fall season. And it's clear that some of that merchandise is not going to get here on time. Frankly, if it hasn't landed by now, it's already too late. Then there is no point, for a retailer, there's no point in taking receipt of holiday merchandise in January, for example. So our expectation is that that merchandise should find itself to find its way into the off-price channel. And we think that's likely to be a big opportunity, especially for our reserve inventory. Now, I mentioned that we've started to see some early signs of that. It's too I think it's too early to project where that's going to lead. But our hunch is that the next couple of months could be could be a very good buying opportunity for off-price.\nKimberly Greenberger: Fantastic, Michael. And it sounds like you feel really good about the inventory position here for holiday. I just want to make sure that I understand you correctly on that. And then I just wanted to follow up quickly if I could on the 30,000 square foot stores. It sounds like you're seeing well above plan results, in particular this year. And I wondered if you care to share how those stores in particular, those smaller stores as a subset of your new locations, how they're delivering on annual volumes this year. Thanks so much.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Okay, I'll take the first part of that, Kimberly on for the inventory levels and then I\u2019ll let John respond on what we're doing with the prototypes. But on holiday inventory levels, at this point, obviously, we're sitting in the third week of November. So I'm in a good position to judge. I'm very confident that we will have the inventory in our stores, and that we have enough receipts on the way to stores to support our sales projection, that low double digit number. Now, if sales were to run well ahead of low double digit, then we might start to see some gaps in some very high trending businesses. But that just means that the sales in those businesses were very, very strong. So it's a high class problem. It's I think, the risk to us right now, in some ways is that sales outpace our expectations, not that we that we have an issue with, with inventory or receipts. And then John, do you want to talk about the smaller..?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes, sure. So first of all, as far as the performance of all of our new stores this year, not surprisingly, they're running well above the way that we had planned them as we underwritten them. Yes, I think everybody in retail has a strong tailwind this year. So that that's certainly a big part of it. But it also does give us some confidence to see the new stores, which include a large percentage of smaller stores, not as big as what we're moving toward. But they're all performing the way we would expect them to perform. Understanding that we have these kind of tailwinds behind us. Within the group of smaller new stores, we're very pleased with their performance. It's become less about the size and more about the strength of the trade area. If you're looking at individual stores, we've, got some of the smaller format stores that are really blowing it out of the water. And then there are others that are performing well. But overall, as far as proof-of-concept, we're very pleased with what we've seen from the smaller stores that we've opened so far.\nKimberly Greenberger: Great to hear and thanks for all of the color on the long term strategic outlook, it's really helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Crimmins: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys, thanks for all the detail today. I'll repeat the comments earlier, it's very, very helpful to hear you think through the 22 and longer term. Maybe this one's for John. But I think, important, it seems like you're drawing a pretty fine line, a pretty hard line between first half and second half next year. Is that really laughing stimulus and the costs rolling in such that obviously, we understand from your language today, the first half is really tough, the second half closer to that algorithm that you that you spoke to for the longer term? And then Michael, what really as you think about the AUR [Ph] and retails comment, what really is the governor to raising that to you. Today, I think one of your dollar store competitors said they're raising to $1.25, your price competitors are raising AUR as you point to the value in your stores being historically wide versus the full price channel? Do you need to be that wide? And how do you think about whether your share gains have come from continuing to widen that relative value spread versus the better operations we've seen from you in the stores moving, to higher traffic locations, operating the in-store inventories better? How do you gauge when you may have let that value spread widen too far, based on your comment that it's pretty wide right now?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Alright, so Mike, I'll start with the question on the kind of time and cost pressures next year. So, as I said before, we really, really don't have a crystal ball here. What we can see today is, we haven't seen anything that indicates that improvement, particularly on the freight side, yet has started. So, it's a modeling assumption that we're using, it's not something that we, that we have this inside information. But yes, so I, but I think it's a fair way to think about next year, that if you didn't see any improvement for the first half, and you start to see some improvement in the second half, that's really as deep as our thinking goes there. So and it's based on if that improvement does start to happen, that's, that's the impact that we've seen on our margins. If it doesn't start to happen, it goes back to the comments that we had, this may be more of an inflationary environment, and there may be more room to take price then we've modelled. So that's kind of the way we think about how we modeled the scenarios for next year.\nMichael Binetti: Okay.\nMichael O'Sullivan: And then, Michael, your question on what's the what are the governor's on AUR [Ph] and taking up retails? I think it's a it's a really good question. And I think it's important, it's important to understand that an off-price, what really matters is sort of the reference points for price. And what I mean by that is, when the customer walks in the store, when the customer walks in the off-price store, they're walking into that store, because they're expecting a deal. They're expecting the values to be great. And actually, we encourage that. So when you look at a price ticket at Burlington, it shows our price, but it shows a compare act or a comparable price, and that compare our price is based upon the -- out the door price at another retailer. So we're saying look, you can buy at this price of Burlington, here's what it would have cost you had you gone to this other place. So that's kind of what off what the off-price customer proposition really is. So bringing that back to your question, then how should we think about the differentiation in our prices versus the competitors? If the competitors move up prices, that gives us an umbrella to move up prices to. There's no doubt about that. It\u2019s where else is the customer going to go? That is the uncertainty that we have. And the reason we're being a little patient here is because those higher realized prices at full price stores, you've got to be sure that they are going to stay where they are. They are going to stay high before you start moving up your own prices. I've been in retail pretty long time. And I would say over the years, the department stores have been very, very promotional. So you'd have to believe now that that's going to stop. They're going to stop being promotional. So if that were to happen, if it really were the case, that department stores were going to stop promoting and they were going to hold on to those higher realized prices, then yes, we could move up our prices. But if actually this is just a short term thing, and their higher realized prices are being driven by the fact that we happened to have supply chain constraints this year and leaner inventories and that actually as supply loosens up next year those realized prices will come down, then it would have been a mistake had we raised our prices. So that that's the reason we're hesitating. Now this will all play out in the next couple of quarters, I think. So we won't have to wait long. But that's really the key driver for us. Now there is this other issue that I've mentioned in the script about well, what happens if inflation across the whole economy takes off? Well, if that happens, then obviously we're all raising prices. But that's a different drive I think. So that's how we're thinking about it.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks a lot for the help.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nAdrienne Yih: Good afternoon and good morning. And thank you again, for all the detail. A couple of quick questions here. Michael, can you talk about the proceeds health of your core target customer, if you can remind us what the target household income is, knowing that, about 50% of U.S. households are under 75K. And then what percent of your customers are non-credit or cash buyers? And then my follow up is for John, it's on the structural wage inflation embedded in long range plan. Obviously, we're sharing of 15, minimum going to 17. And just some color there. Thank you very much.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, Adrienne, I'll start with the first question. Our customer, we think our customer, we think our customer is very healthy right now. We think certainly when you look at our comps, throughout this year we feel very good about the trend that we've been able to sustain. The underlying, the customer is clearly responding very well to the values that we offer. Now, in terms of how our customer differs from other retailers customers, one thing we know about our customers is they shop at every retailer, because our customers the off-price customer cares more than anything about value. And the way they find value is they cross shop a lot. So we know that we have a huge overlap with other retailers, customers, which is why I say, if other retailers raise retails, we're probably going to have a chance to take market share, or raise our own retails because we know that, that there is cross shopping between us and other retailers. Now, to answer your question more specifically, our customers tend to skew younger, larger family size, more moderate income. And I think those customers right now, as I say, a pretty healthy and the spend the sales trend has been very strong. If I project forward to next year, and just sort of add a thought about if inflation really does take off in this economy, we actually think we may have a lot of new customers showing up, customers who are perhaps on slightly higher incomes, but they're getting squeezed by higher price inflation. So that's the reason why we feel somewhat optimistic that if there is inflation across the economy, consumers at different income levels are going to be more interested than ever, in the value that we offer.\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Okay, so I'll take the wage part of your piece, your question, Adrienne. So first of all, just to reminder, we've used this kind of market by market analysis, where we make wage adjustments, as we see that they're necessary. We've been using it for several years. And we're pleased with the way that's been working. This year, turned out much different than the way we had had planned at the start of the year. We've made some very significant changes on the DC side to remain competitive, and ensure that we can attract the workers that we need to operate our distribution centers, most of which are in New Jersey in California, very competitive markets. So we've brought wages up quite a bit there. And that's the part of our supply chain costs that we refer to as being a little bit stickier, that's now a permanent part of our wage base. And, of course, it's included in our outlook this year in our modeling. On the storage side, it's been a little bit of a different story hasn't been quite as hasn't been nearly as competitive as the DC situation. Although in the second half of the year, we have seen it get a little bit tighter and we've had to make some adjustments, a little bit higher than what we had expected at the start of the year to remain competitive, but it's very different kind of market by market. So we're still very comfortable with our market by market approach. So I would say we've taken a bigger step forward than we would normally have in a single year as far as these five market adjustments. And then modeling going forward, we've modeled in what, an assumption for what we expect we\u2019ll need to do to continue to remain competitive. And that's informed by you what we've learned about \u2013 this year.\nAdrienne Yih: Thank you. Great color and best of luck for holiday. Thank you.\nJohn Crimmins: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to Michael Sullivan, CEO for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Before we hang up, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Burlington for their hard work in the third quarter, and throughout the year. I know that the entire Burlington team shares my sense of energy and excitement around the sales margin and supply opportunity that we see ahead of us. Finally, I would like to wish everyone on today's call a very happy and peaceful Thanksgiving. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results with you in March. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael. And good morning everyone. I'm going to follow a similar approach to Michael. I'll start by talking about our longer term financial prospects. Then I will move in nearer in and make a few comments about 2022. And then finally, I will finish up with additional color on our Q3 results and our current expectations for the fourth quarter. On the longer term as Michael described, we are very excited to announce that we will be accelerating our new store opening program. We are now planning to open 90 net new stores next year. And then from 2023 onwards, we expect to open between 100 and 120. net new stores every year. Combining this faster pace of openings with a conservative comp assumption should generate average annual top line sales growth over the next five years in the low double digit percentage range. Over this period and with these sales growth assumptions, we also believe that we can achieve 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin expansion. We've made very good progress on margin expansion this year. But this has been masked by higher freight and supply chain expenses. We expect that some of these expenses will moderate over time. But we also believe that we have the opportunity to drive further leverage, especially occupancy costs and operating expenses. This combination of sales growth in the margin expansion should drive average annual earnings growth in approximately the mid-teens. This growth estimate does not include any additional benefit from using available cash flow to repurchase shares or to pay down debt, thereby reducing interest expense. The numbers I have described are annual averages for the five year period. We anticipate significant variability in these results year-to-year. In addition, as you know, we may not plan our business each year with this level of growth. Our model is to begin each fiscal year with a more conservative plan, manage inventories and expenses accordingly, and then chase the trend in take advantage of ahead of plan sales. If we execute this model successfully, then you would expect to achieve the annual average performance matrix that I just described. Let me move on and make a few comments about 2022. As Michael described, next year is very unpredictable in terms of top line sales, and bottom line earnings. We look forward to the day when we can return to providing traditional guidance. But we are clearly not at that point yet. For 2022, we do not have enough visibility to provide meaningful guidance for the year. We are anchoring our initial buying and operating plans on a 5% comp decline. Think of this is the baseline that we are using to setup our merchants and operators. So we could chase the trend and take advantage of merchandise supply opportunities. Given what we know at this point, we would expect a 5% optic line to drive operating margin deleverage of about 150 basis points. This is based on the assumption that freight and supply chain expenses remain at their current levels through mid-2022 and then begin to moderate. This estimate also assumes no material increase in retail prices, and no other significant cost inflation. For reference, using these same assumptions, we would expect a flat comp to drive about 60 basis points of operating margin deleverage and a 3% comp to generate flat operating margins versus 2021. I would now like to talk about our Q3 performance and our Q4 outlook. As a reminder, our Q3 results are being compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Total sales in the quarter grew 30% while comp sales increased 16%. As Michael mentioned, we estimate that unseasonably warm weather in October in some of our most important regions negatively impacted our comp sales growth by about three points during the quarter. The gross margin rate was 41.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points versus 2019's third quarter rate of 42.4%. This was driven by a 180 basis point increase in trade expense, which more than offset an 80 basis point increase in merchandise margin driven by lower markdowns. Product sourcing costs were $173 million versus $90 million in the third quarter of 2019, increasing 250 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented most of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were consistent with what we have discussed in prior quarters. Adjusted SG&A was $581 million versus $486 million in 2019, decreasing 210 basis points as a percentage of sales and other income and other revenue were down by $8 million or 60 basis points as we compare to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 which benefited from $8 million of insurance recoveries. Adjusted EBIT margin was 6.1%, 180 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the non-operating other income and revenue deleverage, our adjusted EBIT margin declined 120 basis points. Said in other way, during Q3 we drove 310 basis points of operating margin expansion from merchant margin and operating expense leverage on our 16% comp. But this was more than fully offset by 490 basis points of deleverage on freight product sourcing costs and our comparison to non-recurring other income in Q3 of FY 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.20 versus $1.44 in the third quarter of 2019, driven primarily an $86 million debt extinguishment charge related to the partial redemption of our convertible notes. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.36 versus $1.53 in the third quarter of 2018. During the quarter, we open 40 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the third quarter to 832 stores. This included 56 new store openings, 15, relocations and one closure. In the fourth quarter, we have opened an additional eight new stores, and we expect to close two stores. As a result, we should end the year with 838 stores. Now I will turn to our outlook for Q4. We are projecting comp sales growth in Q4 to be in the low double digit percentage range. We are expecting the extraordinary freight and supply chain expense headwinds to continue through Q4. This means that our low double digit comp projection should translate to 250 basis points of deleverage and operating margin during the quarter. With this outlook for Q4, we now expect a full year operating margin to be flat versus 2019. It is important to reinforce the point that this means that for the full year, we will have absorbed about 360 basis points of deleverage on creating supply chain expenses, with 360 basis points of offsetting favourability and other areas of the P&L. Specifically, much higher merchant margin and significant leverage on SG&A expenses. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Michael for closing remarks. Good morning, Matt. Sure, happy to take you through a little bit more detail on that. The top line is pretty straightforward. Really, if you combine the new store program that we were talking about, with a conservative low single digit percent annual comp increase, this gets you to a low double digit percent annual sales growth that I mentioned the basis of our model. And we're confident that we can achieve this average annual growth. Moving on the margins, let's just kind of revisit what happened with margins this year. For the full year was expecting freight and product sourcing costs to delever by about 360 basis points. But as I just said in my remarks, we're projecting operating margin to be approximately flat versus 2019. So in other words, we've really driven 360 basis points with favourability and other areas. And that comes from higher merch margin driven by lower markdowns and higher leverage on operating expenses. Looking forward, there may be some additional merch margin opportunity. But because we've seen such a significant increase this year, we haven't assumed any further improvement there in our model. For store occupancy, we expect to capture additional leverage as we migrate towards our smaller store prototype. But we do see opportunities to drive further efficiency on store in supply chain expenses. We think that over time, freight expenses will decline from this year's historically high levels, though not necessarily all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. We're assuming that supply chain expenses will probably be a bit stickier. But they too will moderate to some degree as the seek flows become more predictable and reliable. When you combine all of these different factors together, we think that we can capture the 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin in the next five years that we called out. Of course, there could be additional headwinds that move against us, or there could be tailwinds that, that move in our favor, that could impact individual years during the period. But on average, we think these things should even out over time. And if we were to achieve significantly higher than the low single digit average comps we've modeled for this period, we would expect to drive more operating margin expansion. If you combine the low double digit projection for anyone top line growth, with a margin expansion of 200 basis points to 300 basis points for the next five years, then you get to the mid-teens earnings growth that I described in my prepared remarks. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for your question. Good question. Yes, you've heard me say in the last couple of calls. We think that this record breaking freight expenses that we've seen so far this year, are mostly temporary. We still believe that it's driven by an imbalance in supply and demand. And we think that over time it should correct itself. So, we think that's the case. But like everyone else, we don't really know when that's going to happen. And we certainly haven't seen anything yet, that would indicate that things are starting to improve. As we said previously, we think that some of the higher supply chain expenses that we've seen this year, particularly the wage rate piece are going to be more permanent. But we expect that the wage incentives and the operating efficiencies we've seen this year are going to get better. And as the supply chain situation improves, again, we just don't have good visibility into when any of this stuff is, is going to actually happen. But let's just consider the other side of it. Suppose it, it doesn't work out that way. Suppose that these higher expenses are mostly here to stay, but they become a permanent part of the expense base. We think the only way that happens is in an inflationary scenario. And so I'd refer to what Michael was, was just talking about. If costs are permanently higher than we would expect that prices would rise permanently across all retail, it's the only way that most retailers would be able to absorb the costs. And so that would certainly apply to us as well. In an inflationary burn, inflationary [Ph] situation, we'd certainly be able to raise prices, while continuing to maintain our value proposition. And in this scenario, that our value proposition would likely be even more important to our customers. Yes, sure. So first of all, as far as the performance of all of our new stores this year, not surprisingly, they're running well above the way that we had planned them as we underwritten them. Yes, I think everybody in retail has a strong tailwind this year. So that that's certainly a big part of it. But it also does give us some confidence to see the new stores, which include a large percentage of smaller stores, not as big as what we're moving toward. But they're all performing the way we would expect them to perform. Understanding that we have these kind of tailwinds behind us. Within the group of smaller new stores, we're very pleased with their performance. It's become less about the size and more about the strength of the trade area. If you're looking at individual stores, we've, got some of the smaller format stores that are really blowing it out of the water. And then there are others that are performing well. But overall, as far as proof-of-concept, we're very pleased with what we've seen from the smaller stores that we've opened so far. You're welcome. Yes. Okay, so I'll take the wage part of your piece, your question, Adrienne. So first of all, just to reminder, we've used this kind of market by market analysis, where we make wage adjustments, as we see that they're necessary. We've been using it for several years. And we're pleased with the way that's been working. This year, turned out much different than the way we had had planned at the start of the year. We've made some very significant changes on the DC side to remain competitive, and ensure that we can attract the workers that we need to operate our distribution centers, most of which are in New Jersey in California, very competitive markets. So we've brought wages up quite a bit there. And that's the part of our supply chain costs that we refer to as being a little bit stickier, that's now a permanent part of our wage base. And, of course, it's included in our outlook this year in our modeling. On the storage side, it's been a little bit of a different story hasn't been quite as hasn't been nearly as competitive as the DC situation. Although in the second half of the year, we have seen it get a little bit tighter and we've had to make some adjustments, a little bit higher than what we had expected at the start of the year to remain competitive, but it's very different kind of market by market. So we're still very comfortable with our market by market approach. So I would say we've taken a bigger step forward than we would normally have in a single year as far as these five market adjustments. And then modeling going forward, we've modeled in what, an assumption for what we expect we'll need to do to continue to remain competitive. And that's informed by you what we've learned about \u2013 this year. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our usual approach on these calls is to structure our remarks in a chronological order, starting with a review of the most recent quarter, then moving on to the next quarter and the year ahead, and finally commenting on the longer term outlook. Today, we're going to take a slightly different approach, rather than chronologically, we will cover these topics in order of their importance to our long-term shareholder value. I will begin with our longer term expectations. The timeframe for these remarks will be the next five years. Then, I will move nearer in and talk about 2022. We think that 2022 is going to be very unpredictable. That said, we believe it could provide the ideal setup for our business. Finally, I will comment on our Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Okay, the longer term. There are two aspects of the longer term that I would like to talk about. Number one, the macro economic and competitive environment. And number two, progress we are making on our Burlington 2.0 strategy. On the macroeconomic and competitive environment, let's start with the customer. For many years, there has been a growing consumer focus on value. It is possible that we are entering a period, a prolonged period of consumer price inflation across the whole economy. We believe that in inflationary periods, consumers trade down not up. In an environment of rising prices, we think shoppers will be even more attracted to the great value that we offer. Our business is a third bigger now than it was in 2019. One reason for this is that our value differentiation versus other retailers has grown. The delta between the price of an item at Burlington and the price of a line item at a full price store has never been greater. Leaner inventories in the full price channel have driven higher realized prices. It is not clear if these higher prices will be sustained. If they are sustained, then in the coming quarters, we think that we may have the opportunity to capture additional market share, to take up our retail prices or to do both. If on the other hand, retailers returned to more promotional habits, then these higher realized prices in the full price channel will come down. If that were to happen, then we think it would trigger yet another wave of consolidation of marginally profitable for price, bricks and mortar stores. We anticipate that the second scenario, a return to a promotional environment and a decline in realized prices is the more likely, but it's going to take some time to see how this plays out. But in either scenario, we think that the long term implications for Burlington are very favorable. I would like to talk now about the progress that we are making on Burlington 2.0. The core of this strategy is to make our business as flexible as possible, so we can chase the sales trends, take advantage of supply opportunities, and deliver great value to our customers. So far this year, we have changed from a comp plan of flat to an actual year-to-date comp of 18% versus 2019. In addition to comp growth, we are very excited about our new store performance, especially our smaller store prototype. In 2021, we have opened 101 new stores. This translates to 77 net new stores after closures and relocations. Our new stores are performing extremely well. And I am excited to announce that we have decided to accelerate our new store opening program. In 2022, we expect to open about 120 new stores, which after closures and relocations should yield about 90 net new stores. Beyond 2022, we now expect to open 130 to 150. new stores each year. About 30 of these will be relocations of older stores to newer, smaller price prototype locations. So overall, from 2023 onwards, we expect to open 100 to 120 net new stores each year. Today, we have just over 800 stores. So in the next five years, this program will drive a very exciting transformation of our chain. Moving closer in, I would like to talk now about 2022. We think that there are three factors that could make 2022 a very good year for Burlington. But all three factors are difficult to predict. Firstly, sales. This year, all retailers have benefited from onetime items like stimulus checks and pent up demand. As we get into 2022 and lack these items, it seems likely that conference across retail will fall off sharply. On the other hand, it is possible that rising wage rates or further government spending will offset this decline. We have to be ready for either scenario. Secondly, pricing. As I said a moment ago, we don't yet know if higher realized prices at full price retailers will be sustained. This will play out in 2022. If these higher prices are sustained even a supply loosens up, then we think we will have a tremendous opportunity to drive sales or to take up retails or to do both. And if there is a general rise in inflation across the whole economy, then this opportunity could be even greater. Thirdly, we do not know if the issues with global supply chains will ease in 2022. If they do, then this could have a huge beneficial impact on off-price supply. And it could also drive significantly lower freight and supply chain expenses. We don't have great visibility on any of these three items. No one does. But in this situation, our playbook is always to plan our business conservatively and be ready to chase. So our initial buying and operating plans for 2022 are anchored on a mid-single digit comp decline. This is not a prediction of what we think will happen. We do not have enough visibility for reliable prediction. You should think of the minus 5% comp as a baseline a starting point for the chase. In 2021 our baseline was a flat comp. Year-to-date we have chased sales 18 points above this baseline. As for our margins, so much depends on freight and supply chain expenses. Again, we can see that we do not know how these will play out. We think that these expenses should start to come down in 2022. But we don't know if, when, and how much this will happen. In a moment, John will share our margin estimates, assuming that these costs remain at their current levels through mid-2022 and then begin to moderate. I'm going to wrap up my remarks with a few comments on our Q3 performance and our Q4 outlook. As described in today's press release, comp growth in Q3 was 16%. We estimate that warmer weather from late September onwards reduced our comp by about three points. In other words, we believe that our underlying weather adjusted comp in Q3 was about 19%. For Q4, we are currently projecting our comp performance to be in the low double digits. Our month-to-date comp is running well ahead of this. What really matters is the next four to five weeks. If the sales trend is stronger than we are ready to chase it. Then we move on now to talk about inventory levels. Comp in-store inventories were down 24% at the end of Q3. This means, they were slightly above our plan coming into the quarter. Our plan was for in-store inventories to be down in the high 20s. The other promising news is that the end of Q3 reserve inventory was 30% of total inventory, versus 21% in 2019. It is usually the case that you drain your reserve inventory in the third quarter, you pull goods out of reserve to get prepared for holiday. In fact, we built our reserve inventory in Q3. Reserve receipts in Q3 increased 174% versus the same period in 2019. We were able to make some great opportunistic buys during the quarter. It is too early to extrapolate, but we think that over the coming months, we are likely to see a very favorable buying environment as other retailers cancel late deliveries. One final point on inventories. At end of Q4, we are planning in-store inventories to be down in the mid 30% range. We believe that we can end the year more cleanly than we have in the past, and thereby transition more effectively to the spring seasons. I would like now to turn the call over to John to walk us through the financial details. Thank you, John. Before we open it up to questions, I would like to recap and reinforce some key points that we have made this morning. Firstly, we think that our longer term prospects are extremely bright. So we have decided to put our foot on the gas, and we are accelerating our new store program. Secondly, we believe an inflationary price environment could drive greater traffic to our stores. We need to see how this plays out. But we think that it could offer us the opportunity to take share, take up retails or to do both. Thirdly, we anticipate that 2022 will be very unpredictable. Our playbook is to plan and manage our business. So we can aggressively chase the very significant sales margin and supply opportunities that we believe might emerge. Finally, our Q3 trend remained very strong. We chased $218 million in sales above our original plan. But we still ended the quarter with in-store inventories and reserve inventories in great shape. We are very well positioned for the fourth quarter. I would like now to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Well, good morning Matt. Thanks for your question. As you know at the beginning of this year, we raised our long term potential store count to 2000 stores. And it's really since that time we've been looking at the pace of our new store openings, how many stores we should open each year. There are three factors that led into our decision to accelerate this pace, this the first is financial. I'm sure many of the analysts on this call, have already done the math, looking at our press release this morning, to estimate new store productivity. And what you see with those numbers is our new store productivity this year, has been extremely strong. And we know that this is partly due to the same tailwinds that have driven our comp growth or this year. But even if you adjust for those tailwinds and new stores are still running well ahead of our internal hurdles. As a reference point of the 100 or so stores that we opened this year, just over half are under 30,000 square feet. So this performance really gives us a lot of confidence in our new smaller store prototype. So that's the first reason, financial. Secondly, the second factor is strategic. I talked about this in my earlier remarks, so I won't, I won't beat a dead horse. But year-to-date our business is almost a third bigger than it was in 2019. That suggests to us that the customer is really responding very well to the great value that we were offering, and that we're taking significant market share. Again, it gives us confidence that as we open more stores, over the next few years, we'll be we'll be swimming with the tide, we'll be taking share. The other major off price retailers have two to three times the number of stores that we have. So this feels like a, an opportunity that's really unique to Burlington. The third factor in making this decision was operational. We earlier this year, we put together an internal cross functional team to look at, what would it take to significantly accelerate our store expansion, that cross functional team included real estate stores, supply chain, merchandising, planning, IT and other areas. And based on the plans and actions that that team developed, we feel very comfortable that we can support the faster pace of openings that we described in the remarks. Now, obviously with new scores, you have a pipeline of new locations that goes out over the next two to three years. So we can we can look at that pipeline and actually say we're very happy with the number and the quality of store locations that we see ahead of us. So you can tell we're very excited by this opportunity. Yes, I'll take that. Good morning, Ike. I think that's a great question. I know there's been a lot of reporting and some concerns about inventories. So I think it might be helpful to draw a distinction, merchandise availability and supply on the one hand and the timely delivery of receipts on the other hand. Firstly, the availability of merchandise has been continues to be very good. Of course, there are certain categories and brands where there might be constraints, but that's always true. As an off-price retailer, we're not dependent on a single crack category or brand, we're very good at moving money from businesses where there's either a weak trend or poor supply to businesses where there's strong sales and good supply opportunities. That's off price. That's kind of what we do. I think the data for Q3 provides a pretty good illustration of this. In Q3, we chased 16% comp gross on an original plan of flat. That represents about $218 [Ph] million of ahead of plan sales. But our in-store inventory levels still ended Q3 ahead of plan. And at the same time, we were able to build up our reserve inventory. So we were very happy with supplying Q3 and we continue to be happy. We think there's a good chance because supply is about to get even better. So that's supply. But let me, let me move on and talk a little bit about receipts, specifically, the timely delivery of receipts. As I just described, when you look across the whole store, we really have not had an issue with merchandise availability this year. We found great merch spent how open to buy. Well there have been challenges, and we've had these challenges along with everyone else is in the timely delivery of receipts. In other words, with goods showing up late. This isn't the vendors fault. The problems are global and very widespread. But it has created inefficiencies in our transportation and supply chain network. Ironically, those headwinds become stronger, the more you try to chase the business and respond to the trend. So there's definitely been a challenge. And it's cost us money. But we've been able to get the goods that we need. And we've been very happy with the inventory levels in our store. So to recap, your merchandise availability and supply have been very good, and we think they're going to get better. But navigating the receipt flow has been an issue and frankly, it's been expensive, but we've done it. So that's how I would drive that. Yes, so it's a great question, Mike. I think this situation has really evolved over the last few months and actually continues to evolve. I see two things going on right now. Firstly, full price retailers this year have been getting much higher realized prices. And it's clear why that is, it's because of much leaner inventories. Now, initially, I have to say I was sceptical on this. My view was that as soon as supply loosened up, promotions would come back. And then these higher prices would just come back down. But now, I'm not sure these retailers are clearly enjoying the stronger margins. So maybe, and I want to underline the word, maybe the environment will be less promotional going forward, maybe these retailers will control their inventories more tightly. So they can preserve the higher margins. But again, I'm going to repeat it. I'm underlining the word maybe. We really need to see what happens as supply constraints ease, do we go back to promotions or not. But if the environment really is less promotional going forward, I think that could be great for us. When we talk about value and offering value to customers, our reference point for value is the pricing at full price stores. So if that reference point moves up, if those higher realized prices really become permanent, then that that could be a huge opportunity either to drive sales or to drive margin or to do both. And frankly, that decision might depend upon a specific category that we're talking about. But I think we'll have plenty of opportunities there. If that reference product price is permanently higher. Anyway, that's one thing that's going on. The other thing that's going on, and this, this has really changed over the last few months. The prospects, it feels like the prospects for generalized price inflation across the economy have really grown. As I said in my remarks, this isn't just in the sectors that we compete in, it's also it's also food, it's gas prices, it's the cost of living. Again, we have to see what happens over the next couple of quarters. But we believe that an environment of rising prices, we could do very well, our value proposition is already very strong, but it could, it would become even stronger in that environment. And again, we think this could present us with an opportunity to drive higher sales and higher margins. Now, when you look back at the transcript to this call, you'll see that there are a lot of ifs in what I just said, a lot of maybes and a lot of ifs. So we don't really know how this will play out. We think that these trends could be very favorable to us or for us, but at this point, it makes sense to be cautious and a little patient. That said, we are making some adjustments. We've looked at our fast, very fast turning businesses and we've started to push prices up in those businesses. We've looked at businesses where we think our pricing may be sharper than it needs to be. And we've been testing some higher retails and so far, the things we've tested, the prices we've pushed up, it's worked. It's worked well. But it's fairly modest at this point. The other thing is that as you'd expect, we're also watching competitors very closely. Our merchants visit competitor stores all the time. So there are no there are no trade secrets with pricing that that price is displayed on the ticket. And actually by looking at the clearance rack, you can also see if those higher prices are working or if they're just driving markdowns. I guess, I would finish up by saying we're mindful in all this, that we are the third largest off price retailer. So clearly it wouldn't make sense for us to take the lead on raising retail prices. But we're not proud. If we see something and we believe something is working, there's really nothing to stop us from falling. John, I'll take that question. Thanks, Lorraine. That's a good question. Yes that we have paid down a considerable amount of debt over the last year. And I think it may be helpful to kind of provide kind of a recap of our debt pay down as well as our debt outstanding and leverage ratios. If you go back to the height of the pandemic, we borrowed 400 million on our ABL, and we raised about 1.1 billion and public market debt. But given our strong recovery over the last year, we have been able to pay down about 860 million out of the one and a half billion we borrowed during 2020. Now we pay down our ABL to zero. As you may recall, we executed a make-whole call on our high yield notes. And we recently repurchased in Q3 past quarter $160 million in convertible notes. So where does that leave us? We have about $1.6 billion in total gross debt, over $950 million on our term loan and a little under $650 million in our converts. And on a net debt basis, given the $1.2 billion and unrestricted cash we added in the quarter, that's about $400 million. So what all those numbers mean. I think it just leaves us in a much more comfortable place from a leverage perspective. And, if you look on a on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding capitalized operating leases, our gross leverage is down to 1.6 times gross debt-to-EBITDA and our net debt ratio is down to 0.4. And we would expect to continue to reduce those leverage ratios. So given that progress and reducing our leverage, we were comfortable resuming our share repurchases during the past quarter. We repurchased around $150 million of stock and that leaves us $250 million remaining on our authorization. So what do we do from here? We're going to evaluate it through the lens we always use. First and foremost, we're going to invest in our growth. And secondly, we'll utilize excess cash and the most accretive way for our shareholders and that's what we'll continue to do. Thanks, John. Be happy to do that. So let's start with how you should think about sales volume for our new stores. On average, we expect new stores to have initial sales volumes that are around 70% to 80% of our chain averages they open up. Obviously, there'll be some variability for each individual store. But if you use this average, should be a reasonable assumption for modeling. Actually, this year, we're seeing a slightly stronger performance than that as our new stores are outperforming their plans. They are being driven by the same tail tailwinds that have helped help us deliver our strong comp store performance. So, from there, you should anticipate comp store sales growth for the new stores, that's faster than the chain for several years after opening, which would be consistent with what we've now seen to last several years. Across the next five years, you should expect more than 75% of our new stores will be less than 30,000 square feet, so really moving to the smaller store format and in a big way. In terms of profitability and capital returns, you can rely on what we've continued to say we've been saying in the past, that EBIT margins for each store are expected to be accretive to the company in their second year, and each store is expected to deliver return on invested capital, that's also accretive to the company's return on invested capital. In 2019, our average sales per store is about $10 million. With the growth that we've seen this year, our 2021 home average sales per store is going to be north of $11 million per store. If sales of a new store is 75% of our average, that means that the store should do over 8 million, and then comp above the chain average for several years. So from a productivity perspective, in our 25,000 to 30,000 square foot stores, we're expecting over $300 a foot on a gross square foot basis in $400 a foot on the selling square foot basis. So big step forward on productivity at the store level. And even as we're paying a little more rent per foot, and many of these better high traffic locations, this level of productivity, combined with a smaller footprint, and the lower operating expense structure should really help us to drive operating margin expansion, while growing the top line faster and delivering the terrific returns that we expect from the stores. So we're really excited about our new stores. But we're also excited about the relocation opportunity that we have. The net new store numbers that we laid out today, next five years include an average of 30 reloads per year. In most cases, these are going to be moves from oversized boxes with low sales productivity, many of them older and in need of at least refreshing and moving into fresh, new, highly productive, smaller boxes with lower occupancy cost. Relocations for us usually result in a pretty healthy sales lift and improved for overall profit. Okay, all right, John. Great, thanks. So for Q4, we said we're, we're comfortable with our sales forecast. We're actually running ahead of our low double digit sales forecast. But there's still, some risk and some really big weeks in front of us as we move into December. On the margin front, it just really comes down to wanting to be a bit more conservative on our EBIT forecast. Our implied outlook for Q4, we, if you look at what we gave last quarter, was down around 200 basis points. So now on a low double digit comp, we're forecasting down about 250 basis points. So I would remind you that we're still maintaining our flat EBIT margin forecast for the full year. The reason for this, the reality that we're dealing with is that the cost pressures in supply chain and freight and wages to some degree, along with the volatility or timing receipts, they are just really difficult to forecast with any precision. So we really wanted to recognize the difficulty forecasting these expenses and add a bit more conservatism just to protect against the volatility that we see. Sure. Well, good morning, Kimberly, good to hear from you. Yes, so. So I feel like the congestion, and the delays in global supply chains and transportation systems have been have been fairly well reported. I've lost count of the number of ships that are waiting off the coast of Southern California at this point. But it seems like it just keeps hitting new records every day. And the containers, some of the containers on those ships have merchandise vendors, and retailers had ordered with the expectation that they would be delivered for the holiday period, the holiday selling period, or for the fall season. And it's clear that some of that merchandise is not going to get here on time. Frankly, if it hasn't landed by now, it's already too late. Then there is no point, for a retailer, there's no point in taking receipt of holiday merchandise in January, for example. So our expectation is that that merchandise should find itself to find its way into the off-price channel. And we think that's likely to be a big opportunity, especially for our reserve inventory. Now, I mentioned that we've started to see some early signs of that. It's too I think it's too early to project where that's going to lead. But our hunch is that the next couple of months could be could be a very good buying opportunity for off-price. Okay, I'll take the first part of that, Kimberly on for the inventory levels and then I'll let John respond on what we're doing with the prototypes. But on holiday inventory levels, at this point, obviously, we're sitting in the third week of November. So I'm in a good position to judge. I'm very confident that we will have the inventory in our stores, and that we have enough receipts on the way to stores to support our sales projection, that low double digit number. Now, if sales were to run well ahead of low double digit, then we might start to see some gaps in some very high trending businesses. But that just means that the sales in those businesses were very, very strong. So it's a high class problem. It's I think, the risk to us right now, in some ways is that sales outpace our expectations, not that we that we have an issue with, with inventory or receipts. And then John, do you want to talk about the smaller..? Alright, so Mike, I'll start with the question on the kind of time and cost pressures next year. So, as I said before, we really, really don't have a crystal ball here. What we can see today is, we haven't seen anything that indicates that improvement, particularly on the freight side, yet has started. So, it's a modeling assumption that we're using, it's not something that we, that we have this inside information. But yes, so I, but I think it's a fair way to think about next year, that if you didn't see any improvement for the first half, and you start to see some improvement in the second half, that's really as deep as our thinking goes there. So and it's based on if that improvement does start to happen, that's, that's the impact that we've seen on our margins. If it doesn't start to happen, it goes back to the comments that we had, this may be more of an inflationary environment, and there may be more room to take price then we've modelled. So that's kind of the way we think about how we modeled the scenarios for next year. And then, Michael, your question on what's the what are the governor's on AUR [Ph] and taking up retails? I think it's a it's a really good question. And I think it's important, it's important to understand that an off-price, what really matters is sort of the reference points for price. And what I mean by that is, when the customer walks in the store, when the customer walks in the off-price store, they're walking into that store, because they're expecting a deal. They're expecting the values to be great. And actually, we encourage that. So when you look at a price ticket at Burlington, it shows our price, but it shows a compare act or a comparable price, and that compare our price is based upon the -- out the door price at another retailer. So we're saying look, you can buy at this price of Burlington, here's what it would have cost you had you gone to this other place. So that's kind of what off what the off-price customer proposition really is. So bringing that back to your question, then how should we think about the differentiation in our prices versus the competitors? If the competitors move up prices, that gives us an umbrella to move up prices to. There's no doubt about that. It's where else is the customer going to go? That is the uncertainty that we have. And the reason we're being a little patient here is because those higher realized prices at full price stores, you've got to be sure that they are going to stay where they are. They are going to stay high before you start moving up your own prices. I've been in retail pretty long time. And I would say over the years, the department stores have been very, very promotional. So you'd have to believe now that that's going to stop. They're going to stop being promotional. So if that were to happen, if it really were the case, that department stores were going to stop promoting and they were going to hold on to those higher realized prices, then yes, we could move up our prices. But if actually this is just a short term thing, and their higher realized prices are being driven by the fact that we happened to have supply chain constraints this year and leaner inventories and that actually as supply loosens up next year those realized prices will come down, then it would have been a mistake had we raised our prices. So that that's the reason we're hesitating. Now this will all play out in the next couple of quarters, I think. So we won't have to wait long. But that's really the key driver for us. Now there is this other issue that I've mentioned in the script about well, what happens if inflation across the whole economy takes off? Well, if that happens, then obviously we're all raising prices. But that's a different drive I think. So that's how we're thinking about it. Yes, Adrienne, I'll start with the first question. Our customer, we think our customer, we think our customer is very healthy right now. We think certainly when you look at our comps, throughout this year we feel very good about the trend that we've been able to sustain. The underlying, the customer is clearly responding very well to the values that we offer. Now, in terms of how our customer differs from other retailers customers, one thing we know about our customers is they shop at every retailer, because our customers the off-price customer cares more than anything about value. And the way they find value is they cross shop a lot. So we know that we have a huge overlap with other retailers, customers, which is why I say, if other retailers raise retails, we're probably going to have a chance to take market share, or raise our own retails because we know that, that there is cross shopping between us and other retailers. Now, to answer your question more specifically, our customers tend to skew younger, larger family size, more moderate income. And I think those customers right now, as I say, a pretty healthy and the spend the sales trend has been very strong. If I project forward to next year, and just sort of add a thought about if inflation really does take off in this economy, we actually think we may have a lot of new customers showing up, customers who are perhaps on slightly higher incomes, but they're getting squeezed by higher price inflation. So that's the reason why we feel somewhat optimistic that if there is inflation across the economy, consumers at different income levels are going to be more interested than ever, in the value that we offer. Before we hang up, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Burlington for their hard work in the third quarter, and throughout the year. I know that the entire Burlington team shares my sense of energy and excitement around the sales margin and supply opportunity that we see ahead of us. Finally, I would like to wish everyone on today's call a very happy and peaceful Thanksgiving. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results with you in March. Thank you."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are going to structure this morning's discussion as follows: First, I will review our second quarter results; second, I will discuss the outlook for the second half of fiscal 2021; and third, I will share some comments on our ESG initiatives and our most recent corporate social responsibility report. After that, I will hand the call over to John, to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. As a reminder, the results that we discuss today are being compared to the equivalent period in 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic last year, our 2020 results do not provide a good basis for comparability. Okay. So let's talk about our results. Total sales grew 34% in the second quarter, which followed a 35% increase in Q1. Think about that. We grew our sales by over a third versus the first half of 2019. This is compelling evidence that our Burlington 2.0 initiatives are working and that we are taking significant market share as the consumer and the broader economy begin to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now, I will talk about comp store sales. Comparable store sales in the second quarter increased 19%. We believe that there were several factors that drove this very strong comp performance. These factors included, number one, the residual impact of the Federal stimulus payments that were distributed in March.  Number two, pent up demand as the Covid vaccines became more widely available during the quarter and consumer spending picked up. Number three, the beginning of the monthly child tax credit payments in July. And number four, our own very strong execution of our Burlington 2.0 strategies.  Turning to category and regional performance, once again, our strength in the second quarter was a very broad based. All of our major merchandise categories easily outperformed their plans. And comp store sales in all regions of the country were well ahead of our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter increased by 80, that\u2019s eight zero basis points. This was despite a 120 basis point increase in freight expense.  Of course, this means that our merchandise margin grew by a very robust 200 basis points. This increase was once again driven by lower markdowns. The buying environment in the second quarter was very favorable and we were able to find great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead of plan sales trend.  At quarter end, our in-store inventory levels were down 7% on a comp store basis. This is a relatively modest decrease compared to recent quarters and it reflects a deliberate strategy. In fact, we chose to accelerate back-to-school receipts to ensure that global supply chain challenges did not impede our ability to take advantage of the sales opportunity that we see for the back-to-school period.  To better understand how we managed our inventories during the second quarter, it is more instructive to look at our average weekly comp store inventories. These were down 25% during the quarter.  For the balance of fiscal 2021, you should expect to see similar double-digit decreases in comp store inventory. As you know, this is a core element of our Burlington 2.0 strategy to run with leaner inventories and to ensure a fresher assortment in front of the customer. Reserve inventory was 31% of our total inventory at the end of the second quarter versus 33% in the 2019 period.  Again, this end of quarter metric does not convey the full story. We have continued to significantly expand our use of reserve inventory as a tool to chase the sales trend. In fact, our reserve receipts during Q2 increased 86%, while our reserve releases increased 64%. In other words, there is a lot more movement in and out of reserve than that was in 2019.  In the second quarter, we were able to make some great opportunistic and strategic buys to put into reserve. But, at the same time, we moved up the release of other goods from reserve to fuel our strong sales trend.  Moving on to new store performance. We are very pleased with the initial rollout of our new smaller store prototype. During the spring season, we opened 16 stores that were 30,000 square feet or less and the earlier results are extremely encouraging. As you know, we expect this smaller format to become our main new store prototype over the next couple of years.  As a point of information, one of these recent openings is in Patchogue, New York. This is very close to those of you who live in the New York City area. So I encourage you to visit, walk the floor, spend some money, and of course, let me know what you think.  In a moment, I will talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, but before I do that, now that the results of the second quarter are in, I would like to briefly review our performance for the year-to-date, in other words, for the spring season, as a whole.  As a retailer, we break the year into two halves, building our plans and strategies for the first half of the year, the spring season, and then separately, building our plans and strategies for the second half of the year, the fall season.  So I think it is helpful and instructive to step back and ask, how well did our strategies work in the spring season, and how well did we execute on these strategies? Also by looking at the season as a whole, this naturally flattens some of the timing issues that can affect or distort one quarter or another.  So, how did we do? Well, for the spring season, Q1 and Q2 combined, our top-line sales growth was 34%. Our comp store sales growth was 20%. Our operating margin grew by 240 basis points and our adjusted earnings per share was ahead by 73%.  Look, we know this was not all us. There were one-time factors such as the Federal stimulus payments and the release of pent-up consumer demand. There is no doubt that these one-time factors helped drive our results. They helped drive every retailer\u2019s results. That said, we feel very good about our own performance on an absolute and on a relative basis.  With that said, let me turn to our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2021. Based on our stronger than expected year-to-date results, we have increased our baseline plan for comp store sales for the fall season as a whole from our previous plan of flat to a new plan of plus 10% comp growth.  We are already 3.5 weeks into the quarter, and I am happy to report that our August month-to-date sales trend is currently running well ahead of this. We are chasing the trend and we have growing confidence that we will exceed this 10% hurdle for Q3. As we get further into the quarter, we will update and adjust our baseline plan. But for now, there are significant reasons to remain cautious.  At this point, the surge in COVID cases driven by the delta variant shows no signs of letting up. And it is unclear what impact this may have on consumer spending in the weeks ahead. In this environment, it makes sense to plan our business conservatively and then adjust as we learn more. Throughout this year, we have demonstrated our extraordinary ability to chase the sales trend. We will do the same in the fall season if the sales trend is there.  Moving on from the sales outlook, I would like to spend some time talking about the extraordinary freight and supply chain expense pressures that we are seeing. For several quarters now, there has been a significant imbalance in global transportation systems between demand and available capacity.  This has caused unprecedented volatility and disruption in deliveries of merchandise across all sectors of retail and it has caused a significant spike in international and domestic freight rates. As we move into Q3 and the peak period for retail deliveries, the situation is getting much worse. Again, this is not at all unique to Burlington. These conditions are affecting all retailers.  Based on our experience and success so far this year, we are confident that despite these issues, we will be able to get timely receipt of the merchandise that we need to support our trend. But in doing this, we expect to incur significantly higher freight and supply chain expenses.  As John will detail in a moment, we are anticipating some offsets to these higher expenses. In particular, continued lockdown savings driven by faster inventory turns and leverage on other expenses if we achieve our sales plans. But overall, these higher logistics costs will put significant pressure on our operating margins.  Before I leave this topic, it is important to make the point that the issue I have just described the huge imbalance between demand and available capacity in transportation systems is being driven by short-term factors.  On the one hand, the surge in consumer demand in the United States and on the other hand, the limited capacity of domestic and international transportation systems further hampered by labor shortages and restrictions associated with the pandemic.  We do not believe that this imbalance or these factors are permanent. It will not happen right away, but we expect these issues to normalize over time. As they normalize, we would anticipate that freight rates will come back down. We also believe that if the situation normalizes there could be a significant backlog of merchandise that makes its way into the off-price channel.  Okay. Before I turn the call over to John, there is one other very important topic that I would like to touch on. Earlier this week, we published our Third Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. We are very proud of this report and the accomplishments and progress that it describes.  As a company, we recognize that driving shareholder value is extremely important, but it should not be the only thing that we focus on and it cannot be the only objective that we measure ourselves against. We have a much broader set of responsibilities, to our associates, to our customers and to the communities that we serve. These are all critically important stakeholders.  We believe that by serving these stakeholders, we will build a stronger, better, and more sustainable company. And that in doing this, we will further enhance and drive shareholder value over the longer term. The CSR report that we published earlier this week is intended to back up these words with specific details on the programs that we are pursuing and data on the progress that we are making.  It covers important topics like inclusion and diversity, community outreach and support, and environmental sustainability. To be clear, while we are proud of our commitment and our accomplishments, we regard this as a journey and we know that we have plenty of work still to do.  I would encourage you all to take a look at the report, which is available on our Investor Relations website and I invite you to follow-up with us if you have questions or would like more information.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance. John? \nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  For the second quarter, total sales grew 34%, while comparable store sales increased by 19%. The gross margin rate was 42.2%, an increase of 80 basis points versus 2019\u2019s second quarter rate of 41.4%. This improvement was driven by an approximately 200 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns.  This merchandise margin improvement more than offset the significant increase in trade expense, which was approximately 120 basis points higher than 2019\u2019s second quarter rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods to our supply chain and buying costs were $146 million versus $82 million in the second quarter of 2019 increasing 160 basis points as a percentage of sales.  Higher supply chain cost accounted for nearly all of the deleverage. The drivers of this expense pressure were consistent with what we had seen in Q4 and Q1. Higher wage rates and wage incentives and the disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain.  Adjusted SG&A was $550 million versus $441 million in 2019, decreasing 170 basis points as a percentage of sales. SG&A leverage was primarily due to leverage in occupancy and store payroll. Adjusted EBIT margin increased to 8.3%, 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.50 versus $1.26 in the second quarter of 2019.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.94 versus $1.36 in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 43%. During the quarter, we opened eight net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the second quarter to 792 stores. This included eleven new store openings, one relocation, and two closures. This brings us to total store openings of 37 gross and 31 net for the spring.  We still expect to open 100 new stores in fiscal 2021 while closing or relocating 25 stores for a net addition of 75 stores. We ended the period with available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion including approximately $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and $534 million of availability on our ABL.  Our total balance sheet debt is now $1.8 billion, which includes $961 million on our term loan and $805 million in convertible notes with no outstanding balance on our ABL. During the second quarter, we executed a make-whole call for the $300 million outstanding of our 6.25%, 2025 senior secured notes.  Additionally, during the second quarter, we refinanced our term loan extending the maturity to June 2028 from November 2024, while our interest rate spread increased modestly by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 200 basis points. We continue to remain hedged on $450 million with a $961 million notional value.  We extended our current interest rate swap through a blend and extend transaction moving the maturity of the swap out to June 2028 and lowering the LIBOR rate on the swap from 2.72% to 2.19%. Our previous share repurchase authorization expired earlier this month and our Board recently approved a new $400 million authorization that expires in August 2023.  As we've said in the past, our first priority remains investing in our long-term growth and reducing our leverage. We are pleased with the recent reduction in our leverage and the progress we've made over the last nine months, paying down to $400 million previously outstanding our ABL by the end of fiscal 2020 and retiring our $300 million in senior care notes in June.  Looking ahead, we are focused on deploying excess cash where we see the most accretive use.  Now, I will turn to our outlook. Despite the recent strength of our business, the outlook remains very unpredictable. So, we are not providing specific sales or earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021. But as we did on our last earnings call, we would like to share some high level comments on how we are thinking about our financial performance for the second half of 2021.  Like other retailers, we are seeing significant incremental pressure from freight and supply chain costs. As we discussed on our first quarter call, these pressures impact us primarily in three areas: first, ocean freight; the capacity versus demand imbalance for all imports has continued to worsen and has driven related costs well past what we have been anticipating.  These higher rates affect our margin on all merchandise. The small portion of our business that we directly import and the merchandise that is imported by the vendors we buy from.  Second, domestic freight. A very similar story. Demand far exceed supply for all modes of transportation and as the situation is continuing to worsen rates have continued to escalate well past what we have been anticipating.  And third, supply chain costs. This demand has far exceeded what most retailers have planned for. The competition to increased staffing levels to meet the higher volumes has driven wages higher again.  Our expected increase in supply chain costs is driven partly by additional base wage increases, partly by temporary incentives and partly by inefficiencies caused by the overall disruption in the global supply chain.  With that as background, let's move to some specifics.  As Michael mentioned earlier, we will continue to plan sales conservatively and adjust our business to the trends that we see just as we did in the first half of fiscal 2021.  Our current baseline comp sales plan for the second half of the year is a 10% increase. As Michael mentioned earlier, given our strong start to the quarter, we have growing confidence that Q3 may exceed this hurdle, but we will keep our fall baseline comp sales plan at 10% until we are further along that had better visibility as to what to expect in the fourth quarter.  Based on this revised comp store plan for the fall season, combined with our better than expected Q2 comp sales results, we are now planning for our full year comp store sales increase of 14% versus our previous plan for a 7% increase.  As you think about total sales growth for the full fiscal year versus FY 2019, remember to factor in two years of new stores over this time period. We opened 31 net stores during the first half and we expect to open 44 net new stores in the second half of this year, primarily in Q3.  The growth in new store and non-comp sales, combined with our updated full year comp baseline assumption of 14% would potentially deliver approximately 28% total sales growth for the full fiscal year. Given the dynamic and volatile cost environment, we are facing, it's difficult to provide specific margin metrics for the balance of this year. However, we thought it might be helpful to share some of our internal modeling assumptions for Q3.  If, we were to hit our baseline top sales plan of 10% in Q3, then our modeling suggests that our EBIT margin would decline by approximately250 basis points, driven by 450 basis points, combined freight and product sourcing cost deleverage.  Offsetting that cost pressure, we would expect 200 basis points of combined merchandise margin expansion and SG&A expense leverage.  On our last earnings call, we shared that with the Q1 results and our planning assumptions of the10% comp in Q2 and flat comp in Q3 and Q4, we would expected a full year EBIT margin decline of 20 to 30 basis points, compared to fiscal 2019.  Now, after factoring in our Q2 results, our new 10% comp sales planning assumption for the fall season and the significant incremental freight and supply chain cost pressures our modeling assumptions result in relatively flat EBIT margins for fiscal 2021.  We do expect most of the deleveraging impact of freight and supply chain cost to be temporary and the global supply chain capacity in demand are more imbalanced, we would expect to see an operating margin tailwind, but it\u2019s not yet clear when to expect that to happen.  Two final points before I turn the call back to Michael. First, please keep in mind that these comments we are making on our planning assumptions are intended to help you understand how we are modeling our business.  As we said earlier, we expect the business environment in the second half of the year to continue to be very difficult to predict for sales demand and for freight and supply chain costs. Our planning assumptions are based on estimates that may not be accurate.  Second, we wanted to reinforce a point we made on last quarter's call. As you update your model for 2022, it'll be very important to back out the impact of one-time sales benefits from external factors such as the Federal stimulus checks in Q1, the pent-up demand we saw in Q2 and the additional benefit from the Child Tax Credits for the balance of 2021. Of course, we will provide more information on our 2022 sales outlook later this year or early next year.  With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, John. Let me wrap up my remarks by congratulating the entire Burlington family for our exceptional performance in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2021. As I\u2019ve said before, this is a really exciting time to be at the company. We have very strong momentum. We are building and strengthening our team and we are achieving results that are at the top of our retail peer group.  Our 34% total sales growth year-to-date reinforces our confidence and our ability to take significant market share over time. Meanwhile, despite the temporary expense headwinds that we are placing, we remain very excited about our ability to significantly expand operating margins over the next few years.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss. Your line is now open. \nMatthew Boss : Great. Thanks and congrats on another nice quarter. Michael, maybe first on the top-line. Could you just help quantify or provide any additional color around some of the factors that drove your second quarter comp growth? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. As you'll probably recall, in the - for the first quarter, we estimate that the impact of the Federal stimulus checks as being worth 10 to 15 points of comp growth. That analysis was fairly straightforward. The checks were sent out over a very short time period in March of this year and we could see the sales lift in the days and the weeks that followed. So the analysis wasn't hard and we're fairly confident about that estimate.  For Q2 As I said in the script, there were several factors that drove \u2013 what we think drove our comp growth including probably a residual impact from those stimulus checks, plus pent-up demand as life started to get back to normal in Q2. And then the Child Tax Credit payments that were made later in the quarter.  We certainly tried to quantify the impact of each of those, but it was much more difficult. For example, how do you quantify pent-up demand. So, we don't really have an estimate that we can share for Q2. But nevertheless, I would say, we are fairly sure that the impact of those items was pretty significant. The reason that that's important is that, is that all of those items are non-recurring.  This year, these factors have been like a rising tide. They've lifted all retailers. In 2022, we would expect that that tide is going to recede. And so, as John said earlier, as you think about sales models for 2022, it will be very important to back out the significant impact of those one-time items, not just for us but for every retailer. \nMatthew Boss : Great. And then, maybe just a follow-up on freight and supply chain expenses for John. Could you just help provide some color on the higher freight and supply chain expenses that you are seeing today and then maybe more so, what makes you think that these costs are temporary? \nJohn Crimmins: Well, thanks, Matt. Good morning. It's a really good question. I think it's worth taking a couple of minutes to explain in some detail what we're seeing. Coming into this year, we and really all other retailers were tentative and somewhat conservative in our sales plans, nobody was really sure what to expect driven by the government stimulus payments, pent-up consumer demand and other one-time factors, sales levels across the retail industry have gone well beyond what anyone would have expected six months ago.  Faced with this surge in demand, all retailers have been competing with each other for capacity along really every link of the global supply chain. The competition for that capacity has driven rates at unprecedented levels.  Just as an example that the spot rate for shipping a container from China to a West Coast port shortly before the pandemic has been running around $1,500 bucks. To do that now, it cost $15,000 and the rates are still increasing.  There aren't enough containers. There aren't enough ships. There aren\u2019t enough trucks or trains. There is more volume now than any part of the supply chain pipes can adequately handle. Every piece of the pipe is slower and that our backlogs to work through every step of the way.  To work around these issues most retailers have increase their orders and tried to accelerate them ahead of the fall and holiday season. This has even further increased the pressure on the supply chain, helping to drive even higher rates.  The companies that can afford to, the additional costs are worth incurring temporarily because even after covering these costs, the added operating profit is accretive even if it temporarily hurts operating margins.  Temporarily, maybe the keyword in this situation we believe and most economists seem to agree that this situation will moderate over time as demand subside and as capacity is added. So, like many others, we think the global supply chain issues will likely carry into next year, but at some point the imbalance between demand on the one hand and capacity in the other will start to correct itself.  When this happens, we would expect freight and the rest of the temporary cost related to the disruption and the DC labor shortage to become a tailwind for most companies including us. And remember, while it continues, we do expect the disruption to help us to be able to continue to find plenty of terrific merchandise values for our customers. \nMatthew Boss : Thanks for all the color and congrats again on the continued momentum guys. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks Matt. \nJohn Crimmins: Thanks Matt. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson. Your line is now open. \nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. John, you achieved similar comp growth in the first and second quarters. But your operating margin expansion was much stronger in 1Q. Can you take us through the factors that drove this difference between the quarters? \nJohn Crimmins: Sure, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Let me just frame the question a little bit and then I'll answer it. So, EBIT margin expanded 350 basis points in the first quarter and only 110 basis points in the second quarter. So that's about a 250 basis point difference, obviously on a very similar comp level.  So why is that? Well, gross margin was really the key driver of the difference, expanding only 80 basis points in the second quarter versus 230 basis points in the first. So, that's a 150 basis points of the difference.  Markdowns was a big driver of the gross margin difference. And this wasn't unexpected for us. You may remember that during the first quarter call, we said that the markdown improvement in Q1 would not be sustainable. Q1 was kind of unique. We were comparing to the first quarter of 2019 that had quite a bit of clearance activity.  Historically, first quarter had been a weak gross margin quarter for us. We often carried over holiday clearance merchandise from the fall, which dragged our first quarter margin down and this did happen to us in the first quarter of 2019. But in the first quarter of 2021, we started with incredibly fresh and lean inventory.  And then, with the well above planned 20% comp in the first quarter, our inventory turns increased nearly 60%, which we also said would not be sustainable. And it turns out we are right, our inventory turns did slow down in Q2, but they still improved by a very respectable 49%. Aside from gross margin, the remaining 100 basis points difference was largely driven by less SG&A leverage.  Most of that was driven by less advertising leverage in Q2, compared to Q1, and more deleverage from incentive comp in the second quarter. \nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. And then, my second question is for Michael related to pricing. Several retailers have talked recently about taking up prices to offset some of these cost pressures. What are you seeing in terms of pricing in the market? And could this be an opportunity for Burlington as well? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Great to hear from you. I would say that we are very skeptical about the ability of retailers to sustainably raise prices across the categories that we can compete in. There are really two reasons for that skepticism. Firstly, it's important to grow a distinction between higher realized prices in the short-term versus permanently higher prices longer term.  It's clear the inventory levels across the retail industry have been very lean this year and as a consequence, there has been very little promotional activity. That means, that realized prices have been higher for many retailers. But we just don't think that's sustainable.  The realized prices are higher up because inventories are lean but the only reason that inventories are lean is that there has been a huge surge in consumer demand at the same time as supply chains have been constrained. So, we think that when the situation normalizes, it's likely realized prices will come back down to more like historical levels.  That's the first reason we're skeptical. The second the second factor that maybe feeding into this is that the - is a spike in freight and supply chain costs. If you believe that those costs are permanent and I think you could make a good case that retailers may try to pass those costs on in the form of higher prices, but as we said in the remarks and as John just described, we think those costs are mostly about a moment in time, a short-term imbalance between demand and capacity.  It is just picking up on one of the data points that John shared earlier, ocean freight rates are about ten times higher now than they were in 2019. That is not because operating a ship or paying a dock yard worker is ten times higher. It's because demand exceeds capacity. That imbalance won't last. It will normalize. So, we think any price increase that's based on those short-term costs, again it's just not likely to be sustainable.  So that's our assessment. Now, let me wrap up my answer by saying, we could be wrong. Maybe prices across retail really will move up in the next year or two and to be clear, we wouldn't mind at all for an off-price retailer like us that would be terrific. It would help to further expand our value differentiation. Through the lens of Burlington 2.0, we would see this as a great opportunity to drive sales, not to drive margin, but to drive sales. \nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Lorraine\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow. Your line is now open. \nIke Boruchow: Hey. Good morning, Michael, John, David. Michael, a question for you to start. Just couple long-term questions actually. Just, I guess, based on the comments today, I am curious if you could help us on how you are thinking about 2022, given what you are up against in 2021. Is there a way you could help us understand how you are planning the business next year in anyway?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Ike. Yes. Thank you. It's a very good question. Having just done a 20% comp for the spring of 2021, it is pretty challenging to think about well, how should we plan spring of 2022. We are getting to a point where we are starting to work on that, because typically, as we move into October November, we start working on our plans for the following spring.  I don't have a lot of details to share. But let me do this. Let me offer up a possible scenario to 2022 in terms of what the year could look like. We think that it's possible that 2022 will be a very difficult and turbulent year across the retail industry and I'm not saying that with any sense of doom or pessimism on the contrary difficult turbulent years in retail are often very good for off-price.  So as I sort of lay out why we think the year could be difficult and you should interpret this as me feeling upbeat and not the opposite. So, really two reasons why I am saying I think 2022 could be a difficult year in retail. But the first reason we kind of touched on earlier, in 2021, every retailer has benefited from significant one-time items that have driven much higher sales levels than they otherwise would have achieved.  When retailers anniversary those items in 2022, comps could welfare negative that mathematically that seems very lightly. Secondly, in 2021, that surge in sales was accompanied by global supply chain constraints and very lean inventory levels, which means that many retailers have seen just a remarkable recovery in margins.  Again, if you scroll forward to 2022, if consumer demand does falloff and it's likely that those supply chain constraints are going to ease. So you could see an increase in the flow of merchandise into the country. At the very time the comp sales trends have turned negative. Now the scenario I've just described, a negative sales trend across retail and a loose out supply of merchandise could create huge disruption.  But the consequences for off-price and for Burlington 2.0 in particular, we think it'd be very favorable. It could offer the potential to further accelerate our ability to take share. Now, I don't want over tell the scenario I've just described for the past eighteen months have demonstrated that there are serious hazards to anyone making predictions.  So, but that\u2019s actually - that's kind of the point. For 2022 given the uncertainty, we think that we're going to need to be very flexible and very nimble. So we can respond to any scenario we face including the scenario I just described and if there is an opportunity, so that we can - we're in position to take advantage of it. \nIke Boruchow: Got it. So a follow-up, actually, just you heated it up pretty well, to take advantage, it seems like having a lot of with the Burlington 2.0 strategy. Are there aspects of the strategy that you could accelerate or leverage you guys could pull or accelerate going forward you get this is in fact, how the environment actually shakes out? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes. So, it's a really good question. In fact, for the last several months, I've been working with the executive team on exactly this question. Can we move faster? Again, I don't have a detailed answer, but let me offer up a few comments.  Number one, we're mindful that we're building a company for the long-term here where everything we do needs to be done in a very high quality way. So we are not going to accelerate anything if we have to compromise how well we do it. That's point number one.  Point number two, I would say that there are there are areas where if the opportunity presents itself, then we will absolutely move faster. The best example of this is the investment we're making in our merchandising organization. If we see strong talents in the market or strong flow talent in the market, we'll move on it very quickly. We won't be held back by existing hiring plans or budgets.  And then, I guess, the third point is that there are or there may be some other initiatives that we can accelerate. But we need to do more homework first before we make a decision to formally adjust our plans. The key thing, I guess, bringing it back to this year, the key thing is that, for the balance of 2021, we need to focus heavily on doing what we've been doing, offering great value, planning the business conservatively and being ready to change.  So, we'll certainly in parallel, sort of work on some of those longer term opportunities and possibly accelerating some of those longer term opportunities. But then our main focus for the next six months needs to be to keep doing what we are doing. It's been a winning game for us, so far of this year. \nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks so much. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan. Your line is now open. \nJohn Kernan: Good morning, Michael, John, David. Congrats on strong execution and huge market share gains here. I have a couple of questions for John. First, can you just give us more color on the operating margin outlook based on the freight and supply chain cost? It sounds like for the full year 2021, you expect operations - operating margins to be flat on a 14 comp.  How do we think about the margin structure going forward? Do you still see the same opportunity you saw several months ago to increase margins over time? \nJohn Crimmins: That\u2019s okay. Well, first of all, good morning, John. Thanks for your question. I'll start with the first part, this year's is EBIT margin. Back in May, when we spoke, we shared that freight and supply chain costs were rising faster than what we had originally planned for. And while we had planned for these costs to continue to increase, we underestimated the magnitude of the increase.  It looks considerably worse now than it did then. So, today, we shared our Q3 adjusted EBIT margin outlook is down 250 basis points on a ten comp. Our updated full year adjusted EBIT margin plan implies a similar decline for Q4, based on our updated fall comp plan of 10%. Our strong first half margin rate performance is being roughly offset in the back half as we do expect operating margins to be down by over 200 basis points if we perform in line with our 10% comp planning assumption for the fall.  And yes, assuming a 10% comp performance for the fall, we would expect our operating margin rate to be flat. This full year performance is driven by 450 points of deleverage, mostly from freight and supply chain costs and to a lesser degree by the incentive comps cost.  We expect to be able to fully offset these costs with about 450 basis points of combined gross margin expansion, driven by lower markdowns and leverage on SG&A cost. So while the impact of these incremental costs and this year's operating margin is disappointing, there are few other things to keep in mind.  Our updated planning assumptions that we shared today, if realized would deliver 28% total sales growth with the flat operating margin that would mean 28% EBIT dollar growth also. And as we've mentioned a few times today, we think that with the exception of some permanent changes in DC wage rates, the rest of the drivers, the 450 BPS of deleverage are temporary, we estimate the DC wage deleverage impact in these estimates to be less 100 BPS of that 450.  So, for the second part of your question, how do we think about operating margins going forward? Well, we still see fundamentally the same long-term operating margin opportunity that we've been describing. We expect freight supply chain cost to improve. We expect to continue to drive faster inventory turns, which should result in lower markdowns.  We expect to see occupancy leverage increase accelerated by our new smaller stores and we see opportunities to drive better operational efficiency creating other expense leverage. So, yes, we still see the same path to the continued operating margin expansion that that we've been talking about. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. That was a lot of detail. Thank. I have another one for you, John. It sounds like you're excited about what you're seeing with the new smaller prototype. Is there any more you can tell us about the new store format? Any detail on how the unit economics of these stores compare to the older larger format? \nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, John. We are really excited about the performance of all of our new stores. But particularly, the 16 stores we opened this spring that are 30,000 square feet or smaller. Most of them are about 25,000 feet - 25,000 square feet. Some of them are actually a bit smaller. On average, this group of new stores that we opened this spring are running well ahead of our underwriting targets. And this is - it's also true for the group of smaller stores.  One of the most exciting things about this smaller store format is the potential it has to help us improve leverage and occupancy costs. As I just mentioned, it's a big part of our long-term margin opportunity. But the hypothesis there is always been that we can drive similar sales volumes in smaller, less expensive boxes, that's going to help us drive operating margin expansion.  Still early days, but what we've seen so far with the new batch of smaller stores is really encouraging and it only strengthens our confidence in the potential of the new format. And now that we have several of these stores open, we should have enough of this sample to begin to work through the learning curves of how to best operate in the smaller size.  The economics in the new stores should be a great operating margin tailwind and the availability to boxes in the size range should provide plenty of very attractive sites for future new stores. So, yes, we're really pleased with what we've seen so far this year. \nJohn Kernan: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is now open. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Very nice quarter here. I wanted to just come back to one of the comments that you've made on the call today that August here is running well ahead of the 10% comp plan here for the third quarter.  I am wondering, if you can just give us a little more color on trends here for Q3. What are you seeing in your business? And as you look out to the balance of Q3, I know you'll monitor the business, but what are the risks and opportunities as you see them for the quarter? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. So, good morning, Kimberly. It's Michael. I'll take that question. It's a good question. And I can see ordinarily after such a strong start to the quarter, we would have taken up the plan for the quarter by now. But in this particular situation, we're being a little cautious, I think for two reasons. The first I kind of mentioned in the remarks that the surge in COVID cases related to the Delta variant.  Now so far, there is absolutely no evidence that that had any impact on our business. But if the situation deteriorates, then obviously that could change. So that's one reason to be in a little bit cautious. The second reason we're being a little bit cautious is the third quarter, much more so than any other quarter of the year weather that really matters.  Given I know we've talked about this before, given our legacy of as Burlington Coat Factory, I would say that the good or bad, weather affects us in the third quarter most - more than it does most other retailers. When weather turns cooler, shoppers naturally think of outerwear.  And so, if the weather turns cooler, earlier in the quarter, and that really helps us versus other retailers, if on the other hand, it remains warm until later in the quarter, then that can hurt us. Right now, most of the long range forecasts, weather forecasts are saying that October and even November could be unusually warm.  We never really know how much face to place in those forecasts. So that they could be wrong, but it makes sense for us given that outlook to be cautious in Q3. If the forecasts are wrong, we know that we can chase and actually, in our reserve inventory, we have a pretty good outerwear position. So, if the weather did turn cool out sooner, then we would chase the trend. \nKimberly Greenberger: Fantastic. That's great color, Michael. Thank you for that. And John, just a follow-up on that. If in the third quarter, for example, you were able to deliver a 15 comp instead of your 10 plan, how would that change your outlook for the - and maybe just take it to the second half of the year? How would that change your outlook for the operating margin decline? \nJohn Crimmins: Sure, Kimberly. A good question. So I'm going answer the question in two pieces. So, if we were to perform that at 15 comp, obviously, yes, that would give us an opportunity to get some additional leverage on our fixed cost base that component of SG&A and which we're already showing really good leverage.  And it would also help our gross margin performance because we would expect to drive even lower markdowns on a higher sales demand. So that part of \u2013 the way that we would typically think about we our flow through on incremental sales is very much in place. It's even there. If you look at the 10 comp, even though it's a flat margin, you were getting 450 basis points of leverage on a full year performance on our SG&A and on our gross margin.  It's just all been eaten up by the product sourcing cost, supply chain cost and some incentive comp. So, we're very comfortable with that part of our algorithm. But the freight and supply chain costs are very difficult to predict. So, I don't want to give you an exact how it would flow through, because we just don't know. We think we have some pretty conservative assumptions in here realistic.  But, it's just not clear how that situation is going to play out and that's why we\u2019ve stayed away from giving specific guidance. \nKimberly Greenberger: Understood. Thank you so much. \nJohn Crimmins: Okay. Thanks, Kimberly. \nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Michael Binetti. Your line is now open. \nMichael Binetti : Hey guys. I would add my congrats on a nice quarter and thanks for all the detail here today. So the merch margins were 200 basis points lower in 2Q. Sorry, up in 2Q, but were low \u2013 I am sorry, they were up - less than 1Q. I am curious, Michael, if you just maybe give us some comment on what drove that moderation. And then I think you said 3Q would be 200 basis points from both merchandise margin and SG&A leverage.  So it seems like you are baking in further moderation of the merch margin in the third quarter in the second half, but given how tight supply chains are and inventories that you spoken to are getting back up into the market, I am trying to think what - what would be some of the incremental headwinds to merch margin as you look at to the plan in the second half? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. So, good morning, Michael. Yes, everything you said is correct in terms of the comparisons of the quarters. So, we saw a nice merch margin improvement in Q2, but it wasn't as big as the improvement in Q1. That's really driven by the point that John was making earlier that Q1 was with the anomaly. Q1 we were much cleaner coming into Q1 than we've been historically. And as a result, we took off fewer markdowns in Q1. So that was really - that was really what drove that difference between Q1 and Q2.  Looking forward to the back half, obviously, our back half baseline comp assumption is a 10% percent comp. If we do a 20% comp in the back half of the year, I would be hoping or I would be expecting much stronger inventory turns, much stronger markdowns and as it drives a stronger, merch margin performance than we've indicated.  Just linking this though to the point you\u2019re making about availability of merchandise, I would say that so far this year, availability has been pretty good - pretty good. We've had no problem - across our business, we had no problem overall chasing our receipts here. We've gone from a - we started the year with a flat comp as a plan and we've obviously at 20. So we\u2019ve been quite nimble to find the goods.  As I think about the backlog in supply chains, I think the availability is going to get better, much better even than the pretty good availability we've seen. But I think that improvement in availability may not happen for a few months. We are going to get into a point here probably in October, something like that when goods that have been ordered that haven't arrived in the United States aren't going to make it for holiday.  And I think at that point, it could be a good - a good buying opportunity for off-price. But, we'll see. And a lot of that merchandise we would end up putting in reserve anyway. But, we do think there is going to be some opportunities in the months ahead. \nMichael Binetti : Is it safe - thanks for that, Michael. Is it safe to say that the - even on the pathway and the inventory in the channel as you spoke about I think earlier in the remarks you mentioned the reserves - your intake of reserves inventory was up, I think 86%.  Do you - would that suggest that in August you are seeing the ability to continue bringing in reserve flows at a bit of a slower pace and then - but you have confidence that it picks up through the quarter? Or what kind of a pace relative to that 86 that you assume as you thought about the 10 comps? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes. It's a good question. We are kind of assuming that that reserve inventory over the next month or two is going to kind of come in at a similar rate to what we've been experiencing. But we do think that there is a buying opportunity down the road, probably though for merchandise that we wouldn't necessarily flow to stores.  So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily hit the 10 comp. Some of it might, but most of it might be packed away for the next year, because it would be seasonal merchandise. \nMichael Binetti : Okay. Thanks a lot again guys. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Michael. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Question-and-Answer Session. I will now turn the call over to Michael O'Sullivan for closing remarks. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in November to discuss our third quarter results. Thanks again. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a review of the income statement. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  For the second quarter, total sales grew 34%, while comparable store sales increased by 19%. The gross margin rate was 42.2%, an increase of 80 basis points versus 2019's second quarter rate of 41.4%. This improvement was driven by an approximately 200 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns.  This merchandise margin improvement more than offset the significant increase in trade expense, which was approximately 120 basis points higher than 2019's second quarter rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods to our supply chain and buying costs were $146 million versus $82 million in the second quarter of 2019 increasing 160 basis points as a percentage of sales.  Higher supply chain cost accounted for nearly all of the deleverage. The drivers of this expense pressure were consistent with what we had seen in Q4 and Q1. Higher wage rates and wage incentives and the disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain.  Adjusted SG&A was $550 million versus $441 million in 2019, decreasing 170 basis points as a percentage of sales. SG&A leverage was primarily due to leverage in occupancy and store payroll. Adjusted EBIT margin increased to 8.3%, 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.50 versus $1.26 in the second quarter of 2019.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.94 versus $1.36 in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 43%. During the quarter, we opened eight net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the second quarter to 792 stores. This included eleven new store openings, one relocation, and two closures. This brings us to total store openings of 37 gross and 31 net for the spring.  We still expect to open 100 new stores in fiscal 2021 while closing or relocating 25 stores for a net addition of 75 stores. We ended the period with available liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion including approximately $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and $534 million of availability on our ABL.  Our total balance sheet debt is now $1.8 billion, which includes $961 million on our term loan and $805 million in convertible notes with no outstanding balance on our ABL. During the second quarter, we executed a make-whole call for the $300 million outstanding of our 6.25%, 2025 senior secured notes.  Additionally, during the second quarter, we refinanced our term loan extending the maturity to June 2028 from November 2024, while our interest rate spread increased modestly by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 200 basis points. We continue to remain hedged on $450 million with a $961 million notional value.  We extended our current interest rate swap through a blend and extend transaction moving the maturity of the swap out to June 2028 and lowering the LIBOR rate on the swap from 2.72% to 2.19%. Our previous share repurchase authorization expired earlier this month and our Board recently approved a new $400 million authorization that expires in August 2023.  As we've said in the past, our first priority remains investing in our long-term growth and reducing our leverage. We are pleased with the recent reduction in our leverage and the progress we've made over the last nine months, paying down to $400 million previously outstanding our ABL by the end of fiscal 2020 and retiring our $300 million in senior care notes in June.  Looking ahead, we are focused on deploying excess cash where we see the most accretive use.  Now, I will turn to our outlook. Despite the recent strength of our business, the outlook remains very unpredictable. So, we are not providing specific sales or earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021. But as we did on our last earnings call, we would like to share some high level comments on how we are thinking about our financial performance for the second half of 2021.  Like other retailers, we are seeing significant incremental pressure from freight and supply chain costs. As we discussed on our first quarter call, these pressures impact us primarily in three areas: first, ocean freight; the capacity versus demand imbalance for all imports has continued to worsen and has driven related costs well past what we have been anticipating.  These higher rates affect our margin on all merchandise. The small portion of our business that we directly import and the merchandise that is imported by the vendors we buy from.  Second, domestic freight. A very similar story. Demand far exceed supply for all modes of transportation and as the situation is continuing to worsen rates have continued to escalate well past what we have been anticipating.  And third, supply chain costs. This demand has far exceeded what most retailers have planned for. The competition to increased staffing levels to meet the higher volumes has driven wages higher again.  Our expected increase in supply chain costs is driven partly by additional base wage increases, partly by temporary incentives and partly by inefficiencies caused by the overall disruption in the global supply chain.  With that as background, let's move to some specifics.  As Michael mentioned earlier, we will continue to plan sales conservatively and adjust our business to the trends that we see just as we did in the first half of fiscal 2021.  Our current baseline comp sales plan for the second half of the year is a 10% increase. As Michael mentioned earlier, given our strong start to the quarter, we have growing confidence that Q3 may exceed this hurdle, but we will keep our fall baseline comp sales plan at 10% until we are further along that had better visibility as to what to expect in the fourth quarter.  Based on this revised comp store plan for the fall season, combined with our better than expected Q2 comp sales results, we are now planning for our full year comp store sales increase of 14% versus our previous plan for a 7% increase.  As you think about total sales growth for the full fiscal year versus FY 2019, remember to factor in two years of new stores over this time period. We opened 31 net stores during the first half and we expect to open 44 net new stores in the second half of this year, primarily in Q3.  The growth in new store and non-comp sales, combined with our updated full year comp baseline assumption of 14% would potentially deliver approximately 28% total sales growth for the full fiscal year. Given the dynamic and volatile cost environment, we are facing, it's difficult to provide specific margin metrics for the balance of this year. However, we thought it might be helpful to share some of our internal modeling assumptions for Q3.  If, we were to hit our baseline top sales plan of 10% in Q3, then our modeling suggests that our EBIT margin would decline by approximately250 basis points, driven by 450 basis points, combined freight and product sourcing cost deleverage.  Offsetting that cost pressure, we would expect 200 basis points of combined merchandise margin expansion and SG&A expense leverage.  On our last earnings call, we shared that with the Q1 results and our planning assumptions of the10% comp in Q2 and flat comp in Q3 and Q4, we would expected a full year EBIT margin decline of 20 to 30 basis points, compared to fiscal 2019.  Now, after factoring in our Q2 results, our new 10% comp sales planning assumption for the fall season and the significant incremental freight and supply chain cost pressures our modeling assumptions result in relatively flat EBIT margins for fiscal 2021.  We do expect most of the deleveraging impact of freight and supply chain cost to be temporary and the global supply chain capacity in demand are more imbalanced, we would expect to see an operating margin tailwind, but it's not yet clear when to expect that to happen.  Two final points before I turn the call back to Michael. First, please keep in mind that these comments we are making on our planning assumptions are intended to help you understand how we are modeling our business.  As we said earlier, we expect the business environment in the second half of the year to continue to be very difficult to predict for sales demand and for freight and supply chain costs. Our planning assumptions are based on estimates that may not be accurate.  Second, we wanted to reinforce a point we made on last quarter's call. As you update your model for 2022, it'll be very important to back out the impact of one-time sales benefits from external factors such as the Federal stimulus checks in Q1, the pent-up demand we saw in Q2 and the additional benefit from the Child Tax Credits for the balance of 2021. Of course, we will provide more information on our 2022 sales outlook later this year or early next year.  With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Well, thanks, Matt. Good morning. It's a really good question. I think it's worth taking a couple of minutes to explain in some detail what we're seeing. Coming into this year, we and really all other retailers were tentative and somewhat conservative in our sales plans, nobody was really sure what to expect driven by the government stimulus payments, pent-up consumer demand and other one-time factors, sales levels across the retail industry have gone well beyond what anyone would have expected six months ago.  Faced with this surge in demand, all retailers have been competing with each other for capacity along really every link of the global supply chain. The competition for that capacity has driven rates at unprecedented levels.  Just as an example that the spot rate for shipping a container from China to a West Coast port shortly before the pandemic has been running around $1,500 bucks. To do that now, it cost $15,000 and the rates are still increasing.  There aren't enough containers. There aren't enough ships. There aren't enough trucks or trains. There is more volume now than any part of the supply chain pipes can adequately handle. Every piece of the pipe is slower and that our backlogs to work through every step of the way.  To work around these issues most retailers have increase their orders and tried to accelerate them ahead of the fall and holiday season. This has even further increased the pressure on the supply chain, helping to drive even higher rates.  The companies that can afford to, the additional costs are worth incurring temporarily because even after covering these costs, the added operating profit is accretive even if it temporarily hurts operating margins.  Temporarily, maybe the keyword in this situation we believe and most economists seem to agree that this situation will moderate over time as demand subside and as capacity is added. So, like many others, we think the global supply chain issues will likely carry into next year, but at some point the imbalance between demand on the one hand and capacity in the other will start to correct itself.  When this happens, we would expect freight and the rest of the temporary cost related to the disruption and the DC labor shortage to become a tailwind for most companies including us. And remember, while it continues, we do expect the disruption to help us to be able to continue to find plenty of terrific merchandise values for our customers. Thanks Matt. Sure, good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Let me just frame the question a little bit and then I'll answer it. So, EBIT margin expanded 350 basis points in the first quarter and only 110 basis points in the second quarter. So that's about a 250 basis point difference, obviously on a very similar comp level.  So why is that? Well, gross margin was really the key driver of the difference, expanding only 80 basis points in the second quarter versus 230 basis points in the first. So, that's a 150 basis points of the difference.  Markdowns was a big driver of the gross margin difference. And this wasn't unexpected for us. You may remember that during the first quarter call, we said that the markdown improvement in Q1 would not be sustainable. Q1 was kind of unique. We were comparing to the first quarter of 2019 that had quite a bit of clearance activity.  Historically, first quarter had been a weak gross margin quarter for us. We often carried over holiday clearance merchandise from the fall, which dragged our first quarter margin down and this did happen to us in the first quarter of 2019. But in the first quarter of 2021, we started with incredibly fresh and lean inventory.  And then, with the well above planned 20% comp in the first quarter, our inventory turns increased nearly 60%, which we also said would not be sustainable. And it turns out we are right, our inventory turns did slow down in Q2, but they still improved by a very respectable 49%. Aside from gross margin, the remaining 100 basis points difference was largely driven by less SG&A leverage.  Most of that was driven by less advertising leverage in Q2, compared to Q1, and more deleverage from incentive comp in the second quarter. That's okay. Well, first of all, good morning, John. Thanks for your question. I'll start with the first part, this year's is EBIT margin. Back in May, when we spoke, we shared that freight and supply chain costs were rising faster than what we had originally planned for. And while we had planned for these costs to continue to increase, we underestimated the magnitude of the increase.  It looks considerably worse now than it did then. So, today, we shared our Q3 adjusted EBIT margin outlook is down 250 basis points on a ten comp. Our updated full year adjusted EBIT margin plan implies a similar decline for Q4, based on our updated fall comp plan of 10%. Our strong first half margin rate performance is being roughly offset in the back half as we do expect operating margins to be down by over 200 basis points if we perform in line with our 10% comp planning assumption for the fall.  And yes, assuming a 10% comp performance for the fall, we would expect our operating margin rate to be flat. This full year performance is driven by 450 points of deleverage, mostly from freight and supply chain costs and to a lesser degree by the incentive comps cost.  We expect to be able to fully offset these costs with about 450 basis points of combined gross margin expansion, driven by lower markdowns and leverage on SG&A cost. So while the impact of these incremental costs and this year's operating margin is disappointing, there are few other things to keep in mind.  Our updated planning assumptions that we shared today, if realized would deliver 28% total sales growth with the flat operating margin that would mean 28% EBIT dollar growth also. And as we've mentioned a few times today, we think that with the exception of some permanent changes in DC wage rates, the rest of the drivers, the 450 BPS of deleverage are temporary, we estimate the DC wage deleverage impact in these estimates to be less 100 BPS of that 450.  So, for the second part of your question, how do we think about operating margins going forward? Well, we still see fundamentally the same long-term operating margin opportunity that we've been describing. We expect freight supply chain cost to improve. We expect to continue to drive faster inventory turns, which should result in lower markdowns.  We expect to see occupancy leverage increase accelerated by our new smaller stores and we see opportunities to drive better operational efficiency creating other expense leverage. So, yes, we still see the same path to the continued operating margin expansion that that we've been talking about. Thanks, John. We are really excited about the performance of all of our new stores. But particularly, the 16 stores we opened this spring that are 30,000 square feet or smaller. Most of them are about 25,000 feet - 25,000 square feet. Some of them are actually a bit smaller. On average, this group of new stores that we opened this spring are running well ahead of our underwriting targets. And this is - it's also true for the group of smaller stores.  One of the most exciting things about this smaller store format is the potential it has to help us improve leverage and occupancy costs. As I just mentioned, it's a big part of our long-term margin opportunity. But the hypothesis there is always been that we can drive similar sales volumes in smaller, less expensive boxes, that's going to help us drive operating margin expansion.  Still early days, but what we've seen so far with the new batch of smaller stores is really encouraging and it only strengthens our confidence in the potential of the new format. And now that we have several of these stores open, we should have enough of this sample to begin to work through the learning curves of how to best operate in the smaller size.  The economics in the new stores should be a great operating margin tailwind and the availability to boxes in the size range should provide plenty of very attractive sites for future new stores. So, yes, we're really pleased with what we've seen so far this year. Sure, Kimberly. A good question. So I'm going answer the question in two pieces. So, if we were to perform that at 15 comp, obviously, yes, that would give us an opportunity to get some additional leverage on our fixed cost base that component of SG&A and which we're already showing really good leverage.  And it would also help our gross margin performance because we would expect to drive even lower markdowns on a higher sales demand. So that part of \u2013 the way that we would typically think about we our flow through on incremental sales is very much in place. It's even there. If you look at the 10 comp, even though it's a flat margin, you were getting 450 basis points of leverage on a full year performance on our SG&A and on our gross margin.  It's just all been eaten up by the product sourcing cost, supply chain cost and some incentive comp. So, we're very comfortable with that part of our algorithm. But the freight and supply chain costs are very difficult to predict. So, I don't want to give you an exact how it would flow through, because we just don't know. We think we have some pretty conservative assumptions in here realistic.  But, it's just not clear how that situation is going to play out and that's why we've stayed away from giving specific guidance. Okay. Thanks, Kimberly."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are going to structure this morning's discussion as follows: First, I will review our second quarter results; second, I will discuss the outlook for the second half of fiscal 2021; and third, I will share some comments on our ESG initiatives and our most recent corporate social responsibility report. After that, I will hand the call over to John, to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. As a reminder, the results that we discuss today are being compared to the equivalent period in 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic last year, our 2020 results do not provide a good basis for comparability. Okay. So let's talk about our results. Total sales grew 34% in the second quarter, which followed a 35% increase in Q1. Think about that. We grew our sales by over a third versus the first half of 2019. This is compelling evidence that our Burlington 2.0 initiatives are working and that we are taking significant market share as the consumer and the broader economy begin to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now, I will talk about comp store sales. Comparable store sales in the second quarter increased 19%. We believe that there were several factors that drove this very strong comp performance. These factors included, number one, the residual impact of the Federal stimulus payments that were distributed in March.  Number two, pent up demand as the Covid vaccines became more widely available during the quarter and consumer spending picked up. Number three, the beginning of the monthly child tax credit payments in July. And number four, our own very strong execution of our Burlington 2.0 strategies.  Turning to category and regional performance, once again, our strength in the second quarter was a very broad based. All of our major merchandise categories easily outperformed their plans. And comp store sales in all regions of the country were well ahead of our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter increased by 80, that's eight zero basis points. This was despite a 120 basis point increase in freight expense.  Of course, this means that our merchandise margin grew by a very robust 200 basis points. This increase was once again driven by lower markdowns. The buying environment in the second quarter was very favorable and we were able to find great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead of plan sales trend.  At quarter end, our in-store inventory levels were down 7% on a comp store basis. This is a relatively modest decrease compared to recent quarters and it reflects a deliberate strategy. In fact, we chose to accelerate back-to-school receipts to ensure that global supply chain challenges did not impede our ability to take advantage of the sales opportunity that we see for the back-to-school period.  To better understand how we managed our inventories during the second quarter, it is more instructive to look at our average weekly comp store inventories. These were down 25% during the quarter.  For the balance of fiscal 2021, you should expect to see similar double-digit decreases in comp store inventory. As you know, this is a core element of our Burlington 2.0 strategy to run with leaner inventories and to ensure a fresher assortment in front of the customer. Reserve inventory was 31% of our total inventory at the end of the second quarter versus 33% in the 2019 period.  Again, this end of quarter metric does not convey the full story. We have continued to significantly expand our use of reserve inventory as a tool to chase the sales trend. In fact, our reserve receipts during Q2 increased 86%, while our reserve releases increased 64%. In other words, there is a lot more movement in and out of reserve than that was in 2019.  In the second quarter, we were able to make some great opportunistic and strategic buys to put into reserve. But, at the same time, we moved up the release of other goods from reserve to fuel our strong sales trend.  Moving on to new store performance. We are very pleased with the initial rollout of our new smaller store prototype. During the spring season, we opened 16 stores that were 30,000 square feet or less and the earlier results are extremely encouraging. As you know, we expect this smaller format to become our main new store prototype over the next couple of years.  As a point of information, one of these recent openings is in Patchogue, New York. This is very close to those of you who live in the New York City area. So I encourage you to visit, walk the floor, spend some money, and of course, let me know what you think.  In a moment, I will talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, but before I do that, now that the results of the second quarter are in, I would like to briefly review our performance for the year-to-date, in other words, for the spring season, as a whole.  As a retailer, we break the year into two halves, building our plans and strategies for the first half of the year, the spring season, and then separately, building our plans and strategies for the second half of the year, the fall season.  So I think it is helpful and instructive to step back and ask, how well did our strategies work in the spring season, and how well did we execute on these strategies? Also by looking at the season as a whole, this naturally flattens some of the timing issues that can affect or distort one quarter or another.  So, how did we do? Well, for the spring season, Q1 and Q2 combined, our top-line sales growth was 34%. Our comp store sales growth was 20%. Our operating margin grew by 240 basis points and our adjusted earnings per share was ahead by 73%.  Look, we know this was not all us. There were one-time factors such as the Federal stimulus payments and the release of pent-up consumer demand. There is no doubt that these one-time factors helped drive our results. They helped drive every retailer's results. That said, we feel very good about our own performance on an absolute and on a relative basis.  With that said, let me turn to our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2021. Based on our stronger than expected year-to-date results, we have increased our baseline plan for comp store sales for the fall season as a whole from our previous plan of flat to a new plan of plus 10% comp growth.  We are already 3.5 weeks into the quarter, and I am happy to report that our August month-to-date sales trend is currently running well ahead of this. We are chasing the trend and we have growing confidence that we will exceed this 10% hurdle for Q3. As we get further into the quarter, we will update and adjust our baseline plan. But for now, there are significant reasons to remain cautious.  At this point, the surge in COVID cases driven by the delta variant shows no signs of letting up. And it is unclear what impact this may have on consumer spending in the weeks ahead. In this environment, it makes sense to plan our business conservatively and then adjust as we learn more. Throughout this year, we have demonstrated our extraordinary ability to chase the sales trend. We will do the same in the fall season if the sales trend is there.  Moving on from the sales outlook, I would like to spend some time talking about the extraordinary freight and supply chain expense pressures that we are seeing. For several quarters now, there has been a significant imbalance in global transportation systems between demand and available capacity.  This has caused unprecedented volatility and disruption in deliveries of merchandise across all sectors of retail and it has caused a significant spike in international and domestic freight rates. As we move into Q3 and the peak period for retail deliveries, the situation is getting much worse. Again, this is not at all unique to Burlington. These conditions are affecting all retailers.  Based on our experience and success so far this year, we are confident that despite these issues, we will be able to get timely receipt of the merchandise that we need to support our trend. But in doing this, we expect to incur significantly higher freight and supply chain expenses.  As John will detail in a moment, we are anticipating some offsets to these higher expenses. In particular, continued lockdown savings driven by faster inventory turns and leverage on other expenses if we achieve our sales plans. But overall, these higher logistics costs will put significant pressure on our operating margins.  Before I leave this topic, it is important to make the point that the issue I have just described the huge imbalance between demand and available capacity in transportation systems is being driven by short-term factors.  On the one hand, the surge in consumer demand in the United States and on the other hand, the limited capacity of domestic and international transportation systems further hampered by labor shortages and restrictions associated with the pandemic.  We do not believe that this imbalance or these factors are permanent. It will not happen right away, but we expect these issues to normalize over time. As they normalize, we would anticipate that freight rates will come back down. We also believe that if the situation normalizes there could be a significant backlog of merchandise that makes its way into the off-price channel.  Okay. Before I turn the call over to John, there is one other very important topic that I would like to touch on. Earlier this week, we published our Third Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. We are very proud of this report and the accomplishments and progress that it describes.  As a company, we recognize that driving shareholder value is extremely important, but it should not be the only thing that we focus on and it cannot be the only objective that we measure ourselves against. We have a much broader set of responsibilities, to our associates, to our customers and to the communities that we serve. These are all critically important stakeholders.  We believe that by serving these stakeholders, we will build a stronger, better, and more sustainable company. And that in doing this, we will further enhance and drive shareholder value over the longer term. The CSR report that we published earlier this week is intended to back up these words with specific details on the programs that we are pursuing and data on the progress that we are making.  It covers important topics like inclusion and diversity, community outreach and support, and environmental sustainability. To be clear, while we are proud of our commitment and our accomplishments, we regard this as a journey and we know that we have plenty of work still to do.  I would encourage you all to take a look at the report, which is available on our Investor Relations website and I invite you to follow-up with us if you have questions or would like more information.  Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance. John? Thank you, John. Let me wrap up my remarks by congratulating the entire Burlington family for our exceptional performance in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2021. As I've said before, this is a really exciting time to be at the company. We have very strong momentum. We are building and strengthening our team and we are achieving results that are at the top of our retail peer group.  Our 34% total sales growth year-to-date reinforces our confidence and our ability to take significant market share over time. Meanwhile, despite the temporary expense headwinds that we are placing, we remain very excited about our ability to significantly expand operating margins over the next few years.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator? Sure. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. As you'll probably recall, in the - for the first quarter, we estimate that the impact of the Federal stimulus checks as being worth 10 to 15 points of comp growth. That analysis was fairly straightforward. The checks were sent out over a very short time period in March of this year and we could see the sales lift in the days and the weeks that followed. So the analysis wasn't hard and we're fairly confident about that estimate.  For Q2 As I said in the script, there were several factors that drove \u2013 what we think drove our comp growth including probably a residual impact from those stimulus checks, plus pent-up demand as life started to get back to normal in Q2. And then the Child Tax Credit payments that were made later in the quarter.  We certainly tried to quantify the impact of each of those, but it was much more difficult. For example, how do you quantify pent-up demand. So, we don't really have an estimate that we can share for Q2. But nevertheless, I would say, we are fairly sure that the impact of those items was pretty significant. The reason that that's important is that, is that all of those items are non-recurring.  This year, these factors have been like a rising tide. They've lifted all retailers. In 2022, we would expect that that tide is going to recede. And so, as John said earlier, as you think about sales models for 2022, it will be very important to back out the significant impact of those one-time items, not just for us but for every retailer. Thanks Matt. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Great to hear from you. I would say that we are very skeptical about the ability of retailers to sustainably raise prices across the categories that we can compete in. There are really two reasons for that skepticism. Firstly, it's important to grow a distinction between higher realized prices in the short-term versus permanently higher prices longer term.  It's clear the inventory levels across the retail industry have been very lean this year and as a consequence, there has been very little promotional activity. That means, that realized prices have been higher for many retailers. But we just don't think that's sustainable.  The realized prices are higher up because inventories are lean but the only reason that inventories are lean is that there has been a huge surge in consumer demand at the same time as supply chains have been constrained. So, we think that when the situation normalizes, it's likely realized prices will come back down to more like historical levels.  That's the first reason we're skeptical. The second the second factor that maybe feeding into this is that the - is a spike in freight and supply chain costs. If you believe that those costs are permanent and I think you could make a good case that retailers may try to pass those costs on in the form of higher prices, but as we said in the remarks and as John just described, we think those costs are mostly about a moment in time, a short-term imbalance between demand and capacity.  It is just picking up on one of the data points that John shared earlier, ocean freight rates are about ten times higher now than they were in 2019. That is not because operating a ship or paying a dock yard worker is ten times higher. It's because demand exceeds capacity. That imbalance won't last. It will normalize. So, we think any price increase that's based on those short-term costs, again it's just not likely to be sustainable.  So that's our assessment. Now, let me wrap up my answer by saying, we could be wrong. Maybe prices across retail really will move up in the next year or two and to be clear, we wouldn't mind at all for an off-price retailer like us that would be terrific. It would help to further expand our value differentiation. Through the lens of Burlington 2.0, we would see this as a great opportunity to drive sales, not to drive margin, but to drive sales. Thanks, Lorraine Well, good morning, Ike. Yes. Thank you. It's a very good question. Having just done a 20% comp for the spring of 2021, it is pretty challenging to think about well, how should we plan spring of 2022. We are getting to a point where we are starting to work on that, because typically, as we move into October November, we start working on our plans for the following spring.  I don't have a lot of details to share. But let me do this. Let me offer up a possible scenario to 2022 in terms of what the year could look like. We think that it's possible that 2022 will be a very difficult and turbulent year across the retail industry and I'm not saying that with any sense of doom or pessimism on the contrary difficult turbulent years in retail are often very good for off-price.  So as I sort of lay out why we think the year could be difficult and you should interpret this as me feeling upbeat and not the opposite. So, really two reasons why I am saying I think 2022 could be a difficult year in retail. But the first reason we kind of touched on earlier, in 2021, every retailer has benefited from significant one-time items that have driven much higher sales levels than they otherwise would have achieved.  When retailers anniversary those items in 2022, comps could welfare negative that mathematically that seems very lightly. Secondly, in 2021, that surge in sales was accompanied by global supply chain constraints and very lean inventory levels, which means that many retailers have seen just a remarkable recovery in margins.  Again, if you scroll forward to 2022, if consumer demand does falloff and it's likely that those supply chain constraints are going to ease. So you could see an increase in the flow of merchandise into the country. At the very time the comp sales trends have turned negative. Now the scenario I've just described, a negative sales trend across retail and a loose out supply of merchandise could create huge disruption.  But the consequences for off-price and for Burlington 2.0 in particular, we think it'd be very favorable. It could offer the potential to further accelerate our ability to take share. Now, I don't want over tell the scenario I've just described for the past eighteen months have demonstrated that there are serious hazards to anyone making predictions.  So, but that's actually - that's kind of the point. For 2022 given the uncertainty, we think that we're going to need to be very flexible and very nimble. So we can respond to any scenario we face including the scenario I just described and if there is an opportunity, so that we can - we're in position to take advantage of it. Yes. So, it's a really good question. In fact, for the last several months, I've been working with the executive team on exactly this question. Can we move faster? Again, I don't have a detailed answer, but let me offer up a few comments.  Number one, we're mindful that we're building a company for the long-term here where everything we do needs to be done in a very high quality way. So we are not going to accelerate anything if we have to compromise how well we do it. That's point number one.  Point number two, I would say that there are there are areas where if the opportunity presents itself, then we will absolutely move faster. The best example of this is the investment we're making in our merchandising organization. If we see strong talents in the market or strong flow talent in the market, we'll move on it very quickly. We won't be held back by existing hiring plans or budgets.  And then, I guess, the third point is that there are or there may be some other initiatives that we can accelerate. But we need to do more homework first before we make a decision to formally adjust our plans. The key thing, I guess, bringing it back to this year, the key thing is that, for the balance of 2021, we need to focus heavily on doing what we've been doing, offering great value, planning the business conservatively and being ready to change.  So, we'll certainly in parallel, sort of work on some of those longer term opportunities and possibly accelerating some of those longer term opportunities. But then our main focus for the next six months needs to be to keep doing what we are doing. It's been a winning game for us, so far of this year. Thank you. Sure. So, good morning, Kimberly. It's Michael. I'll take that question. It's a good question. And I can see ordinarily after such a strong start to the quarter, we would have taken up the plan for the quarter by now. But in this particular situation, we're being a little cautious, I think for two reasons. The first I kind of mentioned in the remarks that the surge in COVID cases related to the Delta variant.  Now so far, there is absolutely no evidence that that had any impact on our business. But if the situation deteriorates, then obviously that could change. So that's one reason to be in a little bit cautious. The second reason we're being a little bit cautious is the third quarter, much more so than any other quarter of the year weather that really matters.  Given I know we've talked about this before, given our legacy of as Burlington Coat Factory, I would say that the good or bad, weather affects us in the third quarter most - more than it does most other retailers. When weather turns cooler, shoppers naturally think of outerwear.  And so, if the weather turns cooler, earlier in the quarter, and that really helps us versus other retailers, if on the other hand, it remains warm until later in the quarter, then that can hurt us. Right now, most of the long range forecasts, weather forecasts are saying that October and even November could be unusually warm.  We never really know how much face to place in those forecasts. So that they could be wrong, but it makes sense for us given that outlook to be cautious in Q3. If the forecasts are wrong, we know that we can chase and actually, in our reserve inventory, we have a pretty good outerwear position. So, if the weather did turn cool out sooner, then we would chase the trend. Sure. So, good morning, Michael. Yes, everything you said is correct in terms of the comparisons of the quarters. So, we saw a nice merch margin improvement in Q2, but it wasn't as big as the improvement in Q1. That's really driven by the point that John was making earlier that Q1 was with the anomaly. Q1 we were much cleaner coming into Q1 than we've been historically. And as a result, we took off fewer markdowns in Q1. So that was really - that was really what drove that difference between Q1 and Q2.  Looking forward to the back half, obviously, our back half baseline comp assumption is a 10% percent comp. If we do a 20% comp in the back half of the year, I would be hoping or I would be expecting much stronger inventory turns, much stronger markdowns and as it drives a stronger, merch margin performance than we've indicated.  Just linking this though to the point you're making about availability of merchandise, I would say that so far this year, availability has been pretty good - pretty good. We've had no problem - across our business, we had no problem overall chasing our receipts here. We've gone from a - we started the year with a flat comp as a plan and we've obviously at 20. So we've been quite nimble to find the goods.  As I think about the backlog in supply chains, I think the availability is going to get better, much better even than the pretty good availability we've seen. But I think that improvement in availability may not happen for a few months. We are going to get into a point here probably in October, something like that when goods that have been ordered that haven't arrived in the United States aren't going to make it for holiday.  And I think at that point, it could be a good - a good buying opportunity for off-price. But, we'll see. And a lot of that merchandise we would end up putting in reserve anyway. But, we do think there is going to be some opportunities in the months ahead. Yes. It's a good question. We are kind of assuming that that reserve inventory over the next month or two is going to kind of come in at a similar rate to what we've been experiencing. But we do think that there is a buying opportunity down the road, probably though for merchandise that we wouldn't necessarily flow to stores.  So it wouldn't necessarily hit the 10 comp. Some of it might, but most of it might be packed away for the next year, because it would be seasonal merchandise. Thanks, Michael. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in November to discuss our third quarter results. Thanks again."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're going to structure this morning's discussion as follows. First, I will review our first quarter results; second, I will discuss the outlook for the second quarter; and third, I will provide a high level update on the investments that we are making in our merchandizing organization. As you will recall, this is one of the most important initiatives in our Burlington 2.0 full potential strategy. After that, I will hand the call over to John, to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic last year, our 2020 results do not provide a good basis for comparability. Okay. So, let's talk about our results. In these quarterly earnings calls, we normally focus on comparable store sales growth. In a moment, I will discuss comp sales, but I would like to start my remarks today by highlighting our total sales growth in the first quarter. This includes new stores opened since 2019, as well as comp stores. Of course, total sales, is what really matters when looking at what is happening with market share. In the first quarter of 2021, our total sales grew by 35% versus the first quarter of 2019. We see this as early and direct evidence of our ability to take significant market share of the economy and the consumer emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, I will talk about comp store sales. Comparable store sales in the first quarter increased 20% versus the same period in fiscal 2019. For the quarter to date, through mid-March comp store sales were up mid-single-digits. From then on, they really took off for the balance of Q1, our comp trend averaged over 30% with the biggest surge coming in late March, and then moderating as we moved through April. We believe that there were a number of factors that drove this strong comp performance. These include the latest round of stimulus checks, the pace of the vaccine rollout, pent-up consumer demand, and our own very strong execution. In terms of category and regional performance, our strength in the first quarter was broad based. All our major merchandise categories outperformed their plans, and comp store sales in all regions of the country were well ahead of our expectations. Our gross margin in Q1 increased 230 basis points. This was despite a 110 basis point increase in freight expense. I was especially pleased with the 340 basis point increase in our merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower markdowns. Our receipts are fresher, we are turning faster, and we are capturing the margin benefits of these faster turns. The buying environment in the first quarter was very favorable and we were able to find great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales trend. At quarter end, our in-store inventory levels were down 19% on a comp store basis. This was deliberate and consistent with our stated strategy of running our business with much leaner in-store inventory levels. In fact, our in-store inventory turns increased 59% on a comparable basis for Q1. Looking ahead, we are planning average comp store inventories to be down significantly throughout the year. But this does not mean they will necessarily be down at the end of every month and every quarter. We are more flexible, nimble, and opportunistic than ever before. This means that we will manage our receipt flow and our score inventories so we can capitalize on the sales opportunities as we see them. Reserve inventory increased to 35% of our total inventory at the end of the first quarter, versus 34% in the 2019 period. This modest increase disguises the fact that we made very heavy use of reserves during the quarter to chase the sales trend. Our reserve receipts during Q1 actually increased 45% versus the same period in 2019. In other words, we were able to make some great opportunistic and strategic buys to pack away in reserve, but at the same time, we moved up the release of other goods from reserves to fuel our trend. These were items that we had planned to release later in the spring that we float early to replenish our stores in April. Our merchants have gotten very skilled at using reserve this way. Now that I have reviewed the main elements of our Q1 results, I would like to take a moment to step back and provide some editorial commentary. The sales opportunity in Q1 was clearly attributable to external factors, especially the latest round of stimulus checks, but it is important to recognize that even when you get a slow pitch down the middle of the plate, you still have to make good contact. Even when the sales environment is favorable, you still have to chase it. That is what happened. We really connected with the ball in Q1, and we maximized our share of this sales opportunity. Our success in doing this was driven by strong execution of our core Burlington 2.0 initiatives. We recognize that our customers had a lot of choices in the first quarter as to where they could spend their stimulus dollars. We operate in an extremely competitive industry. We know that we have to earn our customers business by offering the best merchandise value across the assortment every day. Burlington 2.0 is enabling us to do this. I was very pleased with how well we executed in Q1 in all areas of the company: buying, planning, supply chain, stores, marketing, and all areas of the company combined together to deliver our strong Q1 results. Now, I would like to talk about the outlook for Q2. Based on our results for the first quarter, we have raised our internal baseline comp sales plan to positive 10% for Q2. At this point, we have not adjusted our baseline comp sales plans for Q3 and Q4. We have held those plans flat for now. I anticipate that we will make adjustments to Q3 and Q4 once we have greater visibility. As we have said before, it is important to understand that this baseline comp sales plan is just a planning tool. In this environment, the sales trend is extremely difficult to predict. By now, most of you know our playbook pretty well. We intend to manage our business flexibly if our comp trend during the second quarter exceeds 10%, then as we demonstrated in Q1 we have the ability to chase the stronger sales trend. And conversely of course, we can pull back if that turns out to be necessary. The other aspect of the outlook that I would like to call out is that we continue to face significant challenges driven by industry-wide supply chain issues. These issues are causing huge volatility and delays in receipt flow, and they are also driving significantly higher freight and supply chain expenses. In the first quarter, we were able to stay on top of these challenges. Our planning, distribution, and logistics teams did an outstanding job anticipating and working around these issues. This meant that despite the challenges, we were able to get fresh receipts to our stores in a timely fashion to fuel a strong sales trend. Meanwhile, our merchant margin performance and the expense leverage on ahead of plan sales in Q1 helped offset significant freight and supply chain expense headwinds. But, as you have heard from other retailers, these issues have not gone away. In fact, over the last few months, they have deteriorated. As John will describe in his remarks, we now believe that these issues will be with us for at least the balance of the year, and they will put some pressure on our margin recovery. I would like to move on now to provide an update on one of the core priorities within our Burlington 2.0 strategy, investment in our merchandising capabilities. We had ambitious growth plans for our merchandising organization coming into the year. And I am pleased to report that we're running ahead of these plans, both in terms of new hires, and promotions. One important milestone to share is that we recently signed a lease to double the square footage of our New York City buying office. I should also note that last year, we relocated our West Coast buying office to substantially bigger space. We are excited about our plans to grow out on the ground presence in New York and Los Angeles over the next few years. I'm also happy to report that we have a robust pipeline of candidates. There are three factors that are driving our ability to attract great merchandising talent. Firstly, candidates can see that we have a unique opportunity to grow our business over the next several years. Secondly, Burlington 2.0 is creating a huge amount of buzz, excitement, and energy around the strategic direction of the company. And thirdly, candidates are attracted to our culture. We do not often talk about this third point, but it is very important.  So, let me spend a few moments on it. I believe that the bedrock for any lasting and successful strategy is a strong culture, an inclusive and diverse workplace, where people are valued and respected, and where they are supported and encouraged to achieve their own full potential. We recognize that nurturing this culture is a journey, not a destination. That said, I believe that our culture is a major competitive advantage for us. In fact, we were recently voted to Fortunes 100 Best Companies to Work For. We were one of only seven retailers to be recognized on this list for 2021. We are proud of this award. It is a tribute to our associates, and to our managers and leaders throughout the company. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. John?\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the income statement. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, total sales grew 35%, while comparable store sales increased by 20%. The gross margin rate in the first quarter was 43.3%, an increase of 230 basis points versus 2019\u2019s first quarter rate of 41.0%. This improvement was driven by a 340 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns. This merchandise margin increase more than offset a significant increase in freight expense, which was 110 basis points higher than 2019\u2019s first quarter rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were 141 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus 79 million in the first quarter of 2019, increasing 160 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs accounted for 140 basis points of this de-leverage. These expense pressures were consistent with what we had seen in Q4, with similar underlying drivers, higher wage rates and wage incentives, inefficiencies caused by safety protocols, and the disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain. The balance of de-leverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs. This is consistent with Burlington 2.0 and our strategy of investing in our merchandising capabilities. Adjusted SG&A was 518 million, versus 428 million in 2019, decreasing 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. SG&A leverage was primarily due to leverage in store related costs and marketing expense, as well as overall leverage and fixed costs achieved on a 20% comp. Adjusted EBIT margin increased by 360 basis points to 10.9% versus 7.2% in the first quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share with $2.51 versus $1.15 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.59 versus $1.26 in the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 23 net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 784 stores. This included 26 new store openings, one relocation, and two closures. We ended the period, with available liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion including approximately 1.5 billion in unrestricted cash and 549 million of availability on our ABL. Our total balance sheet debt is now 2.1 billion, which includes 959 million on our term loan, 805 million in convertible notes, 300 million in high-yield senior secured notes, and no outstanding balance on our ABL. Given the improving visibility on the sales, earnings, and cash flow trajectory of our business, we are beginning to get more comfortable utilizing excess cash on our balance sheet to reduce our gross leverage. Accordingly, concurrent with our earnings release this morning, we announced that we initiated the process to execute a make-whole call that will fully redeem the $300 million of outstanding of our 6.25% high-yield senior secured notes. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we think that now is a good time to begin to reduce our leverage. Despite the recent strength of our business, the outlook remains very unpredictable. So, we are not providing specific sales or earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021, but as we did on our last earnings call, we would like to share some high level comments on how we are thinking about our possible financial performance for the full-year 2021. As Michael mentioned earlier, we will continue to plan sales cautiously and adjusted the trends that we see just as we did in the first quarter. Our current baseline comp sales plan for the second quarter is 10%. For the back half of the year, we are currently assuming a flattish comp, but we'll update these plans as visibility improves. This translates to a full-year comp baseline planning assumption of approximately 7%. As you think about total sales growth for the balance of FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should remember to factor in two years of new stores over this time period. We opened 23 net new stores in Q1. Expect to open 9 net new stores in Q2, and 43 net new stores in the second half of 2021. The growth in new store and non-comp sales, combined with our comp baseline assumption of 7% will deliver approximately 20% total sales growth for the full fiscal year. One final point to make on sales. If you look further out and begin to model 2022, it will be important to back out the impact of one-time macro factors, such as the federal stimulus checks that contributed to our extraordinary sales performance in Q1. Of course, we will provide more information on our 2022 sales outlook much later this year or early next year. On our last earnings call we explained that our modeling would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 basis points to 80 basis points if comp sales were flat in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. Obviously, our stronger sales trend year to date should help this margin performance, but it's also important to call out that we now expect more severe expense pressure from freight and supply chain costs. These increased freight and supply chain expenses will drive more de-leverage than we had previously estimated. As a result, given our updated full-year comp baseline assumption of 7%, our modeling now suggests a full-year operating margin decline of 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Finally, we expect operating margin in the second quarter to be under more pressure than later in the year, as a result of increased freight and supply chain cost and the timing of some expenses. Specifically, we expect the operating margin to be down 70 basis points to 80 basis points in the second quarter due to the aforementioned factors. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan : Thank you, John. Let me wrap up my remarks by reiterating the point that I made earlier. The sales opportunity in Q1 was attributable to external factors, especially the federal stimulus checks. But our success in maximizing our share of this opportunity was driven by our own strong execution of our Burlington 2.0 strategy. This execution was clear across buying, planning, supply chain stores, marketing, and all areas of the company. So, let me finish by [thanking everyone] at Burlington for such a strong all around team performance. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great thanks, and congrats on the material momentum. So, first for Michael. So, if we think about the second quarter here straight with relative comp performance well ahead of peers, is it fair to take this as a sign that Burlington 2.0 is working? And if so, should we expect this level of relative outperformance to continue as we look forward?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Matt. Nice to hear from you. Thank you for asking that question. You know, I\u2019m going to focus my answer on our performance rather than relative performance. Of course, we care about how we compare versus other retailers. Of course, we do, but we don't know what is going on in other companies. And of course, we have no control over what they do. The only thing that we control is our own performance. So with that said, let me talk about Burlington 2.0. As you know, we started telling the story of Burlington 2.0 back in February or March of 2020, which obviously was great timing, but despite the pandemic, we were able to push forward with the strategy throughout last year. You know, it's gratifying that in the last couple of quarters, we've started to see some of the early benefits. You know, it feels like we've been telling the story. And now it's really nice to be delivering some strong results to go along with it. As a reminder, the core premise of Burlington 2.0 is that we can be more off price, more flexible, and more responsive to the trend. And that by doing this, that we'll be able to drive significantly improved sales and profitability. Maybe what I should do is just take a few minutes to peel the onion a little bit and describe what that flexibility and responsiveness looked like across the company in Q1. I'll start with the merchandising team. In the first quarter, under Jennifer Vecchio\u2019s leadership, our merchants massively shifted the assortment from where it had been in 2019. Remember, that's what we're comparing ourselves against 2019. They did that based upon what the customer has been telling us and they chased into the hottest categories and trends. We controlled our liquidity extremely carefully. So, when the time came, we were able to support and fund our buyers as they went into the market and took advantage of some great opportunistic buys and some wow deals. Great value is what drives sales in off price and great value is certainly what drove our business in Q1. Moving on to planning, with all the uncertainty and volatility of the past year, our planners have become very agile and flexible, forecasting, and re-forecasting the business, and taking up and moving around open to buy dollars based upon trend and availability. Our planning team played a critical role as we chased from a baseline plan of a flat comp in Q1 to a actualized comp store sales growth of 20%., obviously that's a serious chase. Next, supply chain and logistics, you know, some of the biggest challenges we faced in Q1 were in supply chain and logistics. Global and domestic transportation networks were and continue to be a mess. Despite those issues, we processed more receipts in the month of March than we did in the comparable timeframe leading up to holiday last year. And normally, for holiday, we spend months preparing for peak receipt flow, but in an incredibly compressed timeframe, our supply chain and logistics teams, again demonstrated remarkable agility, and they were able to overcome the challenges that we faced. And then finally stores, we experienced huge sales volume to our stores in March. Again, comparable to the equivalent time period leading up to holiday, but unlike holiday, we didn't have time to go out and recruit seasonal staff. Our fields and store teams had to react very quickly with what they had. They did an amazing job flexing up to support the huge increase in sales. Hopefully, what comes across and what I've said is that we were very flexible, nimble, even entrepreneurial in Q1. We saw the sales opportunity and we went for it. I think it was a really, really good early demonstration of Burlington 2.0. Let me let me finish up just on second part of your question. Should you expect this kind of relative performance going forward? I guess, I could answer that by saying that we're enjoying this, we're pleased that we've had a couple of good quarters, but we know that it is just two quarters. We operate in an extremely competitive space. I would expect that the relative performance gap versus our peers that we've seen in the last couple of quarters is going to disappear or perhaps at least narrow in the coming months. I'd be very surprised if it didn\u2019t.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe as a follow up for John, in the prepared remarks you mentioned a worsening in industry-wide supply chain and freight issues, do you now regard these higher expenses as permanent or should we think of them as transitory? And how do you think they might affect your long-term margin potential?\nJohn Crimmins: Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for your question. Obviously, a complicated situation. Earlier this year, we thought or maybe we hoped that some of the industry-wide supply chain issues would have started to settle down by now, but that clearly hasn't happened. In fact, the whole global supply chain situation seems to have gotten maybe even a little bit worse. There are really three key areas where the situation impacts us the most. I'll start with ocean freight as the first one. You've heard from everyone, there are significant capacity issues and delays with imports, especially shipments going through \u2013 coming into the West Coast ports. The demand for ocean freight is far exceeding the supply right now, and it's significantly driven up freight rates. At Burlington, we don't directly import a lot of merchandise ourselves, but the problem is that a lot of what we sell is imported, not by us, but by our vendors. So, the higher rates do affect us both the small part of our business where we import the product that we sell in the product that's imported by our vendors. These higher ocean freight costs end up hurting our merch margin. Second part where we have exposure is on domestic freights. It continues to be significant congestion in domestic freight networks, all modes of transportation. This congestion is affecting both the speed that we're able to move merchandise along with the cost. And the third area where we're impacted is in supply chain, particularly supply chain wages. In the areas of our country where our distribution facilities are located, we've seen some significant labor shortages. We've talked about this previously. Starting late last summer, we began to aggressively raise wages and wage incentives to track and to retain the workers that we need. That's worked for us. It's provided the stability that we need, but these pressures haven't totally gone away. And the volatility and receipt flow has added to these pressures by driving lower efficiency in our distribution centers. We're not able to plan when receipts are going to come in reliably, so we have to make a lot of adjustments and that has a negative impact on our ability to be efficient. And remember, throughout this year, we're comparing to 2019, so we have two years of wage inflation and we don't have the benefit of comparing to the increases in wages that we made in the fall of 2020. And to the second part of your question, are these costs permanent or transitory? Typically, external freight rates, whether it's ocean freight, road, or rail, it\u2019s tended to be driven by supply and demand. We don't really see a structural change here. We think that the issues we've been talking about are cyclical, and that over time, they will correct themselves. It does seem to be very much driven by an out of balance, supply and demand equation, exacerbated and extended by the huge pent up demand we're seeing with so many consumer products. So, we do think that the situation will get better. We just don't see that happening in 2021. On the supply chain expenses, we do believe that some portion of these costs, specifically the higher wage rates will be permanent, as we talked about on our Q4 call. That said, we do have a pretty good track record of finding offsets to these types of costs, through process changes, automation, or other productivity improvements. We already have a number of initiatives underway and we would expect to be able to at least partially offset these higher wage costs over time, but it will take a little time. And the final part of your question, now, we don't see anything in the current environment that causes us to doubt our ability to significantly increase our operating margin over the longer-term. In our business, there are always headwinds and pressures, but we don't see anything that might materially impact our ability to achieve our longer-term, margin potential.\nMatthew Boss: That's great color. Congrats on the performance, guys.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, two questions. One for Michael and follow-up for John. So, Michael, in your comments, you mentioned some of the external drivers of the Q1 comp performance, can you just give some more color on these? In particular, I'm curious about how much you think the stimulus checks may have helped or been worth to the trend? And then lastly, can you give any insight on the month to date trend in May, perhaps?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Good morning, Ike. On the first part of your question, the drivers of our comp growth in Q1, maybe the \u2013 I think the best place to start is probably by going back to mid-March. At that point, our quarter to date comp was running up mid-single-digit. From that point on, the trend really accelerated. Our average comp growth for the remainder of the quarter, as I mentioned in my remarks was in excess of 30%. The biggest spike, as you'd expect, came in late March. And then the trend started to cool off in April. It held up pretty well. But obviously it cooled off after that spike in late March.  Now, we think there were a few factors that drove that sales trend. Most significant by far were the federal stimulus checks. During March, the government published data every day, showing the value of checks that were sent out in the previous day. So, it was not difficult for any retailer to correlate that data with their own sales trend. You know, our own modeling suggests that those checks were worth 10 percentage points to 15 percentage points of comp store sales growth in Q1. Now, of course, our overall comp growth actualized at 20%. So, we think the remaining 5 points to 10 points of comp is explainable from two other factors, two other sets of factors. Firstly, obviously, the pace of the vaccine rollout accelerated during the quarter, and somewhat related to that, we think that there was some pent up demand that helped drive the trend, as consumers saw a path whereby their lives might start to return to normal. It's hard to quantify the impact of those factors, but we believe that they helped sustain our comp trend through April and even into May. And I'm going to talk about the main month to date trend in a moment. The other important factor with our own performance, I think that we have to give ourselves some credit here or our comp growth in Q1, our strong execution in the quarter really helped to maximize our share of the sales opportunity. That's a good segue, I think, to the second part of your question about the month to date trends in May. As a reminder, our baseline comp plan for Q2 is 10%. And at this point, obviously, we're 3.5 weeks into May. Our comp sales trend is running ahead of this baseline. So that gives us confidence in our Q2 baseline of 10%. So, let me finish up as I usually do by saying that we are ready to taste the sales trends, whatever it turns out to be or to pull back, depending upon how things play out, just as we get in Q1.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Quick follow up for John, if I may? Just a number of other retailers and off-prices have talked about the COVID related costs as a big source of margin leverage and strong sales; I don't think I heard you even mentioned these. I'm just kind of wondering how those have affected your margins. Are you seeing much less of an effect than others as why or why not would that be, just any color would be great there?\nJohn Crimmins: Yeah, Ike, thanks. Good question and good morning, by the way. Yeah, so I can't really speak to other retailers, but happy to add a little more color around how we think about our COVID costs. So, let's look backwards first, as you know, when we talked about the third and fourth quarter last year, we shared that we had COVID costs of $20 million in Q3, and $39 million in Q4. In the $39 million in Q4 included the significant full-year of thank you bonus for our non-exempt associates. So, I think what causes some confusion comparing to others is, we've got a kind of narrow definition, I think, for our COVID costs. We've included only what we see as the direct costs. So that means we include what we spend on personal protective equipment, on cleaning supplies, and incremental cleaning, and we include the cost of our front door ambassadors. Of course, there are many other costs that have been indirectly impacted by the pandemic. But we don't include them in this bucket that we use to collect what we're calling COVID costs.  Back at the end of the fourth quarter, we said, we were expecting quarterly COVID costs to be similar to the $20 million we had in Q3 for at least the first couple of quarters of 2021 or until the pandemic was going to be behind us. We're still continuing with the same level of safety and cleaning protocols that we had in place for 2020, but our COVID costs for Q1 were only about $14 million. So, let me explain that. We significantly overbought PPE, and cleaning supplies during 2020. So we were able to spend much less on replenishing those supplies during the first quarter. We're still prioritizing the safety and comfort of our customers and associates and are continuing with all of our safety protocols. And we'll keep doing that until it's clear that they're no longer needed.\nIke Boruchow: Super helpful. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, John, and thanks, David.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Ike.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Hutchinson. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John, you just delivered significant operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Can you give us a little more color as to why you'd expect operating margins to still deliver 20 basis points to 30 basis points if you're doing a 7 comp for the year, and then also maybe help us understand the extra pressure in the second quarter operating margin that you called out?\nJohn Crimmins: Yeah, good morning Lorraine. Thanks. Good question or questions there. First, let me start off by just saying that, you know, obviously, we're really pleased with our operating margin performance in the first quarter, but it was just so outstanding that we \u2013 and we have a bunch of unique factors that we wouldn't expect that kind of sales performance for the second quarter or the balance of the year. You know, it was the 20% comp and the 35% sales growth that drove the [360 basis point] operating margin improvement. About two-thirds of the improvement was from gross margin and the other third from expense leverage. And all this was despite 110 basis point headwind in freight and 160 basis point headwind in product sourcing costs, but again, both the gross margin expansion and the SG&A leverage, it was really driven by the exceptional comp sales performance. So, as we've said earlier in my remarks, we're not planning for sales performance to be anything like we saw in the first quarter. We're planning for approximately 10%, up in Q2 comp sales and flattish for Q3 and Q4. These comp baseline planning assumptions would deliver a four year comp performance of about 7% when you factor them in with our Q1 sales. So, back in March, we've said that we would expect to see operating margin expansion began at about a six comp or slightly higher comp for this year. Our new outlook of 20 bips to 30 bips of de-leverage at the 7% comp includes the benefits of the strong flow through we saw in the first quarter. But it's more than offset by the increases we now expect in trade and supply chain costs for the balance of the year. And by some extents timing, that will affect us in the last three quarters of the year. So, as for the pressure on the second quarter, along with the incremental cost for freight and supply chain, the second quarters margin is going to be affected by some expense timing. So, let me try to explain what I mean by that. First, as we said in our remarks, we use reserve inventory to chase the high sales demand we saw during Q1. So that means during the second quarter, we're going to work to increase our incoming receipts to replenish our reserves to planned levels. And that's going to cause incremental expense in the second quarter. Then take some of the timing issues. So, we have an accounting policy that capitalizes freight as it's incurred, and then expenses it later when the inventory is ultimately sold. So what that means is, some of the increased costs we saw in Q1 will help hit our P&L a little later in the year, including in the second quarter. And then we also have some annual expenses that are accrued on a straight line basis for the full-year. So, this would include incentive comp accruals, which of course have been increased based on our new estimates of performance for the full-year. The straight line annual expenses are going to have a negative impact on flow through in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So, combining all these factors along with the second quarter being typically our small sales quarter for the year, that's how we got to our expectation of a 70 basis point to 80 basis point operating margin decline in the second quarter.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. And then if I could just ask a follow up question on a different topic. How does the redemption of the high yield notes fit into your forward looking views on the capital structure? And then any thoughts on when we should expect the share repurchase to resume?\nDavid Glick: Hi, Lorraine, this is David, I'll be happy to take that question. First, I'd say that, you know, our overarching philosophy is to maintain, you know, a conservative and flexible balance sheet. You know, we feel really good about the ongoing recovery and our sales and EBITDA, you know, at the end of the first quarter Lorraine we had over 1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So, now we believe that, you know the combination of our business momentum and strong liquidity positions us well to start to address some of our highest cost debt that we issued last April. And just as a reminder, you know, we've stated in prior quarters that coming out of the pandemic our priority for excess cash is to reduce our gross leverage. And to address your question around share repurchases, you know, look we've analyzed all of our potential uses of our excess cash. And, you know, keeping in mind that conservative balance sheet philosophy, we just think it makes sense to redeem our high yield notes first, which we announced this morning. And then we reassess the operating environment before we take more cash off our balance sheet to either pay down more debt or return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases.  So, you know really the first step is to reduce our gross debt before we consider when to reserve share repurchases. We'd really like to see really a more sustained, positive trend and our sales and EBITDA growth before we go beyond redeeming the high-yield notes.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Lorraine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning Michael, John, and David. I also have two questions both are on Burlington 2.0. First is for Michael and then a follow-up for John. Michael you now have two quarters in a row of comps and margins well above expectations. If you take a step back, would you say that you're further along with Burlington 2.0 than you initially expect it to be at this point? And are there any details on your major Burlington 2.0 initiatives? What are the big things that are still left on the table?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning, John. Thank you for the question. I think the easiest way to answer that question is probably to separate out our Burlington 2.0 priorities and initiatives into a couple of major buckets. Firstly, there are things that we're doing, changes that we're making, and we have been making that are already affecting the business and already driving performance. So, I'll talk about those in a moment. And then secondly, there are other things that we're doing and investments that we're making that by design will take time to really, really impact the business. So, first bucket includes a number of very important changes and priorities, including a much greater focus on value, more conservative planning to set up a stronger chase, tighter control of liquidity, lower inventory levels, tighter control of expenses, more flexible operating processes. And these are all things that we started doing last year. And I think they've really helped to drive that performance over the last couple of quarters. Now to answer your question, are we further along on these areas than I would have anticipated a year ago? I would say, yes, absolutely. We're much further along. It's been very impressive to see how our merchants and our operators have embraced Burlington 2.0 over the past year. Now, that's not to say that we can't get better in all of those areas, we know that we can. There are other changes and improvements that we're planning to make across the business that should make the chase more effective across buying, planning, supply chain, and stores. So that's the first bucket. The second bucket includes changes, priorities, investments, that we're moving [full steam] ahead with, but that will take time to really impact the business. I stress that in many ways, these items will be much more important in terms of their longer-term benefits to the company. Just to dwell on two of those for a moment. Of course, the one big one, which I mentioned earlier, the investment that we're making, in our merchandising capabilities, this is going to \u2013 that's going to be critical to our ability to offer great value to customers. And that's really the key to driving our sales over the longer-term. Now, as I said in my remarks, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in strengthening our merchandising organization. The other longer term item to call out is the work that we've been doing on our new store prototype and our new store opening program. We talked a little bit about those on the March call. Again, I feel like we've made a lot of progress, but realistically, the big significant savings from this new store program are going to express themselves in 3, 4, 5 years time. I'm very confident that that program is going to [drive a] longer-term shareholder value. So again, to answer your question on this second bucket, yes, we're moving very fast. And I would say again, we're much further ahead than I could have anticipated a year ago.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Thank you. John, longer-term gross margin question. When you first launched Burlington 2.0, I think you indicated there might be 100 basis points to 150 basis points of upside in the merch margin over time, really just through faster turns in lower markdowns, Q1 merch margin up 340 basis points, do you think that the opportunity on the merch margin line might be even greater than you first thought?\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, John. Good question. So, a couple things. So, first, I think you have to really put our Q1 gross margin performance into context. You know, both in terms of the history of our first quarters and then, you know, a lot of unique stuff happened in Q1. So, let me talk about the history first. Historically, Q1 hasn't been a good gross margin quarter for us. If you look back to 2019, for example, it was our lowest gross margin quarter of the year, about 80 basis points below are our full-year gross margin. So, you know, why has Q1 historically been a little weak for us? Well, you know, we've usually turned inventory slower in the first quarter. Usually we've carried over some clearance merchandise from the fall, which has a tendency to hurt our transition into the spring. Now, let's take a look at Q1 of 2021. Very unusual to say the least, we put up [a 20 comp], executed incredibly fast sales chase, and increased our inventory turns by nearly 60%, unprecedented improvement, and one that would be very difficult to sustain. So, these extraordinary turns are not something that we would ever plan for. And they were driven by way ahead of planned sales. And back in Q4, we also benefited from chasing ahead of planned sales that helped us to end Q4 with less fall merchandise than we would typically have. So, there was less to markdown in Q1, and was easier to transition quickly to spring. So, that's kind of a long way of saying that we had plenty of room for improvement historically in our first quarter. And we just put up a quarter, that'd be very difficult to replicate due to all the unique circumstances we have this year. Having said all of that, we continue to believe that we still have further room to reduce our comp store inventory levels, which should over time, reduce our markdowns, and drive even more improvements in our merchandise margin. And we would also expect that trade expense over time would normalize and put less pressure on our gross margin in the future. So, let's not extrapolate from one unusual exceptional quarter. We do think we can continue to make progress, but it's going to be really hard to predict that pace until we get into a more normal environment.\nJohn Kernan: All right, thank you.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, John.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Really fantastic Q1 here. I'm just looking \u2013 my question is on new store productivity. There's a huge spread, obviously, 15 point spread here between comp growth and total sales growth. So, it looks to us like new store productivity is coming in, you know, north of 100%. You know, were there some one-time benefits also helping your new store productivity numbers? And if you could sort of parse through the performance there and talk about where you would contemplate new store productivity trending for the year? That would be fantastic. Thanks.\nJohn Crimmins: So, Kimberly, this is John. I\u2019ll try to answer that one. So, a couple of things to keep in mind. You know, we're talking about new and non comp stores so that covers, you know, couple years of growth for the stores. And they're all benefiting from the same circumstances, the pent-up demand, the extra cash in customer's pocket, you know, similar to what we saw in our comp sales trend for the quarter. And having said that, we're extremely pleased with our new store performance. You know, they're doing very well against our underwriting assumptions. You know, like any other batch of stores there's some variability across the entire cohort, but overall, we're extremely pleased with the performance of the cohort. I don't know that there's anything unique that I would call out about the new stores. I think, you know, as I said, I think that conditions that are \u2013 the circumstances that are driving their performance are pretty much the same things we talked about for our comp store performance during the quarter.\nKimberly Greenberger: Thanks so much.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks Kimberly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from a line of Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys, thanks for taking our question here. Michael, I just want to \u2013 I want to ask why not take up the third quarter and fourth quarter sales off this performance? I mean, there's fairly visible stimulus coming later in the year, you obviously got at least your share in the first quarter. I'm just trying to think about what other puts and takes you might have put into the scenarios where you see flat comps in the back half of the year, knowing the stimulus is coming? And then, I guess, you know if we do see an upside sales scenario is, you know, maybe this one for John, but if we do see an upside sales scenario, I think the way you changed your plan for this year, you took the sales up about 500 million and I think EBITDA up about 85 million so about, you know, mid-to-high teens incremental margins. Is that the right way to think about sales upside through the rest of the year, John, if you beat the plan?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good. Well, good morning, Michael. I'll take the first part of that question. On Q3 and Q4, it's a good question. Yeah, I guess where I would start is just by reiterating that our baseline plan is just a baseline. And right now, Q3, and Q4, are planned flat and that provides our merchants with a plan that they can buy against, and it provides our operators with a starting point for capacities, staffing, and expense planning. That's all we really need now, at this point. That's all our merchants and our operators really need. We know that if the trend picks up or if \u2013 actually if the trend remains pretty strong, we can adjust the baseline. We look at the baseline literally every week. So, we can adjust the baseline. We can chase the sales. And I feel very confident that our merchants and our operators have that skill set and can chase the sales as they did in Q1 and before that in Q4. Now, I agree with you. We do see some positive factors on the horizon. You know the continuation of the vaccine rollout. And hopefully that means that life will start to normalize a little bit. In the second \u2013 we're already starting to normalize, but will normalize even more in the second half of the year. And then the child tax credits, which I believe will start to be rolled out in late July. You know, anything, typically anything that puts more money in our customers pocket is a good thing. We saw that in Q1. So that can be positive for the back half of the year. You know, the only reason to be wary or cautious is that the country hasn't yet fully recovered from the pandemic. You know, right now the situation is certainly looking better and more positive. But if there's one thing that the past year has taught us is that things can change pretty quickly. So the action implication for us is to plan and manage the business conservatively. And then be ready to chase a stronger trend and at approach has served us pretty well the last couple of quarters.\nJohn Crimmins: And then Michael I think you had a bit of a question on the flow through we would think about with incremental sales. Yeah, it's really difficult to project and that's one of the reasons why we kind of stayed away from trying to give any guidance here. You know, one of the elements of the chase is the importance of moving receipts very quickly. And with the volatility we see in the, kind of freight networks and the pressure on global retail supply chain, it's hard to anticipate what might cost us to, you know, to kind of move those receipts quickly enough to feed a trend. So, that may temper the flow through a little bit. It's a variable that we really can't predict right now.\nMichael Binetti: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys and congrats again.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in Burlington stores. We look forward to talking to you again in August to discuss our second quarter results. Meanwhile, [we tend to close] by wishing you all a very, very nice Memorial Day holiday. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the income statement. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. For the first quarter, total sales grew 35%, while comparable store sales increased by 20%. The gross margin rate in the first quarter was 43.3%, an increase of 230 basis points versus 2019's first quarter rate of 41.0%. This improvement was driven by a 340 basis point increase in our merchandise margins, which was attributable primarily to a reduction in markdowns. This merchandise margin increase more than offset a significant increase in freight expense, which was 110 basis points higher than 2019's first quarter rate. Product sourcing costs, which include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs were 141 million in the first quarter of 2021 versus 79 million in the first quarter of 2019, increasing 160 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs accounted for 140 basis points of this de-leverage. These expense pressures were consistent with what we had seen in Q4, with similar underlying drivers, higher wage rates and wage incentives, inefficiencies caused by safety protocols, and the disruption in the flow of receipts across the global retail supply chain. The balance of de-leverage in product sourcing costs came from higher buying costs. This is consistent with Burlington 2.0 and our strategy of investing in our merchandising capabilities. Adjusted SG&A was 518 million, versus 428 million in 2019, decreasing 260 basis points as a percentage of sales. SG&A leverage was primarily due to leverage in store related costs and marketing expense, as well as overall leverage and fixed costs achieved on a 20% comp. Adjusted EBIT margin increased by 360 basis points to 10.9% versus 7.2% in the first quarter of 2019. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share with $2.51 versus $1.15 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.59 versus $1.26 in the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 23 net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 784 stores. This included 26 new store openings, one relocation, and two closures. We ended the period, with available liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion including approximately 1.5 billion in unrestricted cash and 549 million of availability on our ABL. Our total balance sheet debt is now 2.1 billion, which includes 959 million on our term loan, 805 million in convertible notes, 300 million in high-yield senior secured notes, and no outstanding balance on our ABL. Given the improving visibility on the sales, earnings, and cash flow trajectory of our business, we are beginning to get more comfortable utilizing excess cash on our balance sheet to reduce our gross leverage. Accordingly, concurrent with our earnings release this morning, we announced that we initiated the process to execute a make-whole call that will fully redeem the $300 million of outstanding of our 6.25% high-yield senior secured notes. Given the strength and momentum of our business, we think that now is a good time to begin to reduce our leverage. Despite the recent strength of our business, the outlook remains very unpredictable. So, we are not providing specific sales or earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021, but as we did on our last earnings call, we would like to share some high level comments on how we are thinking about our possible financial performance for the full-year 2021. As Michael mentioned earlier, we will continue to plan sales cautiously and adjusted the trends that we see just as we did in the first quarter. Our current baseline comp sales plan for the second quarter is 10%. For the back half of the year, we are currently assuming a flattish comp, but we'll update these plans as visibility improves. This translates to a full-year comp baseline planning assumption of approximately 7%. As you think about total sales growth for the balance of FY 2021 versus FY 2019, you should remember to factor in two years of new stores over this time period. We opened 23 net new stores in Q1. Expect to open 9 net new stores in Q2, and 43 net new stores in the second half of 2021. The growth in new store and non-comp sales, combined with our comp baseline assumption of 7% will deliver approximately 20% total sales growth for the full fiscal year. One final point to make on sales. If you look further out and begin to model 2022, it will be important to back out the impact of one-time macro factors, such as the federal stimulus checks that contributed to our extraordinary sales performance in Q1. Of course, we will provide more information on our 2022 sales outlook much later this year or early next year. On our last earnings call we explained that our modeling would suggest an EBIT margin decline of 70 basis points to 80 basis points if comp sales were flat in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2019. Obviously, our stronger sales trend year to date should help this margin performance, but it's also important to call out that we now expect more severe expense pressure from freight and supply chain costs. These increased freight and supply chain expenses will drive more de-leverage than we had previously estimated. As a result, given our updated full-year comp baseline assumption of 7%, our modeling now suggests a full-year operating margin decline of 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Finally, we expect operating margin in the second quarter to be under more pressure than later in the year, as a result of increased freight and supply chain cost and the timing of some expenses. Specifically, we expect the operating margin to be down 70 basis points to 80 basis points in the second quarter due to the aforementioned factors. With that, I will turn it over to Michael for closing remarks. Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for your question. Obviously, a complicated situation. Earlier this year, we thought or maybe we hoped that some of the industry-wide supply chain issues would have started to settle down by now, but that clearly hasn't happened. In fact, the whole global supply chain situation seems to have gotten maybe even a little bit worse. There are really three key areas where the situation impacts us the most. I'll start with ocean freight as the first one. You've heard from everyone, there are significant capacity issues and delays with imports, especially shipments going through \u2013 coming into the West Coast ports. The demand for ocean freight is far exceeding the supply right now, and it's significantly driven up freight rates. At Burlington, we don't directly import a lot of merchandise ourselves, but the problem is that a lot of what we sell is imported, not by us, but by our vendors. So, the higher rates do affect us both the small part of our business where we import the product that we sell in the product that's imported by our vendors. These higher ocean freight costs end up hurting our merch margin. Second part where we have exposure is on domestic freights. It continues to be significant congestion in domestic freight networks, all modes of transportation. This congestion is affecting both the speed that we're able to move merchandise along with the cost. And the third area where we're impacted is in supply chain, particularly supply chain wages. In the areas of our country where our distribution facilities are located, we've seen some significant labor shortages. We've talked about this previously. Starting late last summer, we began to aggressively raise wages and wage incentives to track and to retain the workers that we need. That's worked for us. It's provided the stability that we need, but these pressures haven't totally gone away. And the volatility and receipt flow has added to these pressures by driving lower efficiency in our distribution centers. We're not able to plan when receipts are going to come in reliably, so we have to make a lot of adjustments and that has a negative impact on our ability to be efficient. And remember, throughout this year, we're comparing to 2019, so we have two years of wage inflation and we don't have the benefit of comparing to the increases in wages that we made in the fall of 2020. And to the second part of your question, are these costs permanent or transitory? Typically, external freight rates, whether it's ocean freight, road, or rail, it's tended to be driven by supply and demand. We don't really see a structural change here. We think that the issues we've been talking about are cyclical, and that over time, they will correct themselves. It does seem to be very much driven by an out of balance, supply and demand equation, exacerbated and extended by the huge pent up demand we're seeing with so many consumer products. So, we do think that the situation will get better. We just don't see that happening in 2021. On the supply chain expenses, we do believe that some portion of these costs, specifically the higher wage rates will be permanent, as we talked about on our Q4 call. That said, we do have a pretty good track record of finding offsets to these types of costs, through process changes, automation, or other productivity improvements. We already have a number of initiatives underway and we would expect to be able to at least partially offset these higher wage costs over time, but it will take a little time. And the final part of your question, now, we don't see anything in the current environment that causes us to doubt our ability to significantly increase our operating margin over the longer-term. In our business, there are always headwinds and pressures, but we don't see anything that might materially impact our ability to achieve our longer-term, margin potential. Yeah, Ike, thanks. Good question and good morning, by the way. Yeah, so I can't really speak to other retailers, but happy to add a little more color around how we think about our COVID costs. So, let's look backwards first, as you know, when we talked about the third and fourth quarter last year, we shared that we had COVID costs of $20 million in Q3, and $39 million in Q4. In the $39 million in Q4 included the significant full-year of thank you bonus for our non-exempt associates. So, I think what causes some confusion comparing to others is, we've got a kind of narrow definition, I think, for our COVID costs. We've included only what we see as the direct costs. So that means we include what we spend on personal protective equipment, on cleaning supplies, and incremental cleaning, and we include the cost of our front door ambassadors. Of course, there are many other costs that have been indirectly impacted by the pandemic. But we don't include them in this bucket that we use to collect what we're calling COVID costs.  Back at the end of the fourth quarter, we said, we were expecting quarterly COVID costs to be similar to the $20 million we had in Q3 for at least the first couple of quarters of 2021 or until the pandemic was going to be behind us. We're still continuing with the same level of safety and cleaning protocols that we had in place for 2020, but our COVID costs for Q1 were only about $14 million. So, let me explain that. We significantly overbought PPE, and cleaning supplies during 2020. So we were able to spend much less on replenishing those supplies during the first quarter. We're still prioritizing the safety and comfort of our customers and associates and are continuing with all of our safety protocols. And we'll keep doing that until it's clear that they're no longer needed. Thanks, Ike. Yeah, good morning Lorraine. Thanks. Good question or questions there. First, let me start off by just saying that, you know, obviously, we're really pleased with our operating margin performance in the first quarter, but it was just so outstanding that we \u2013 and we have a bunch of unique factors that we wouldn't expect that kind of sales performance for the second quarter or the balance of the year. You know, it was the 20% comp and the 35% sales growth that drove the [360 basis point] operating margin improvement. About two-thirds of the improvement was from gross margin and the other third from expense leverage. And all this was despite 110 basis point headwind in freight and 160 basis point headwind in product sourcing costs, but again, both the gross margin expansion and the SG&A leverage, it was really driven by the exceptional comp sales performance. So, as we've said earlier in my remarks, we're not planning for sales performance to be anything like we saw in the first quarter. We're planning for approximately 10%, up in Q2 comp sales and flattish for Q3 and Q4. These comp baseline planning assumptions would deliver a four year comp performance of about 7% when you factor them in with our Q1 sales. So, back in March, we've said that we would expect to see operating margin expansion began at about a six comp or slightly higher comp for this year. Our new outlook of 20 bips to 30 bips of de-leverage at the 7% comp includes the benefits of the strong flow through we saw in the first quarter. But it's more than offset by the increases we now expect in trade and supply chain costs for the balance of the year. And by some extents timing, that will affect us in the last three quarters of the year. So, as for the pressure on the second quarter, along with the incremental cost for freight and supply chain, the second quarters margin is going to be affected by some expense timing. So, let me try to explain what I mean by that. First, as we said in our remarks, we use reserve inventory to chase the high sales demand we saw during Q1. So that means during the second quarter, we're going to work to increase our incoming receipts to replenish our reserves to planned levels. And that's going to cause incremental expense in the second quarter. Then take some of the timing issues. So, we have an accounting policy that capitalizes freight as it's incurred, and then expenses it later when the inventory is ultimately sold. So what that means is, some of the increased costs we saw in Q1 will help hit our P&L a little later in the year, including in the second quarter. And then we also have some annual expenses that are accrued on a straight line basis for the full-year. So, this would include incentive comp accruals, which of course have been increased based on our new estimates of performance for the full-year. The straight line annual expenses are going to have a negative impact on flow through in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So, combining all these factors along with the second quarter being typically our small sales quarter for the year, that's how we got to our expectation of a 70 basis point to 80 basis point operating margin decline in the second quarter. Thanks, Lorraine. Thanks, John. Good question. So, a couple things. So, first, I think you have to really put our Q1 gross margin performance into context. You know, both in terms of the history of our first quarters and then, you know, a lot of unique stuff happened in Q1. So, let me talk about the history first. Historically, Q1 hasn't been a good gross margin quarter for us. If you look back to 2019, for example, it was our lowest gross margin quarter of the year, about 80 basis points below are our full-year gross margin. So, you know, why has Q1 historically been a little weak for us? Well, you know, we've usually turned inventory slower in the first quarter. Usually we've carried over some clearance merchandise from the fall, which has a tendency to hurt our transition into the spring. Now, let's take a look at Q1 of 2021. Very unusual to say the least, we put up [a 20 comp], executed incredibly fast sales chase, and increased our inventory turns by nearly 60%, unprecedented improvement, and one that would be very difficult to sustain. So, these extraordinary turns are not something that we would ever plan for. And they were driven by way ahead of planned sales. And back in Q4, we also benefited from chasing ahead of planned sales that helped us to end Q4 with less fall merchandise than we would typically have. So, there was less to markdown in Q1, and was easier to transition quickly to spring. So, that's kind of a long way of saying that we had plenty of room for improvement historically in our first quarter. And we just put up a quarter, that'd be very difficult to replicate due to all the unique circumstances we have this year. Having said all of that, we continue to believe that we still have further room to reduce our comp store inventory levels, which should over time, reduce our markdowns, and drive even more improvements in our merchandise margin. And we would also expect that trade expense over time would normalize and put less pressure on our gross margin in the future. So, let's not extrapolate from one unusual exceptional quarter. We do think we can continue to make progress, but it's going to be really hard to predict that pace until we get into a more normal environment. Thanks, John. So, Kimberly, this is John. I'll try to answer that one. So, a couple of things to keep in mind. You know, we're talking about new and non comp stores so that covers, you know, couple years of growth for the stores. And they're all benefiting from the same circumstances, the pent-up demand, the extra cash in customer's pocket, you know, similar to what we saw in our comp sales trend for the quarter. And having said that, we're extremely pleased with our new store performance. You know, they're doing very well against our underwriting assumptions. You know, like any other batch of stores there's some variability across the entire cohort, but overall, we're extremely pleased with the performance of the cohort. I don't know that there's anything unique that I would call out about the new stores. I think, you know, as I said, I think that conditions that are \u2013 the circumstances that are driving their performance are pretty much the same things we talked about for our comp store performance during the quarter. Thanks Kimberly. And then Michael I think you had a bit of a question on the flow through we would think about with incremental sales. Yeah, it's really difficult to project and that's one of the reasons why we kind of stayed away from trying to give any guidance here. You know, one of the elements of the chase is the importance of moving receipts very quickly. And with the volatility we see in the, kind of freight networks and the pressure on global retail supply chain, it's hard to anticipate what might cost us to, you know, to kind of move those receipts quickly enough to feed a trend. So, that may temper the flow through a little bit. It's a variable that we really can't predict right now. Thanks Michael."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're going to structure this morning's discussion as follows. First, I will review our first quarter results; second, I will discuss the outlook for the second quarter; and third, I will provide a high level update on the investments that we are making in our merchandizing organization. As you will recall, this is one of the most important initiatives in our Burlington 2.0 full potential strategy. After that, I will hand the call over to John, to walk through the financial details. Then, we will be happy to respond to any questions. As a reminder, the results we discuss for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 are being compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Given the impact of the pandemic last year, our 2020 results do not provide a good basis for comparability. Okay. So, let's talk about our results. In these quarterly earnings calls, we normally focus on comparable store sales growth. In a moment, I will discuss comp sales, but I would like to start my remarks today by highlighting our total sales growth in the first quarter. This includes new stores opened since 2019, as well as comp stores. Of course, total sales, is what really matters when looking at what is happening with market share. In the first quarter of 2021, our total sales grew by 35% versus the first quarter of 2019. We see this as early and direct evidence of our ability to take significant market share of the economy and the consumer emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, I will talk about comp store sales. Comparable store sales in the first quarter increased 20% versus the same period in fiscal 2019. For the quarter to date, through mid-March comp store sales were up mid-single-digits. From then on, they really took off for the balance of Q1, our comp trend averaged over 30% with the biggest surge coming in late March, and then moderating as we moved through April. We believe that there were a number of factors that drove this strong comp performance. These include the latest round of stimulus checks, the pace of the vaccine rollout, pent-up consumer demand, and our own very strong execution. In terms of category and regional performance, our strength in the first quarter was broad based. All our major merchandise categories outperformed their plans, and comp store sales in all regions of the country were well ahead of our expectations. Our gross margin in Q1 increased 230 basis points. This was despite a 110 basis point increase in freight expense. I was especially pleased with the 340 basis point increase in our merchandise margin, which was driven primarily by lower markdowns. Our receipts are fresher, we are turning faster, and we are capturing the margin benefits of these faster turns. The buying environment in the first quarter was very favorable and we were able to find great merchandise values to flow to stores and to fuel our ahead-of-plan sales trend. At quarter end, our in-store inventory levels were down 19% on a comp store basis. This was deliberate and consistent with our stated strategy of running our business with much leaner in-store inventory levels. In fact, our in-store inventory turns increased 59% on a comparable basis for Q1. Looking ahead, we are planning average comp store inventories to be down significantly throughout the year. But this does not mean they will necessarily be down at the end of every month and every quarter. We are more flexible, nimble, and opportunistic than ever before. This means that we will manage our receipt flow and our score inventories so we can capitalize on the sales opportunities as we see them. Reserve inventory increased to 35% of our total inventory at the end of the first quarter, versus 34% in the 2019 period. This modest increase disguises the fact that we made very heavy use of reserves during the quarter to chase the sales trend. Our reserve receipts during Q1 actually increased 45% versus the same period in 2019. In other words, we were able to make some great opportunistic and strategic buys to pack away in reserve, but at the same time, we moved up the release of other goods from reserves to fuel our trend. These were items that we had planned to release later in the spring that we float early to replenish our stores in April. Our merchants have gotten very skilled at using reserve this way. Now that I have reviewed the main elements of our Q1 results, I would like to take a moment to step back and provide some editorial commentary. The sales opportunity in Q1 was clearly attributable to external factors, especially the latest round of stimulus checks, but it is important to recognize that even when you get a slow pitch down the middle of the plate, you still have to make good contact. Even when the sales environment is favorable, you still have to chase it. That is what happened. We really connected with the ball in Q1, and we maximized our share of this sales opportunity. Our success in doing this was driven by strong execution of our core Burlington 2.0 initiatives. We recognize that our customers had a lot of choices in the first quarter as to where they could spend their stimulus dollars. We operate in an extremely competitive industry. We know that we have to earn our customers business by offering the best merchandise value across the assortment every day. Burlington 2.0 is enabling us to do this. I was very pleased with how well we executed in Q1 in all areas of the company: buying, planning, supply chain, stores, marketing, and all areas of the company combined together to deliver our strong Q1 results. Now, I would like to talk about the outlook for Q2. Based on our results for the first quarter, we have raised our internal baseline comp sales plan to positive 10% for Q2. At this point, we have not adjusted our baseline comp sales plans for Q3 and Q4. We have held those plans flat for now. I anticipate that we will make adjustments to Q3 and Q4 once we have greater visibility. As we have said before, it is important to understand that this baseline comp sales plan is just a planning tool. In this environment, the sales trend is extremely difficult to predict. By now, most of you know our playbook pretty well. We intend to manage our business flexibly if our comp trend during the second quarter exceeds 10%, then as we demonstrated in Q1 we have the ability to chase the stronger sales trend. And conversely of course, we can pull back if that turns out to be necessary. The other aspect of the outlook that I would like to call out is that we continue to face significant challenges driven by industry-wide supply chain issues. These issues are causing huge volatility and delays in receipt flow, and they are also driving significantly higher freight and supply chain expenses. In the first quarter, we were able to stay on top of these challenges. Our planning, distribution, and logistics teams did an outstanding job anticipating and working around these issues. This meant that despite the challenges, we were able to get fresh receipts to our stores in a timely fashion to fuel a strong sales trend. Meanwhile, our merchant margin performance and the expense leverage on ahead of plan sales in Q1 helped offset significant freight and supply chain expense headwinds. But, as you have heard from other retailers, these issues have not gone away. In fact, over the last few months, they have deteriorated. As John will describe in his remarks, we now believe that these issues will be with us for at least the balance of the year, and they will put some pressure on our margin recovery. I would like to move on now to provide an update on one of the core priorities within our Burlington 2.0 strategy, investment in our merchandising capabilities. We had ambitious growth plans for our merchandising organization coming into the year. And I am pleased to report that we're running ahead of these plans, both in terms of new hires, and promotions. One important milestone to share is that we recently signed a lease to double the square footage of our New York City buying office. I should also note that last year, we relocated our West Coast buying office to substantially bigger space. We are excited about our plans to grow out on the ground presence in New York and Los Angeles over the next few years. I'm also happy to report that we have a robust pipeline of candidates. There are three factors that are driving our ability to attract great merchandising talent. Firstly, candidates can see that we have a unique opportunity to grow our business over the next several years. Secondly, Burlington 2.0 is creating a huge amount of buzz, excitement, and energy around the strategic direction of the company. And thirdly, candidates are attracted to our culture. We do not often talk about this third point, but it is very important.  So, let me spend a few moments on it. I believe that the bedrock for any lasting and successful strategy is a strong culture, an inclusive and diverse workplace, where people are valued and respected, and where they are supported and encouraged to achieve their own full potential. We recognize that nurturing this culture is a journey, not a destination. That said, I believe that our culture is a major competitive advantage for us. In fact, we were recently voted to Fortunes 100 Best Companies to Work For. We were one of only seven retailers to be recognized on this list for 2021. We are proud of this award. It is a tribute to our associates, and to our managers and leaders throughout the company. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John to provide more detail on our first quarter financial performance. John? Thank you, John. Let me wrap up my remarks by reiterating the point that I made earlier. The sales opportunity in Q1 was attributable to external factors, especially the federal stimulus checks. But our success in maximizing our share of this opportunity was driven by our own strong execution of our Burlington 2.0 strategy. This execution was clear across buying, planning, supply chain stores, marketing, and all areas of the company. So, let me finish by [thanking everyone] at Burlington for such a strong all around team performance. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator? Well, good morning, Matt. Nice to hear from you. Thank you for asking that question. You know, I'm going to focus my answer on our performance rather than relative performance. Of course, we care about how we compare versus other retailers. Of course, we do, but we don't know what is going on in other companies. And of course, we have no control over what they do. The only thing that we control is our own performance. So with that said, let me talk about Burlington 2.0. As you know, we started telling the story of Burlington 2.0 back in February or March of 2020, which obviously was great timing, but despite the pandemic, we were able to push forward with the strategy throughout last year. You know, it's gratifying that in the last couple of quarters, we've started to see some of the early benefits. You know, it feels like we've been telling the story. And now it's really nice to be delivering some strong results to go along with it. As a reminder, the core premise of Burlington 2.0 is that we can be more off price, more flexible, and more responsive to the trend. And that by doing this, that we'll be able to drive significantly improved sales and profitability. Maybe what I should do is just take a few minutes to peel the onion a little bit and describe what that flexibility and responsiveness looked like across the company in Q1. I'll start with the merchandising team. In the first quarter, under Jennifer Vecchio's leadership, our merchants massively shifted the assortment from where it had been in 2019. Remember, that's what we're comparing ourselves against 2019. They did that based upon what the customer has been telling us and they chased into the hottest categories and trends. We controlled our liquidity extremely carefully. So, when the time came, we were able to support and fund our buyers as they went into the market and took advantage of some great opportunistic buys and some wow deals. Great value is what drives sales in off price and great value is certainly what drove our business in Q1. Moving on to planning, with all the uncertainty and volatility of the past year, our planners have become very agile and flexible, forecasting, and re-forecasting the business, and taking up and moving around open to buy dollars based upon trend and availability. Our planning team played a critical role as we chased from a baseline plan of a flat comp in Q1 to a actualized comp store sales growth of 20%., obviously that's a serious chase. Next, supply chain and logistics, you know, some of the biggest challenges we faced in Q1 were in supply chain and logistics. Global and domestic transportation networks were and continue to be a mess. Despite those issues, we processed more receipts in the month of March than we did in the comparable timeframe leading up to holiday last year. And normally, for holiday, we spend months preparing for peak receipt flow, but in an incredibly compressed timeframe, our supply chain and logistics teams, again demonstrated remarkable agility, and they were able to overcome the challenges that we faced. And then finally stores, we experienced huge sales volume to our stores in March. Again, comparable to the equivalent time period leading up to holiday, but unlike holiday, we didn't have time to go out and recruit seasonal staff. Our fields and store teams had to react very quickly with what they had. They did an amazing job flexing up to support the huge increase in sales. Hopefully, what comes across and what I've said is that we were very flexible, nimble, even entrepreneurial in Q1. We saw the sales opportunity and we went for it. I think it was a really, really good early demonstration of Burlington 2.0. Let me let me finish up just on second part of your question. Should you expect this kind of relative performance going forward? I guess, I could answer that by saying that we're enjoying this, we're pleased that we've had a couple of good quarters, but we know that it is just two quarters. We operate in an extremely competitive space. I would expect that the relative performance gap versus our peers that we've seen in the last couple of quarters is going to disappear or perhaps at least narrow in the coming months. I'd be very surprised if it didn't. Thanks Matt. Sure. Good morning, Ike. On the first part of your question, the drivers of our comp growth in Q1, maybe the \u2013 I think the best place to start is probably by going back to mid-March. At that point, our quarter to date comp was running up mid-single-digit. From that point on, the trend really accelerated. Our average comp growth for the remainder of the quarter, as I mentioned in my remarks was in excess of 30%. The biggest spike, as you'd expect, came in late March. And then the trend started to cool off in April. It held up pretty well. But obviously it cooled off after that spike in late March.  Now, we think there were a few factors that drove that sales trend. Most significant by far were the federal stimulus checks. During March, the government published data every day, showing the value of checks that were sent out in the previous day. So, it was not difficult for any retailer to correlate that data with their own sales trend. You know, our own modeling suggests that those checks were worth 10 percentage points to 15 percentage points of comp store sales growth in Q1. Now, of course, our overall comp growth actualized at 20%. So, we think the remaining 5 points to 10 points of comp is explainable from two other factors, two other sets of factors. Firstly, obviously, the pace of the vaccine rollout accelerated during the quarter, and somewhat related to that, we think that there was some pent up demand that helped drive the trend, as consumers saw a path whereby their lives might start to return to normal. It's hard to quantify the impact of those factors, but we believe that they helped sustain our comp trend through April and even into May. And I'm going to talk about the main month to date trend in a moment. The other important factor with our own performance, I think that we have to give ourselves some credit here or our comp growth in Q1, our strong execution in the quarter really helped to maximize our share of the sales opportunity. That's a good segue, I think, to the second part of your question about the month to date trends in May. As a reminder, our baseline comp plan for Q2 is 10%. And at this point, obviously, we're 3.5 weeks into May. Our comp sales trend is running ahead of this baseline. So that gives us confidence in our Q2 baseline of 10%. So, let me finish up as I usually do by saying that we are ready to taste the sales trends, whatever it turns out to be or to pull back, depending upon how things play out, just as we get in Q1. Thanks, Ike. Good morning, John. Thank you for the question. I think the easiest way to answer that question is probably to separate out our Burlington 2.0 priorities and initiatives into a couple of major buckets. Firstly, there are things that we're doing, changes that we're making, and we have been making that are already affecting the business and already driving performance. So, I'll talk about those in a moment. And then secondly, there are other things that we're doing and investments that we're making that by design will take time to really, really impact the business. So, first bucket includes a number of very important changes and priorities, including a much greater focus on value, more conservative planning to set up a stronger chase, tighter control of liquidity, lower inventory levels, tighter control of expenses, more flexible operating processes. And these are all things that we started doing last year. And I think they've really helped to drive that performance over the last couple of quarters. Now to answer your question, are we further along on these areas than I would have anticipated a year ago? I would say, yes, absolutely. We're much further along. It's been very impressive to see how our merchants and our operators have embraced Burlington 2.0 over the past year. Now, that's not to say that we can't get better in all of those areas, we know that we can. There are other changes and improvements that we're planning to make across the business that should make the chase more effective across buying, planning, supply chain, and stores. So that's the first bucket. The second bucket includes changes, priorities, investments, that we're moving [full steam] ahead with, but that will take time to really impact the business. I stress that in many ways, these items will be much more important in terms of their longer-term benefits to the company. Just to dwell on two of those for a moment. Of course, the one big one, which I mentioned earlier, the investment that we're making, in our merchandising capabilities, this is going to \u2013 that's going to be critical to our ability to offer great value to customers. And that's really the key to driving our sales over the longer-term. Now, as I said in my remarks, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in strengthening our merchandising organization. The other longer term item to call out is the work that we've been doing on our new store prototype and our new store opening program. We talked a little bit about those on the March call. Again, I feel like we've made a lot of progress, but realistically, the big significant savings from this new store program are going to express themselves in 3, 4, 5 years time. I'm very confident that that program is going to [drive a] longer-term shareholder value. So again, to answer your question on this second bucket, yes, we're moving very fast. And I would say again, we're much further ahead than I could have anticipated a year ago. Thanks, John. Good. Well, good morning, Michael. I'll take the first part of that question. On Q3 and Q4, it's a good question. Yeah, I guess where I would start is just by reiterating that our baseline plan is just a baseline. And right now, Q3, and Q4, are planned flat and that provides our merchants with a plan that they can buy against, and it provides our operators with a starting point for capacities, staffing, and expense planning. That's all we really need now, at this point. That's all our merchants and our operators really need. We know that if the trend picks up or if \u2013 actually if the trend remains pretty strong, we can adjust the baseline. We look at the baseline literally every week. So, we can adjust the baseline. We can chase the sales. And I feel very confident that our merchants and our operators have that skill set and can chase the sales as they did in Q1 and before that in Q4. Now, I agree with you. We do see some positive factors on the horizon. You know the continuation of the vaccine rollout. And hopefully that means that life will start to normalize a little bit. In the second \u2013 we're already starting to normalize, but will normalize even more in the second half of the year. And then the child tax credits, which I believe will start to be rolled out in late July. You know, anything, typically anything that puts more money in our customers pocket is a good thing. We saw that in Q1. So that can be positive for the back half of the year. You know, the only reason to be wary or cautious is that the country hasn't yet fully recovered from the pandemic. You know, right now the situation is certainly looking better and more positive. But if there's one thing that the past year has taught us is that things can change pretty quickly. So the action implication for us is to plan and manage the business conservatively. And then be ready to chase a stronger trend and at approach has served us pretty well the last couple of quarters. Thanks Michael. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your questions and your interest in Burlington stores. We look forward to talking to you again in August to discuss our second quarter results. Meanwhile, [we tend to close] by wishing you all a very, very nice Memorial Day holiday. Thank you."

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our fourth quarter results; secondly, I will talk about our 2023 guidance; and finally, I\u2019ll offer some comments on our longer term outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our fourth quarter results and our 2023 guidance, then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let\u2019s talk about our Q4 results. Comp store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 2%. This was on top of 6% comparable store sales growth last year. As we have done on previous calls, today when we are describing our comp trend, we will use a three-year geometric stack. This metric is defined in more detail in today\u2019s press release. Our three-year geometric stack was positive 4% for the fourth quarter. As we shared on our Q3 call, our three-year geometric stack for November was flat to the prior year. As the quarter progressed, our sales trend improved sequentially. On a one-year basis and a three-year basis, our comp growth in both December and January was positive, with January stronger than December. We believe that there were two drivers of the improvement in our trend. Firstly, we took a number of actions in the back half of last year to sharpen our values. We described these in some detail on our November call, so this morning I am just going to summarize a couple of points. Number one, we backed off our original plan to raise prices. The consumer and promotional environment changed rapidly last year and it became clear that this was not the right time to be raising prices. Instead, in the fourth quarter we sharpened our values on fresh receipts and we aggressively used markdowns to drive faster turns on existing inventory. We focused especially heavily on expanding opening price points in our assortment. Number two, we significantly raised receipt plans and inventory levels in our strongest businesses and focused this open-to-buy on great opportunistic deals. The off-price supply environment was very strong in Q4 and we were able to take advantage of some incredible buys, especially on branded merchandise. We flowed many of these receipts to stores to fuel the stronger trend and we also tucked away some of these goods in reserve for later release.  These actions worked. Shoppers responded to our sharper values, expanded opening price points, and great branded buys. This led to a significant improvement in customer conversion and in average transaction size; in other words, shoppers liked the values that they found when they walked into our stores.  In Q4, we also saw an improvement in traffic. This points to the second driver of our stronger trend. We interpret this improvement in traffic as a sign that the macro headwinds may have started to abate. In particular, although inflation is still elevated, we are beginning to lap the significant spike that occurred in late 2021 into early 2022.  Let me move on now and talk about the outlook for the year ahead. As we said in November, we anticipate that in 2023, the economy will slow down and that inflation will continue to fall. We expect the inventory overhang across retail to diminish and this should lead to less promotional activity. If the external environment unfolds as I have just described, we believe that this could have three major implications for Burlington. First, the economic slowdown should create a greater consumer focus on value, potentially driving some trade-down activity from middle and higher income groups. Second, our value differentiation versus other retailers could grow as promotions moderate, and this should be a tailwind for traffic, conversion and transaction size. Third, we expect that the external expense environment will improve compared to last year. We are already seeing this start to happen with freight rates. There is one other factor that is important to call out, and this one is specific to Burlington. We executed poorly in 2022 and this hurt our trend. Once we corrected these mistakes late in the year, we saw an improvement. Obviously in 2023, we will be lapping these issues and we expect to drive stronger results.  These are the major reasons why we feel optimistic about 2023; but with all that being said, we recognize that there are some uncertainties and potential headwinds ahead. In particular, we remain concerned about the lower income customer, our core customer. In 2022, this customer group bore the brunt of the impact of inflation on real household incomes. We think the impact of inflation will moderate this year but there are other factors that could hurt this customer, such as a rise in unemployment and the ending of expanded SNAP benefits.  Putting all these factors together, we are guiding full year comp sales growth in the range of positive 3% to positive 5%. We believe that there may be upside to this range and we are managing our business to chase potential upside. Given this comp range, we expect to be able to drive 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion in 2023.  As we said in November, we believe we can get back to pre-pandemic margin levels within the next few years, but there are two reasons to be cautious on our 2023 margin. Firstly, our number one priority as we develop our budget and operating plans for 2023 was to drive sales. This means keeping our values as sharp as possible. Given the strong supply environment, we expect an increase in merchant margin, but this is balanced by the need to pass along great value to our customers to drive the trend.  The second reason to be cautious relates to expenses. As described earlier, we expect the external expense environment, specifically freight rates to improve in 2023, but it is difficult to predict how significant an impact this might have over the full year. Also, as Kristin will explain, in Q4 we incurred higher supply chain expenses as we pushed more aggressively into great opportunistic off-price buys. This merchandise drives sales and value, but it is typically more difficult and expensive to process. For the last couple of years, we have been taking actions to make our distribution centers more off-price and more efficient, but we still have work to do and this work will take time.  Let me sum up our 2023 guidance. We are planning and managing our business to support positive 3% to 5% comp growth, but we are ready to chase the trend if it is stronger. As for operating margin, we believe that we can get back to pre-pandemic operating margins within the next few years. For 2023, we are planning 80 to 120 basis points of expansion on 3% to 5% comp growth.  I would like to move on now and talk about our new store opening plans for 2023. We continue to be very pleased by the relative performance of our new stores, especially our new store format. In 2023, we are planning to open 90 to 100 gross new stores. After relocations and closures, this should yield 70 to 80 net new stores. This is lower than we would like and reflects the current lack of high quality real estate locations, as well as supply issues within the construction industry. That said, we believe that this situation could be about to change. Over the next couple of years, we think that there could be a wave of consolidation in bricks and mortar retail, and we anticipate that this could drive a significant increase in the number of high quality new store locations, so once we get through 2023, we believe that we can grow our new store program such that we will open 500 to 600 net new stores over the following five years. Before I hand over to Kristin, let me make some high level comments about the longer term outlook for Burlington. As I said earlier, we are optimistic about 2023, but looking further out we also see reasons to be bullish about the longer term. There are two factors in particular that I would like to highlight.  Firstly, we anticipate that the external environment for full price retail will remain difficult and uncertain over the next few years. We expect that many traditional retailers may struggle. This should drive strong off-price merchandise supply and, as I mentioned a moment ago, may lead to additional bricks and mortar retail consolidation. In this environment, we believe that off-price retailers have a major opportunity to take share.  Secondly, here at Burlington over the last two to three years, we have been busy investing in our business to transform ourselves into a stronger off-price retailer. For example, we have invested in our merchandising capabilities, we have made major changes in our stores organization to be more flexible and off-price, and we have changed our new store prototype to be more productive and efficient.  As I acknowledged in November, some of these initiatives are a work in process, but the overall strategic direction is clear: we are working to transform ourselves into a stronger off-price retailer, so as we look beyond 2023, we are very excited. We believe that the combination of these factors, firstly the potential dislocation and consolidation of traditional retail, and secondly the transformation of Burlington into a stronger off-price retailer could drive significant growth in sales, earnings and shareholder value over the next several years. I would now like to turn the call over to Kristin to provide more details on our Q4 results and our 2023 guidance.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks Michael and good morning everyone. Let me start with some additional financial details for the fourth quarter. Total sales in the quarter grew 5% while comp sales were down 2%. As Michael mentioned, our three-year geometric comp stack was a positive 4%. Comp sales and adjusted EPS came in above our guidance range. For Q4, our adjusted EPS was $2.96, which was above our guidance range of $2.45 to $2.75.  The gross margin rate was 40.7%, an increase of 90 basis points versus 2021\u2019s fourth quarter rate of 39.8%. This was driven by a 130 basis point improvement in freight expense but was partially offset by a 40 basis point decline in merchandise margin. The decline in merchandise margin was primarily driven by higher markdowns a we moved to sharpen our values, as Michael discussed earlier in the call.  Product sourcing costs were $187 million compared to $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, increasing 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs. We worked a higher mix of true close-out merchandise which is more labor intensive to process. In addition, the movement in and out of our reserve inventory to chase the trend was less efficient and drove higher supply chain expense. Adjusted SG&A was $593 million versus $578 million in 2021, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was driven by strong expense control and a lower bonus accrual.  Adjusted EBIT margin was 10%, 80 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Relative to our Q4 2019 adjusted EBIT margin, 2022\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin declined by 340 basis points, driven entirely by supply chain and freight deleverage.  All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.83 versus $1.80 in Q4 of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.96 versus $2.53 in the fourth quarter of 2021.  At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 32% above 2021. As a reminder, last year as we came into the spring season, our store inventories were too lean and this hurt our sales trend in Q1, so the significant increase in our comparable store inventories was by design. I should also point out that this is still well below pre-pandemic levels.  At the end of the quarter, our reserve inventory was 48% of our total inventory versus 50% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values we have in reserve.  In the fourth quarter, we opened 34 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 927 stores. This included 39 new store openings, five relocations, and no closings. For the full year, we opened 113 new stores while relocating 22 stores and closing four stores, adding 87 net new stores to our fleet.  I will now move on to discuss our full year 2022 results.  Total sales decreased 7% and comp store sales decreased 13%. Our three-year geometric comp stack was flat. Our operating margin for the full year contracted by 370 basis points. Merchandise margin decreased by 110 basis points, freight de-levered by 10 basis points, product sourcing costs de-levered by 120 basis points, and adjusted SG&A de-levered by 110 basis points versus full year 2021.  Let\u2019s now move to 2023 guidance. For the 2023 fiscal year, we expect total sales growth in the range of 12% to 14%. This includes an approximately 2% impact related to the 53rd week. We expect comp store sales to increase in the range of 3% to 5% for fiscal 2023, and our adjusted EBIT margin to increase 80 to 120 basis points versus last year.  Capital expenditures net of landlord allowances is expected to be approximately $560 million. This results in adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.50 to $6, an expected increase of 29% to 41%. This outlook includes an adjusted EPS contribution of $0.05 from the 53rd week. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total sales growth in the range of 12% to 14%. Comp store sales are assumed to increase between 5% and 7%. We are expecting adjusted EBIT margins to increase in the range of 120 to 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2022, which results in an adjusted EPS outlook in the range of $0.85 to $0.95.  I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you Kristin.  Before we move to questions, let me recap some of the key points that we have covered this morning. We saw a significant and sequential improvement in our sales trend in Q4. We believe that this was partly driven by better execution, specifically our focus on sharper value but also partly driven by an improvement in the external environment. We are optimistic about the outlook for 2023. We are planning and managing our business for positive 3% to 5% comp sales growth, but we are ready to chase if the trend is stronger. Our number one priority in 2023 is to drive sales. On 3% to 5% comp sales growth, we expect to achieve 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion.  Longer term beyond 2023, we are excited about the prospects for our business. We anticipate that the next few years will see significant disruption and dislocation across retail. We are pushing forward with the transformation of Burlington into a stronger off-price retailer, and this should help us to take advantage of the opportunities this disruption may present. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe first on your 2023 comp guidance, is there any additional commentary that you can provide on the 3% to 5% comp range, or how should we think about whether there\u2019s potential upside to this range? Then I have a follow-up.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Matt. Thanks for the question. As we developed our 2023 comp guidance, I would say that there was three main reference points that we used. Firstly, we looked at our own multi-year comparisons. I won\u2019t drag you through all the numbers, but we looked at our business on a one-year, a two-year, a four-year basis and we then compared that data with the low single digit annual comp growth that we would historically have expected before the pandemic, so that was the first reference point. Secondly, we looked at our off-price peers. Our comp performance last year was significantly inferior to theirs. Now, we recognize that that may have been partially driven by differences in customer demographics, but we believe it was also driven by significant differences in execution. We know that we made mistakes last year and in 2023, we certainly don\u2019t intend to repeat those mistakes. Thirdly, the third reference point, if you like, is that we looked at our most recent trend. Our Q4 comp sales were 4% ahead of 2019 levels. Our 2023 comp guide implies that comp sales this year will be 3% to 5% ahead of 2019 levels; in other words, our guide is consistent with Q4.  One other data point that I would offer up, though, is that our quarter-to-date trend is running ahead of our Q1 guidance, and that trend gives us additional confidence in our comp guidance. Now, the various points of reference that I\u2019ve just described suggest that our comp guidance for 2023 is achievable, but it\u2019s important to add that there are unknowns out there. There\u2019s a lot of economic uncertainty and we don\u2019t know how that uncertainty will play out in 2023. I think I\u2019ve said before that setting comp guidance is not an exact science, but in our business that\u2019s okay. If we manage our business flexibly, then if the sales trend is stronger, we know that we can chase higher trend, so I guess I\u2019d sum it up by saying we think our guidance is appropriate but we recognize there may be upside, and if there is, we\u2019re ready to chase it.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks. Then maybe just a follow-up on your margin guidance. In the prepared remarks, I think you cited 80 to 120 basis points of operating margin expansion on that 3% to 5% comp range. What are the key drivers of expansion, and again, is there a way to think about potential upside to this forecast as well?\nKristin Wolfe: Hi Matt, good morning. Thanks for the question.  You\u2019re right - for the full year 2023, we\u2019re guiding a 3% to 5% comp growth, 12% to 14% total sales growth that includes the 53rd week. On that 3% to 5% comp growth, as you said, we\u2019re modeling 80 to 120 basis points of operating margin expansion. This really comes from three main sources: higher merchandise margin, lower freight costs, and leverage on fixed expenses. Let me speak quickly to each of these items. On merchandise margin, given the extremely strong off-price environment, we believe we should be able to see some increase in merchandise margin; but as Michael said in the prepared remarks, our number one goal this year is to drive sales, and that will mean passing along values to our customers. So in other words, while we do expect an increase in merchandise margin, we\u2019re not intending to maximize this increase. Our intent is to prioritize sales comp growth. The second item I mentioned is the lower freight expenses. We\u2019re up against extraordinarily high freight costs from last year, particularly in the first part of the year, and we expect to see lower freight expenses especially in Q1 and Q2.  The third source of margin expansion is the leverage on store fixed expenses, like occupancy. Of course, some of this will depend on the level of comp sales, which is yet another reason why we\u2019re focused on the top line. There are also headwinds built into our 2023 guidance. These include limited or less improvement in supply chain given that increased mix of true close-out merchandise and also the resetting of incentive comp, assuming that we hit our plan.  For 2023, I\u2019d like to stay away from specific line item guidance, and the reason is this year our overriding strategy is to drive sales. We recognize that means we need to be flexible, so depending on how the year unfolds, there may be times in the year we might want to sharpen our values to further drive sales, which could drive a slightly lower merchandise margin but greater leverage on fixed expenses. To recap, on the 3% to 5% comp growth, we expect to achieve 80 to 120 basis points of operating margin expansion. We believe this will come from three primary sources: merchandise margin, freight and leverage on store fixed expenses, but the contribution from each of these will really depend on how the retail and competitive environment unfolds this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJesse Sobelson: Good morning everyone, this is Jesse Sobelson on for Ike. Congratulations on your improved trend in Q4. I just have a couple of questions. Firstly, I am wondering whether the improved trend means that the merchandising mistakes that you described back in November are now behind you, and I have a follow-up for Kristin.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Jesse. I think to answer that question, and as much as I hate to do this, let me start by describing the specific execution mistakes that contributed to our performance last year. If I was to share our internal post mortem, I would say that those mistakes fell into three main areas. Firstly, given the uncertain environment as we came into 2022, we deliberately planned inventory levels conservatively - this is a year ago, and those conservative inventory levels backfired on us. Like many other retailers certainly in the first quarter of last year and coming into the first quarter of last year, we experienced significant receipt volatility and delays, and those delays meant that we just ended up with too little on-hand inventory in our stores, and that really undermined our sales trend. The second thing I would say is in 2021, going back to 2021, we were reluctant to push up prices. Many other retailers at the time were talking about raising retails. We were reluctant to do that, but then as we came into 2022, I think we kind of questioned ourselves and said, well, maybe we\u2019re wrong, maybe we should start pushing up prices, so we added higher retails into our 2022 plans to really happen in the summer and into to back half of the year. Now in retrospect, with the impact of inflation on our core customer and with the higher promotional activity across retail, that was just not a good time to go raising prices. As we got into the full season, we realized that and we began to unwind those increases. Now, we should have done that sooner, but--anyway. It hurt our sales, especially in Q3, I would say.  Thirdly, in 2022 there was some huge shifts in the types of merchandise that the customer was interested in buying, and across our business, we didn\u2019t do a good enough job reacting and responding to those trends and those shifts.  Those were the three big buckets of mistakes that we think we made last year, and to answer your question on a tactical level, I would say yes, we believe those issues are behind us. We worked to correct the inventory and the receipt issues that we ran into last year, and we significantly sharpened our values and we shifted our assortment into the categories that we believe the customer is most interested in buying, and I think all of those changes paid off and really contributed to our stronger trend in the fourth quarter. I do want to just go a little bit further, though, in answering your question and just take a step back and maybe put those mistakes, if you like, in a bigger strategic context. I talked a little bit about this on our call in November. I think it\u2019s important to understand that over the last few years, we\u2019ve been doing a lot to transform our business, in particular we\u2019ve invested heavily to strengthen our merchandising capabilities. Since 2019, we\u2019ve hired or promoted tremendous talent and we\u2019ve developed and we\u2019re rolling out many, many new tools and processes for our merchants. Our buying team is now about 50% bigger in terms of headcount than it was in 2019. We know that merchandising is how you win in off-price, so we\u2019ve assembled all the key ingredients - very experienced off-price merchant leadership, tremendous buying talent, improved buying and planning processes and new tools, training and reports. We\u2019ve moved very fast - we had to, we\u2019re playing catch-up. Now, as they gel, those investments in my view are going to drive our growth and success over the next few years, but I have to acknowledge the mistakes we made in 2022 demonstrate that this is a work in process. I\u2019m pleased that we corrected our mistakes and turned around our performance towards year-end, but we really need to be able to move faster and with greater consistency than we did last year.\nJesse Sobelson: Okay, great. Thanks for the detail there. My second question is for Kristin. Can you provide any more detail on the margin puts and takes for Q4, for example what impact did incentive comp have on the quarter? Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning Jesse, thanks for the question.  Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our fourth quarter results, particularly the improvement in our comp store sales trend and that momentum that built during the quarter and continued into February. But as you noted, the flow-through on those incremental sales was not as strong as is typical for us, and that was primarily due to higher supply chain expenses. At a high level, our gross margin was pretty much where we expected as you look at the combination of 130 basis points of freight improvement more than offsetting slightly lower merchandise margins, which was driven by higher markdowns as we moved to sharpen values, as Michael noted. Product sourcing cost did de-lever somewhat more than we expected, which was primarily due to 60 basis points of supply chain de-leverage. Now on adjusted SG&A, that leverage - 50 basis points - and excluding the incentive comp adjustment, the adjusted SG&A rate would have been flat to the fourth quarter last year, which is still fairly strong expense control given the negative comp in the quarter. \nJesse Sobelson: Great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks, good morning. Kristin, in the prepared remarks, you called out supply chain expenses as unfavorable. What drove this, and how should we think about these costs going forward?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning Lorraine, thanks for the question. I\u2019d like to separate out two different factors that have contributed to higher supply chain costs at Burlington over the last few years. The first is there\u2019s a big piece of our higher supply chain costs that we should call externally driven, so over the last few years, there\u2019s been significant inflation in distribution center wage costs and then of course delays and volatility in global supply chains which have caused DC operations to be less efficient. This is not unique to Burlington. Other retailers, particularly those with lower average unit retails, have faced similar pressures, and we believe some of these higher costs, especially the higher wage rates, are likely here to stay; but we expect as global supply chain conditions continue to normalize, we should be able to drive some efficiencies and savings here. But the second factor on supply chain is really more specific to Burlington. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve changed the mix of type of buy in our business. We now buy a much higher proportion of true off-price goods and this shift in that buy type mix in Q4 was even more extreme as we took advantage of fantastic opportunistic off-price buys. These deals, these buys are much more complex to process and have a higher work content in our DCs. We also heavily utilized reserve inventory in the quarter as we took advantage of opportunistic buys and to chase the trend, so those are the factors that drove up our supply chain expenses in Q4. As we look forward, we do expect to maintain a higher mix of true off-price merchandise than we have historically, though it may not be as extreme as it was in the fourth quarter. The final point to make here is we know we have opportunity in supply chain. We have work to do. Our distribution centers, the systems, the processes were not originally designed and really were never optimized with off-price in mind, so in the last few years, we\u2019re working hard to take actions to make our supply chain more flexible, more efficient and more off-price, but we have more work to do here, and there are some of these changes that are going to take time.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks, and then Michael, it sounds like the buying environment has been very strong. What do you think will happen to merchandise availability as we move further into the year, and how will that impact the business?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Lorraine. I would say that the availability of off-price merchandise has been very strong over the last five, six months, and I think we\u2019ve heard that reported elsewhere as well. I would also say that I think our merchants have done a really good job leaning into that availability. We\u2019ve made sure that we\u2019ve controlled liquidity, so we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of some really great deals. Now, it\u2019s not difficult to understand why the off-price buying environment has been so strong in that period. In early 2022, we started to see a surge in supply as transportation bottlenecks finally began to clear, and that surge in supply then coincided with a weakening in consumer demand across retail as the year went on. Not surprisingly, too much supply, too little demand equals off-price availability, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. But there are a couple other points that I\u2019d like to make about merchandise supply. Firstly, as the third largest off-price retailer, this supply environment has given us the opportunity to open up new vendors and resources and to deepen relationships with existing vendors. We\u2019ve worked very hard to partner with vendors to help them move excess inventory over the last few months. Our buyers have been very, very focused on that - we\u2019ve been very responsive to vendors, and I think those new and expanded relationships are going to be very valuable to us strategically over the longer term. The second point to make is our expectation is that the buying environment is likely to remain fairly strong well into 2023, especially if the economy slows down and demand continues to soften. When you look at off-price availability over a longer time period, I think the real aberration is not how strong supply has been over the last six months. There have been plenty of times like this in the past. The real aberration is how constrained supply was between mid-2020 and early to mid 2022. Those constraints during that two-year period were driven by global supply chain issues coming out of the pandemic - we really hadn\u2019t seen those before. We think it\u2019s possible that the strong merchandise availability that we\u2019ve seen over the last six months, it may just herald a return to normal.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning Michael, Kristin, David. First question is just on long term operating margin. Previously, you\u2019ve said that you thought you\u2019d get back to the 2019 operating margin of 9.4% within the next few years. Can you just talk to the path for getting back to those levels? I just have a follow-up after that.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, good morning John. That\u2019s a good question.  Once we get through 2023, we plan to provide an update on our long range financial plan, and that will include a multi-year forecast for operating margin. Frankly, for that update to have credibility, we have to get through 2023 first; but in the interim and to try and answer your question, let me offer up some comments to illustrate what kind of things might be in that plan and how are we thinking about operating margin. I\u2019ll start with the data. Our operating margin in 2022 was 430 basis points below our 2019 levels. You can break out that variance into four main components, four main buckets. Firstly, merchandise margin - now, merchandise margin in 2022 was actually about 50 basis points higher than it was in 2019, and that was driven by a higher mix of off-price merchandise and faster, much faster inventory turns. The environment in 2022, as we said, was very promotional, and that meant that we really had to sharpen our values, and that negatively impacted merchandise margin in 2022. In fact, not to confuse everyone, but although our merchant margin was up 50 basis points in 2022 versus 2019, it actually fell by about 110 basis points versus 2021. We look at that set of numbers and we think there\u2019s upside to margin over the next couple of years, and we believe we have an opportunity to get back closer to the 2021 levels.  Now that said, and Kristin emphasized this point, in the near term we want to be very careful about how aggressively we go after that. As we\u2019ve said on this call, our priority in 2023 is really to drive sales rather than to maximize margin. Anyway, that\u2019s the first sort of driver of variance versus 2019. The second driver of margin variance in 2022 versus 2019 was higher freight expense. Those expenses were 180 basis points higher than 2019, and the lion\u2019s share of that increase was driven by external freight rates. Now, we expect to recover a significant proportion of that deleverage as freight rates normalize in the next couple of years, and as we mentioned earlier, we\u2019re starting to see some of that. The third source of variance is higher supply chain expenses. Again, in 2022 versus 2019, those were 230 basis points worse. As global supply chains begin to normalize, we fully expect that the timing of receipt flows will become more predictable and more reliable, and we believe that as slowing economy may dampen labor costs and turnover in our distribution centers, and those two factors could drive some savings in supply chain expenses but we\u2019re being a little cautious there, because as Kristin said a moment ago, some of the higher costs versus 2019, we believe have been driven by the shift in our business to becoming more off-price, and it\u2019s going to take a bit longer to address those costs. The fourth source of operating margin variance since 2019, I\u2019m going to call all other expenses. Now, all other expenses de-levered by about 70 basis points in 2022 versus 2019. That bucket includes some areas of the business where we\u2019ve actually driven greater efficiency, but those savings have been more than offset by deleverage on fixed expenses, especially fixed store expenses like occupancy. That deleverage is not a surprise, it\u2019s the result of a flat comp, essentially flat comp sales over a three-year period, so that\u2019s another reason why our priority in 2023 is to drive the top line. The more we can drive sales, the more leverage we can see on those fixed expenses. I guess to bring my answer back to one place, I guess our path back to 2019 margins is likely to have four main components: number one, a focus on higher sales, especially in 2023, higher sales drive leverage; number two, lower freight expenses as external rates normalize in the next couple of years, and we\u2019re starting to see that happen; number three, higher merchant margin as the highly promotional environment of last year begins to recede; number four, supply chain efficiencies but, for the reasons we\u2019ve outlined, some of those may take a little bit of time. Let me sort of finish up with just one final point. The question you asked was how will we get back to 2019 margins. Now, we feel good about the levers I\u2019ve just outlined, but we don\u2019t regard 2019 margins as our final destination. We still believe that we can drive operating margin beyond 2019 levels. The key premise of Burlington 2.0 is that we can drive stronger sales productivity with lower inventory levels and in a smaller store format. By doing all those things, we believe we can drive our operating margin above historic levels and thereby start to close the gap versus our off-price peers.\nJohn Kernan: That\u2019s a lot of detail and great color, Michael. Thank you. I guess Kristin, inventory levels at the end of January were up a decent amount versus last year, but you may have been under-inventoried last spring. Is there any additional commentary you can provide on inventory, and how should we think about inventory levels as we get further into 2023?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning John, thanks for the question. Yes, you\u2019re right - our comp store inventories were up 32% at the end of January, and as you noted and I think Michael responded to Jesse\u2019s question, last year we were under-inventoried at this time at the end of Q4. At the end of Q4 last year, we were down 30% versus 2019, and so when you adjust these numbers for compounding, this means our comparable store inventories are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Last year, the combination of conservative sales and inventory plans plus significant receipt disruptions and delays meant that our in-store inventories in February and March were well below where they needed to be, but by April they had recovered, but this situation undermined our sales in Q1 as Michael described earlier. This year, we deliberately increased inventory levels coming into the quarter - that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that 32% increase, and as we get into April, our comparable store inventories should be more in line with 2022, and as we move through the rest of this year, there may be variations by month but inventories will be similar to last year. That was store inventories, but let me shift quickly to talk about reserve inventories. A moment ago, Michael described how over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve become more off-price in terms of the type of merchandise we buy, and a key enabler of this is how we use and expanded our reserve inventory. This provides us with the ability to take advantage of great opportunistic deals, even on merchandise that does not make sense to flow to stores right away. At the end of 2022, our reserve inventory was significantly higher in dollar terms than it as last year, and this reflects the great buys our buyers have found. We feel very good about the values and the branded content we have in reserve, and this should help us deal our sales trend this year.\nJohn Kernan: Got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please proceed.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Appreciate the question, and great to see the improvement. Are there any particular categories that drove the upside that you delivered in the fourth quarter, and as the sales trends have continued into January and February, just any underlying shifts you\u2019re seeing in consumer behavior? Thanks, and then I have a quick follow-up. \nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Mark. Yes, in terms of categories, I would say for the fourth quarter as a whole, our footwear and our accessories businesses were our strongest performers. But I think it\u2019s important to call out that the improvement, the month-to-month sequential improvement that we saw through Q4 actually was fairly broad-based and happened across all of our major businesses. Everything got better, and I think that\u2019s mainly because--you know, when I go back and think about the key merchandising strategies that we really turned towards in the back half of last year, in particular the focus on value, we did that across all businesses, so that\u2019s why I think we saw the improvement across all businesses.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you. Then with respect to the store opening plans, a bit lower than you had signaled previously. How quickly do you think you can ramp new stores as availability increases, and are you seeing or hearing any indications that availability could increase more than you\u2019re currently expecting through 2023? Thank you. \nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Our real estate process is fairly rigorous. We have a very strong real estate team and we have, like I say, a fairly rigorous process for identifying and evaluating new store locations. We look at hundreds of potential sites to build up our pipeline for the year ahead, and as we look to the sites that are available to open in the next 12 months, we believe that there are 70 to 80 net new store locations that meet or beat our hurdles, and our hurdles in terms of being EBIT accretive and having a strong return on investment are pretty high. As I said in the remarks, that 70 to 70 net new stores is a little lower than we would like, but obviously we\u2019re not going to compromise our hurdles to hit a number. Ideally, we\u2019d like to open another 20 or 30, or even more if we had the locations, but I would say that\u2019s the outlook for the next 12 months. But with new store openings, it\u2019s important to look further out, and that\u2019s where we see significant opportunity.  As I mentioned in my remarks, we think that over the next few years, there could be a wave of retail consolidation among bricks and mortar retailers. That wave was kind of happening pre-pandemic and then I think in the last three years, it\u2019s been slightly dampened by the rollercoaster that\u2019s happened in terms of retailer sales and margins going up and then down. I think as things normalize, we may get back to additional retail consolidation. Now, the reason why I\u2019m focusing on retail consolidation, and I think most investors probably realize this, but for us, the biggest source of new store locations comes from other retailers closing stores. Many of our most productive locations were formerly Circuit City or Toys R Us or Sports Authority or Linens and Things; in other words, if there\u2019s an increase in retail bankruptcies, then that\u2019s going to drive real estate opportunities and new store opening opportunities for us.\nMark Altschwager: Thanks for all the color.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Please proceed.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Let me add my congratulations. It\u2019s great to see the progress. Michael, most of my questions have been asked, but I did notice a return to pretty aggressive prime time television in January and then February quarter-to-date. I\u2019m wondering what the advertising strategy is within the outlook for 2023, and clearly it seems like it is converting and driving traffic to the stores, so just a quick thought there. Then for Kristin on the reserve inventory, is that more short stay that can be deployed intra-season - Q1, Q2, or is that more long stay winter-to-winter? Thank you so much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Adrienne, on the marketing question, we\u2019re very excited about our marketing programs. In the last few years, I would say, we\u2019ve been moving to a much harder hitting value message with our advertising, and we think that that value message is going to really resonate in 2023. If we\u2019re right that the economy is going to slow down and that the consumer is going to be more value conscious, then I think our marketing is really going to speak to them and is really going to help to further enhance the traffic coming into our stores.  Now, I do think that the most important thing in our business is when the customer comes into the store, we can\u2019t disappoint them. We have to have the value in the store, and if you asked me last summer, I would have said I\u2019m less confident about that. As we move into 2023, I feel like what we have to offer in the store is much more compelling, and I think our marketing, if we\u2019re able to drive more traffic into the store, is really going to work well for us in 2023.\nKristin Wolfe: And then on your question on reserve inventory, as I noted, we feel really good about the values and the content in our reserve. It\u2019s certainly a mix of short stay and pack-and-hold, and we also measure it in terms of the percent of wow values and branded penetration, so we feel really good about the content of the reserve from all those measures.\nAdrienne Yih: Very helpful, thanks so much and best of luck.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed.\nChuck Grom: Hey, thanks very much. Great execution. My one question is on the buying team. I know you\u2019ve increased the organization a lot over the past few years, and I\u2019m curious if the team now is in a good place or are you still upgrading talent and new capabilities. As a follow-up, given there\u2019s a natural learning curve to adding so many new employees to the team, how should we think about the benefits of improved sales and profitability from that facet over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure, good morning Chuck. Thanks for the question. Yes, as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we\u2019ve really ramped up investment in our merchandising organization over the last three years. Just the raw numbers are that our headcount, our merchandising headcount is about 50% bigger now than it was in 2019. Now actually, if you peel back the onion on that, it\u2019s not 50% higher in every business. There are some businesses, especially our fastest growing opportunity businesses where the headcount growth was higher than 50%, and obviously some business where it\u2019s less, so that\u2019s a lot of newness, that\u2019s a lot of newness, a lot of investment in the organization. Now I should add that it\u2019s actually pretty consistent with what we had said three years ago. I think on a similar call like this three years ago, I probably would have said that we would have increased merchant headcount by about 15% a year for the next three years, and that\u2019s kind of the way it\u2019s worked out.  To just pivot to being forward-looking for a minute, I would say that most of the heavy lifting in terms of expanding our merchant team is now behind us. That\u2019s not to say that we won\u2019t add talent opportunistically - we will, and there\u2019s certainly some areas of our business where we see some opportunity for that, but the big increase, the big expansion has already happened.  Let me move away from headcount and just talk about how our merchandising organization operates, because I feel like in the last few years, we\u2019ve added headcount and we\u2019ve definitely leaned into the main principles of off-price more so than we ever had in the past. We\u2019re turning inventory much faster, we\u2019re chasing sales much more aggressively, we\u2019re controlling liquidity much more tightly, we\u2019re buying opportunistically - things that maybe we did historically but we\u2019re doing them to a much greater extent now. But I would say that we\u2019ve leaned into being off-price without necessarily having all the tools and the processes that our peers have, and we\u2019ve been addressing that over the past couple of years. We\u2019ve been developing a lot of those off-price tools, reports, capabilities, and we\u2019re rolling out many of those. We\u2019ve started rolling them out and over the next 12, 18 months, we\u2019ll roll more of them out, so I do think that there\u2019s a dividend that\u2019s yet to come in terms of the investment we\u2019ve made in merchandising. I feel like we should be able to drive sales growth and margin growth over the next two years. I\u2019m very confident that this strategic asset that we\u2019ve built in merchandising is going to pay dividends for us.\nChuck Grom: Michael, just as a quick follow-up, can you touch on the technology investments - I guess, what have you done and what\u2019s left, because I think that\u2019s a key part of the ingredient, being able to leverage the buying team that you\u2019ve added over the past couple of years.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, it\u2019s absolutely right, Chuck. When I joined Burlington, I was very nervous that I was going to walk in and find lots of antiquated systems at Burlington, and actually that wasn\u2019t the case. What I found was systems that were pretty up-to-date. What I did find, though, that those systems hadn\u2019t necessarily been configured with off-price in mind. They\u2019d been configured with a much more department store sort of pre-planned approach to buying. What we\u2019ve really done over the last three years is change how we configure those systems, but also that drives our planning processes and our buying processes and it drives the need for those systems to generate different reports, that look at different aspects of the business, so that\u2019s really the path we\u2019ve been on. Thankfully, as I say, we haven\u2019t had to sort of tear out the old systems and bring in new systems. It\u2019s been more about reconfiguring the systems that we have. Now obviously to do that right, you have to take a step back and you have to sort of say, well, let\u2019s understand our business needs, what are we trying to do, so there was a lot of user requirements, business requirements work that was required, but that\u2019s all behind us now. We\u2019re at the stage where we are actually rolling out new tools, new processes across the buying and planning organization.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Michael O\u2019Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We really look forward to talking to you again in May to discuss our first quarter fiscal results. Thank you for your time today. \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Michael and good morning everyone. Let me start with some additional financial details for the fourth quarter. Total sales in the quarter grew 5% while comp sales were down 2%. As Michael mentioned, our three-year geometric comp stack was a positive 4%. Comp sales and adjusted EPS came in above our guidance range. For Q4, our adjusted EPS was $2.96, which was above our guidance range of $2.45 to $2.75.  The gross margin rate was 40.7%, an increase of 90 basis points versus 2021's fourth quarter rate of 39.8%. This was driven by a 130 basis point improvement in freight expense but was partially offset by a 40 basis point decline in merchandise margin. The decline in merchandise margin was primarily driven by higher markdowns a we moved to sharpen our values, as Michael discussed earlier in the call.  Product sourcing costs were $187 million compared to $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, increasing 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs. We worked a higher mix of true close-out merchandise which is more labor intensive to process. In addition, the movement in and out of our reserve inventory to chase the trend was less efficient and drove higher supply chain expense. Adjusted SG&A was $593 million versus $578 million in 2021, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was driven by strong expense control and a lower bonus accrual.  Adjusted EBIT margin was 10%, 80 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Relative to our Q4 2019 adjusted EBIT margin, 2022's fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin declined by 340 basis points, driven entirely by supply chain and freight deleverage.  All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.83 versus $1.80 in Q4 of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.96 versus $2.53 in the fourth quarter of 2021.  At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 32% above 2021. As a reminder, last year as we came into the spring season, our store inventories were too lean and this hurt our sales trend in Q1, so the significant increase in our comparable store inventories was by design. I should also point out that this is still well below pre-pandemic levels.  At the end of the quarter, our reserve inventory was 48% of our total inventory versus 50% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values we have in reserve.  In the fourth quarter, we opened 34 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 927 stores. This included 39 new store openings, five relocations, and no closings. For the full year, we opened 113 new stores while relocating 22 stores and closing four stores, adding 87 net new stores to our fleet.  I will now move on to discuss our full year 2022 results.  Total sales decreased 7% and comp store sales decreased 13%. Our three-year geometric comp stack was flat. Our operating margin for the full year contracted by 370 basis points. Merchandise margin decreased by 110 basis points, freight de-levered by 10 basis points, product sourcing costs de-levered by 120 basis points, and adjusted SG&A de-levered by 110 basis points versus full year 2021.  Let's now move to 2023 guidance. For the 2023 fiscal year, we expect total sales growth in the range of 12% to 14%. This includes an approximately 2% impact related to the 53rd week. We expect comp store sales to increase in the range of 3% to 5% for fiscal 2023, and our adjusted EBIT margin to increase 80 to 120 basis points versus last year.  Capital expenditures net of landlord allowances is expected to be approximately $560 million. This results in adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.50 to $6, an expected increase of 29% to 41%. This outlook includes an adjusted EPS contribution of $0.05 from the 53rd week. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total sales growth in the range of 12% to 14%. Comp store sales are assumed to increase between 5% and 7%. We are expecting adjusted EBIT margins to increase in the range of 120 to 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2022, which results in an adjusted EPS outlook in the range of $0.85 to $0.95.  I will now turn the call back to Michael. Hi Matt, good morning. Thanks for the question.  You're right - for the full year 2023, we're guiding a 3% to 5% comp growth, 12% to 14% total sales growth that includes the 53rd week. On that 3% to 5% comp growth, as you said, we're modeling 80 to 120 basis points of operating margin expansion. This really comes from three main sources: higher merchandise margin, lower freight costs, and leverage on fixed expenses. Let me speak quickly to each of these items. On merchandise margin, given the extremely strong off-price environment, we believe we should be able to see some increase in merchandise margin; but as Michael said in the prepared remarks, our number one goal this year is to drive sales, and that will mean passing along values to our customers. So in other words, while we do expect an increase in merchandise margin, we're not intending to maximize this increase. Our intent is to prioritize sales comp growth. The second item I mentioned is the lower freight expenses. We're up against extraordinarily high freight costs from last year, particularly in the first part of the year, and we expect to see lower freight expenses especially in Q1 and Q2.  The third source of margin expansion is the leverage on store fixed expenses, like occupancy. Of course, some of this will depend on the level of comp sales, which is yet another reason why we're focused on the top line. There are also headwinds built into our 2023 guidance. These include limited or less improvement in supply chain given that increased mix of true close-out merchandise and also the resetting of incentive comp, assuming that we hit our plan.  For 2023, I'd like to stay away from specific line item guidance, and the reason is this year our overriding strategy is to drive sales. We recognize that means we need to be flexible, so depending on how the year unfolds, there may be times in the year we might want to sharpen our values to further drive sales, which could drive a slightly lower merchandise margin but greater leverage on fixed expenses. To recap, on the 3% to 5% comp growth, we expect to achieve 80 to 120 basis points of operating margin expansion. We believe this will come from three primary sources: merchandise margin, freight and leverage on store fixed expenses, but the contribution from each of these will really depend on how the retail and competitive environment unfolds this year. Good morning Jesse, thanks for the question.  Overall, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results, particularly the improvement in our comp store sales trend and that momentum that built during the quarter and continued into February. But as you noted, the flow-through on those incremental sales was not as strong as is typical for us, and that was primarily due to higher supply chain expenses. At a high level, our gross margin was pretty much where we expected as you look at the combination of 130 basis points of freight improvement more than offsetting slightly lower merchandise margins, which was driven by higher markdowns as we moved to sharpen values, as Michael noted. Product sourcing cost did de-lever somewhat more than we expected, which was primarily due to 60 basis points of supply chain de-leverage. Now on adjusted SG&A, that leverage - 50 basis points - and excluding the incentive comp adjustment, the adjusted SG&A rate would have been flat to the fourth quarter last year, which is still fairly strong expense control given the negative comp in the quarter. Good morning Lorraine, thanks for the question. I'd like to separate out two different factors that have contributed to higher supply chain costs at Burlington over the last few years. The first is there's a big piece of our higher supply chain costs that we should call externally driven, so over the last few years, there's been significant inflation in distribution center wage costs and then of course delays and volatility in global supply chains which have caused DC operations to be less efficient. This is not unique to Burlington. Other retailers, particularly those with lower average unit retails, have faced similar pressures, and we believe some of these higher costs, especially the higher wage rates, are likely here to stay; but we expect as global supply chain conditions continue to normalize, we should be able to drive some efficiencies and savings here. But the second factor on supply chain is really more specific to Burlington. Over the last few years, we've changed the mix of type of buy in our business. We now buy a much higher proportion of true off-price goods and this shift in that buy type mix in Q4 was even more extreme as we took advantage of fantastic opportunistic off-price buys. These deals, these buys are much more complex to process and have a higher work content in our DCs. We also heavily utilized reserve inventory in the quarter as we took advantage of opportunistic buys and to chase the trend, so those are the factors that drove up our supply chain expenses in Q4. As we look forward, we do expect to maintain a higher mix of true off-price merchandise than we have historically, though it may not be as extreme as it was in the fourth quarter. The final point to make here is we know we have opportunity in supply chain. We have work to do. Our distribution centers, the systems, the processes were not originally designed and really were never optimized with off-price in mind, so in the last few years, we're working hard to take actions to make our supply chain more flexible, more efficient and more off-price, but we have more work to do here, and there are some of these changes that are going to take time. Good morning John, thanks for the question. Yes, you're right - our comp store inventories were up 32% at the end of January, and as you noted and I think Michael responded to Jesse's question, last year we were under-inventoried at this time at the end of Q4. At the end of Q4 last year, we were down 30% versus 2019, and so when you adjust these numbers for compounding, this means our comparable store inventories are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Last year, the combination of conservative sales and inventory plans plus significant receipt disruptions and delays meant that our in-store inventories in February and March were well below where they needed to be, but by April they had recovered, but this situation undermined our sales in Q1 as Michael described earlier. This year, we deliberately increased inventory levels coming into the quarter - that's what's driving that 32% increase, and as we get into April, our comparable store inventories should be more in line with 2022, and as we move through the rest of this year, there may be variations by month but inventories will be similar to last year. That was store inventories, but let me shift quickly to talk about reserve inventories. A moment ago, Michael described how over the last couple of years, we've become more off-price in terms of the type of merchandise we buy, and a key enabler of this is how we use and expanded our reserve inventory. This provides us with the ability to take advantage of great opportunistic deals, even on merchandise that does not make sense to flow to stores right away. At the end of 2022, our reserve inventory was significantly higher in dollar terms than it as last year, and this reflects the great buys our buyers have found. We feel very good about the values and the branded content we have in reserve, and this should help us deal our sales trend this year. And then on your question on reserve inventory, as I noted, we feel really good about the values and the content in our reserve. It's certainly a mix of short stay and pack-and-hold, and we also measure it in terms of the percent of wow values and branded penetration, so we feel really good about the content of the reserve from all those measures."

            "content": "Thank you David. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our fourth quarter results; secondly, I will talk about our 2023 guidance; and finally, I'll offer some comments on our longer term outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our fourth quarter results and our 2023 guidance, then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let's talk about our Q4 results. Comp store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 2%. This was on top of 6% comparable store sales growth last year. As we have done on previous calls, today when we are describing our comp trend, we will use a three-year geometric stack. This metric is defined in more detail in today's press release. Our three-year geometric stack was positive 4% for the fourth quarter. As we shared on our Q3 call, our three-year geometric stack for November was flat to the prior year. As the quarter progressed, our sales trend improved sequentially. On a one-year basis and a three-year basis, our comp growth in both December and January was positive, with January stronger than December. We believe that there were two drivers of the improvement in our trend. Firstly, we took a number of actions in the back half of last year to sharpen our values. We described these in some detail on our November call, so this morning I am just going to summarize a couple of points. Number one, we backed off our original plan to raise prices. The consumer and promotional environment changed rapidly last year and it became clear that this was not the right time to be raising prices. Instead, in the fourth quarter we sharpened our values on fresh receipts and we aggressively used markdowns to drive faster turns on existing inventory. We focused especially heavily on expanding opening price points in our assortment. Number two, we significantly raised receipt plans and inventory levels in our strongest businesses and focused this open-to-buy on great opportunistic deals. The off-price supply environment was very strong in Q4 and we were able to take advantage of some incredible buys, especially on branded merchandise. We flowed many of these receipts to stores to fuel the stronger trend and we also tucked away some of these goods in reserve for later release.  These actions worked. Shoppers responded to our sharper values, expanded opening price points, and great branded buys. This led to a significant improvement in customer conversion and in average transaction size; in other words, shoppers liked the values that they found when they walked into our stores.  In Q4, we also saw an improvement in traffic. This points to the second driver of our stronger trend. We interpret this improvement in traffic as a sign that the macro headwinds may have started to abate. In particular, although inflation is still elevated, we are beginning to lap the significant spike that occurred in late 2021 into early 2022.  Let me move on now and talk about the outlook for the year ahead. As we said in November, we anticipate that in 2023, the economy will slow down and that inflation will continue to fall. We expect the inventory overhang across retail to diminish and this should lead to less promotional activity. If the external environment unfolds as I have just described, we believe that this could have three major implications for Burlington. First, the economic slowdown should create a greater consumer focus on value, potentially driving some trade-down activity from middle and higher income groups. Second, our value differentiation versus other retailers could grow as promotions moderate, and this should be a tailwind for traffic, conversion and transaction size. Third, we expect that the external expense environment will improve compared to last year. We are already seeing this start to happen with freight rates. There is one other factor that is important to call out, and this one is specific to Burlington. We executed poorly in 2022 and this hurt our trend. Once we corrected these mistakes late in the year, we saw an improvement. Obviously in 2023, we will be lapping these issues and we expect to drive stronger results.  These are the major reasons why we feel optimistic about 2023; but with all that being said, we recognize that there are some uncertainties and potential headwinds ahead. In particular, we remain concerned about the lower income customer, our core customer. In 2022, this customer group bore the brunt of the impact of inflation on real household incomes. We think the impact of inflation will moderate this year but there are other factors that could hurt this customer, such as a rise in unemployment and the ending of expanded SNAP benefits.  Putting all these factors together, we are guiding full year comp sales growth in the range of positive 3% to positive 5%. We believe that there may be upside to this range and we are managing our business to chase potential upside. Given this comp range, we expect to be able to drive 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion in 2023.  As we said in November, we believe we can get back to pre-pandemic margin levels within the next few years, but there are two reasons to be cautious on our 2023 margin. Firstly, our number one priority as we develop our budget and operating plans for 2023 was to drive sales. This means keeping our values as sharp as possible. Given the strong supply environment, we expect an increase in merchant margin, but this is balanced by the need to pass along great value to our customers to drive the trend.  The second reason to be cautious relates to expenses. As described earlier, we expect the external expense environment, specifically freight rates to improve in 2023, but it is difficult to predict how significant an impact this might have over the full year. Also, as Kristin will explain, in Q4 we incurred higher supply chain expenses as we pushed more aggressively into great opportunistic off-price buys. This merchandise drives sales and value, but it is typically more difficult and expensive to process. For the last couple of years, we have been taking actions to make our distribution centers more off-price and more efficient, but we still have work to do and this work will take time.  Let me sum up our 2023 guidance. We are planning and managing our business to support positive 3% to 5% comp growth, but we are ready to chase the trend if it is stronger. As for operating margin, we believe that we can get back to pre-pandemic operating margins within the next few years. For 2023, we are planning 80 to 120 basis points of expansion on 3% to 5% comp growth.  I would like to move on now and talk about our new store opening plans for 2023. We continue to be very pleased by the relative performance of our new stores, especially our new store format. In 2023, we are planning to open 90 to 100 gross new stores. After relocations and closures, this should yield 70 to 80 net new stores. This is lower than we would like and reflects the current lack of high quality real estate locations, as well as supply issues within the construction industry. That said, we believe that this situation could be about to change. Over the next couple of years, we think that there could be a wave of consolidation in bricks and mortar retail, and we anticipate that this could drive a significant increase in the number of high quality new store locations, so once we get through 2023, we believe that we can grow our new store program such that we will open 500 to 600 net new stores over the following five years. Before I hand over to Kristin, let me make some high level comments about the longer term outlook for Burlington. As I said earlier, we are optimistic about 2023, but looking further out we also see reasons to be bullish about the longer term. There are two factors in particular that I would like to highlight.  Firstly, we anticipate that the external environment for full price retail will remain difficult and uncertain over the next few years. We expect that many traditional retailers may struggle. This should drive strong off-price merchandise supply and, as I mentioned a moment ago, may lead to additional bricks and mortar retail consolidation. In this environment, we believe that off-price retailers have a major opportunity to take share.  Secondly, here at Burlington over the last two to three years, we have been busy investing in our business to transform ourselves into a stronger off-price retailer. For example, we have invested in our merchandising capabilities, we have made major changes in our stores organization to be more flexible and off-price, and we have changed our new store prototype to be more productive and efficient.  As I acknowledged in November, some of these initiatives are a work in process, but the overall strategic direction is clear: we are working to transform ourselves into a stronger off-price retailer, so as we look beyond 2023, we are very excited. We believe that the combination of these factors, firstly the potential dislocation and consolidation of traditional retail, and secondly the transformation of Burlington into a stronger off-price retailer could drive significant growth in sales, earnings and shareholder value over the next several years. I would now like to turn the call over to Kristin to provide more details on our Q4 results and our 2023 guidance. Thank you Kristin.  Before we move to questions, let me recap some of the key points that we have covered this morning. We saw a significant and sequential improvement in our sales trend in Q4. We believe that this was partly driven by better execution, specifically our focus on sharper value but also partly driven by an improvement in the external environment. We are optimistic about the outlook for 2023. We are planning and managing our business for positive 3% to 5% comp sales growth, but we are ready to chase if the trend is stronger. Our number one priority in 2023 is to drive sales. On 3% to 5% comp sales growth, we expect to achieve 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion.  Longer term beyond 2023, we are excited about the prospects for our business. We anticipate that the next few years will see significant disruption and dislocation across retail. We are pushing forward with the transformation of Burlington into a stronger off-price retailer, and this should help us to take advantage of the opportunities this disruption may present. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Good morning Matt. Thanks for the question. As we developed our 2023 comp guidance, I would say that there was three main reference points that we used. Firstly, we looked at our own multi-year comparisons. I won't drag you through all the numbers, but we looked at our business on a one-year, a two-year, a four-year basis and we then compared that data with the low single digit annual comp growth that we would historically have expected before the pandemic, so that was the first reference point. Secondly, we looked at our off-price peers. Our comp performance last year was significantly inferior to theirs. Now, we recognize that that may have been partially driven by differences in customer demographics, but we believe it was also driven by significant differences in execution. We know that we made mistakes last year and in 2023, we certainly don't intend to repeat those mistakes. Thirdly, the third reference point, if you like, is that we looked at our most recent trend. Our Q4 comp sales were 4% ahead of 2019 levels. Our 2023 comp guide implies that comp sales this year will be 3% to 5% ahead of 2019 levels; in other words, our guide is consistent with Q4.  One other data point that I would offer up, though, is that our quarter-to-date trend is running ahead of our Q1 guidance, and that trend gives us additional confidence in our comp guidance. Now, the various points of reference that I've just described suggest that our comp guidance for 2023 is achievable, but it's important to add that there are unknowns out there. There's a lot of economic uncertainty and we don't know how that uncertainty will play out in 2023. I think I've said before that setting comp guidance is not an exact science, but in our business that's okay. If we manage our business flexibly, then if the sales trend is stronger, we know that we can chase higher trend, so I guess I'd sum it up by saying we think our guidance is appropriate but we recognize there may be upside, and if there is, we're ready to chase it. Good morning Jesse. I think to answer that question, and as much as I hate to do this, let me start by describing the specific execution mistakes that contributed to our performance last year. If I was to share our internal post mortem, I would say that those mistakes fell into three main areas. Firstly, given the uncertain environment as we came into 2022, we deliberately planned inventory levels conservatively - this is a year ago, and those conservative inventory levels backfired on us. Like many other retailers certainly in the first quarter of last year and coming into the first quarter of last year, we experienced significant receipt volatility and delays, and those delays meant that we just ended up with too little on-hand inventory in our stores, and that really undermined our sales trend. The second thing I would say is in 2021, going back to 2021, we were reluctant to push up prices. Many other retailers at the time were talking about raising retails. We were reluctant to do that, but then as we came into 2022, I think we kind of questioned ourselves and said, well, maybe we're wrong, maybe we should start pushing up prices, so we added higher retails into our 2022 plans to really happen in the summer and into to back half of the year. Now in retrospect, with the impact of inflation on our core customer and with the higher promotional activity across retail, that was just not a good time to go raising prices. As we got into the full season, we realized that and we began to unwind those increases. Now, we should have done that sooner, but--anyway. It hurt our sales, especially in Q3, I would say.  Thirdly, in 2022 there was some huge shifts in the types of merchandise that the customer was interested in buying, and across our business, we didn't do a good enough job reacting and responding to those trends and those shifts.  Those were the three big buckets of mistakes that we think we made last year, and to answer your question on a tactical level, I would say yes, we believe those issues are behind us. We worked to correct the inventory and the receipt issues that we ran into last year, and we significantly sharpened our values and we shifted our assortment into the categories that we believe the customer is most interested in buying, and I think all of those changes paid off and really contributed to our stronger trend in the fourth quarter. I do want to just go a little bit further, though, in answering your question and just take a step back and maybe put those mistakes, if you like, in a bigger strategic context. I talked a little bit about this on our call in November. I think it's important to understand that over the last few years, we've been doing a lot to transform our business, in particular we've invested heavily to strengthen our merchandising capabilities. Since 2019, we've hired or promoted tremendous talent and we've developed and we're rolling out many, many new tools and processes for our merchants. Our buying team is now about 50% bigger in terms of headcount than it was in 2019. We know that merchandising is how you win in off-price, so we've assembled all the key ingredients - very experienced off-price merchant leadership, tremendous buying talent, improved buying and planning processes and new tools, training and reports. We've moved very fast - we had to, we're playing catch-up. Now, as they gel, those investments in my view are going to drive our growth and success over the next few years, but I have to acknowledge the mistakes we made in 2022 demonstrate that this is a work in process. I'm pleased that we corrected our mistakes and turned around our performance towards year-end, but we really need to be able to move faster and with greater consistency than we did last year. Good morning Lorraine. I would say that the availability of off-price merchandise has been very strong over the last five, six months, and I think we've heard that reported elsewhere as well. I would also say that I think our merchants have done a really good job leaning into that availability. We've made sure that we've controlled liquidity, so we've been able to take advantage of some really great deals. Now, it's not difficult to understand why the off-price buying environment has been so strong in that period. In early 2022, we started to see a surge in supply as transportation bottlenecks finally began to clear, and that surge in supply then coincided with a weakening in consumer demand across retail as the year went on. Not surprisingly, too much supply, too little demand equals off-price availability, and that's what's happened. But there are a couple other points that I'd like to make about merchandise supply. Firstly, as the third largest off-price retailer, this supply environment has given us the opportunity to open up new vendors and resources and to deepen relationships with existing vendors. We've worked very hard to partner with vendors to help them move excess inventory over the last few months. Our buyers have been very, very focused on that - we've been very responsive to vendors, and I think those new and expanded relationships are going to be very valuable to us strategically over the longer term. The second point to make is our expectation is that the buying environment is likely to remain fairly strong well into 2023, especially if the economy slows down and demand continues to soften. When you look at off-price availability over a longer time period, I think the real aberration is not how strong supply has been over the last six months. There have been plenty of times like this in the past. The real aberration is how constrained supply was between mid-2020 and early to mid 2022. Those constraints during that two-year period were driven by global supply chain issues coming out of the pandemic - we really hadn't seen those before. We think it's possible that the strong merchandise availability that we've seen over the last six months, it may just herald a return to normal. Yes, good morning John. That's a good question.  Once we get through 2023, we plan to provide an update on our long range financial plan, and that will include a multi-year forecast for operating margin. Frankly, for that update to have credibility, we have to get through 2023 first; but in the interim and to try and answer your question, let me offer up some comments to illustrate what kind of things might be in that plan and how are we thinking about operating margin. I'll start with the data. Our operating margin in 2022 was 430 basis points below our 2019 levels. You can break out that variance into four main components, four main buckets. Firstly, merchandise margin - now, merchandise margin in 2022 was actually about 50 basis points higher than it was in 2019, and that was driven by a higher mix of off-price merchandise and faster, much faster inventory turns. The environment in 2022, as we said, was very promotional, and that meant that we really had to sharpen our values, and that negatively impacted merchandise margin in 2022. In fact, not to confuse everyone, but although our merchant margin was up 50 basis points in 2022 versus 2019, it actually fell by about 110 basis points versus 2021. We look at that set of numbers and we think there's upside to margin over the next couple of years, and we believe we have an opportunity to get back closer to the 2021 levels.  Now that said, and Kristin emphasized this point, in the near term we want to be very careful about how aggressively we go after that. As we've said on this call, our priority in 2023 is really to drive sales rather than to maximize margin. Anyway, that's the first sort of driver of variance versus 2019. The second driver of margin variance in 2022 versus 2019 was higher freight expense. Those expenses were 180 basis points higher than 2019, and the lion's share of that increase was driven by external freight rates. Now, we expect to recover a significant proportion of that deleverage as freight rates normalize in the next couple of years, and as we mentioned earlier, we're starting to see some of that. The third source of variance is higher supply chain expenses. Again, in 2022 versus 2019, those were 230 basis points worse. As global supply chains begin to normalize, we fully expect that the timing of receipt flows will become more predictable and more reliable, and we believe that as slowing economy may dampen labor costs and turnover in our distribution centers, and those two factors could drive some savings in supply chain expenses but we're being a little cautious there, because as Kristin said a moment ago, some of the higher costs versus 2019, we believe have been driven by the shift in our business to becoming more off-price, and it's going to take a bit longer to address those costs. The fourth source of operating margin variance since 2019, I'm going to call all other expenses. Now, all other expenses de-levered by about 70 basis points in 2022 versus 2019. That bucket includes some areas of the business where we've actually driven greater efficiency, but those savings have been more than offset by deleverage on fixed expenses, especially fixed store expenses like occupancy. That deleverage is not a surprise, it's the result of a flat comp, essentially flat comp sales over a three-year period, so that's another reason why our priority in 2023 is to drive the top line. The more we can drive sales, the more leverage we can see on those fixed expenses. I guess to bring my answer back to one place, I guess our path back to 2019 margins is likely to have four main components: number one, a focus on higher sales, especially in 2023, higher sales drive leverage; number two, lower freight expenses as external rates normalize in the next couple of years, and we're starting to see that happen; number three, higher merchant margin as the highly promotional environment of last year begins to recede; number four, supply chain efficiencies but, for the reasons we've outlined, some of those may take a little bit of time. Let me sort of finish up with just one final point. The question you asked was how will we get back to 2019 margins. Now, we feel good about the levers I've just outlined, but we don't regard 2019 margins as our final destination. We still believe that we can drive operating margin beyond 2019 levels. The key premise of Burlington 2.0 is that we can drive stronger sales productivity with lower inventory levels and in a smaller store format. By doing all those things, we believe we can drive our operating margin above historic levels and thereby start to close the gap versus our off-price peers. Good morning Mark. Yes, in terms of categories, I would say for the fourth quarter as a whole, our footwear and our accessories businesses were our strongest performers. But I think it's important to call out that the improvement, the month-to-month sequential improvement that we saw through Q4 actually was fairly broad-based and happened across all of our major businesses. Everything got better, and I think that's mainly because--you know, when I go back and think about the key merchandising strategies that we really turned towards in the back half of last year, in particular the focus on value, we did that across all businesses, so that's why I think we saw the improvement across all businesses. Sure. Our real estate process is fairly rigorous. We have a very strong real estate team and we have, like I say, a fairly rigorous process for identifying and evaluating new store locations. We look at hundreds of potential sites to build up our pipeline for the year ahead, and as we look to the sites that are available to open in the next 12 months, we believe that there are 70 to 80 net new store locations that meet or beat our hurdles, and our hurdles in terms of being EBIT accretive and having a strong return on investment are pretty high. As I said in the remarks, that 70 to 70 net new stores is a little lower than we would like, but obviously we're not going to compromise our hurdles to hit a number. Ideally, we'd like to open another 20 or 30, or even more if we had the locations, but I would say that's the outlook for the next 12 months. But with new store openings, it's important to look further out, and that's where we see significant opportunity.  As I mentioned in my remarks, we think that over the next few years, there could be a wave of retail consolidation among bricks and mortar retailers. That wave was kind of happening pre-pandemic and then I think in the last three years, it's been slightly dampened by the rollercoaster that's happened in terms of retailer sales and margins going up and then down. I think as things normalize, we may get back to additional retail consolidation. Now, the reason why I'm focusing on retail consolidation, and I think most investors probably realize this, but for us, the biggest source of new store locations comes from other retailers closing stores. Many of our most productive locations were formerly Circuit City or Toys R Us or Sports Authority or Linens and Things; in other words, if there's an increase in retail bankruptcies, then that's going to drive real estate opportunities and new store opening opportunities for us. Thank you. Adrienne, on the marketing question, we're very excited about our marketing programs. In the last few years, I would say, we've been moving to a much harder hitting value message with our advertising, and we think that that value message is going to really resonate in 2023. If we're right that the economy is going to slow down and that the consumer is going to be more value conscious, then I think our marketing is really going to speak to them and is really going to help to further enhance the traffic coming into our stores.  Now, I do think that the most important thing in our business is when the customer comes into the store, we can't disappoint them. We have to have the value in the store, and if you asked me last summer, I would have said I'm less confident about that. As we move into 2023, I feel like what we have to offer in the store is much more compelling, and I think our marketing, if we're able to drive more traffic into the store, is really going to work well for us in 2023. Sure, good morning Chuck. Thanks for the question. Yes, as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we've really ramped up investment in our merchandising organization over the last three years. Just the raw numbers are that our headcount, our merchandising headcount is about 50% bigger now than it was in 2019. Now actually, if you peel back the onion on that, it's not 50% higher in every business. There are some businesses, especially our fastest growing opportunity businesses where the headcount growth was higher than 50%, and obviously some business where it's less, so that's a lot of newness, that's a lot of newness, a lot of investment in the organization. Now I should add that it's actually pretty consistent with what we had said three years ago. I think on a similar call like this three years ago, I probably would have said that we would have increased merchant headcount by about 15% a year for the next three years, and that's kind of the way it's worked out.  To just pivot to being forward-looking for a minute, I would say that most of the heavy lifting in terms of expanding our merchant team is now behind us. That's not to say that we won't add talent opportunistically - we will, and there's certainly some areas of our business where we see some opportunity for that, but the big increase, the big expansion has already happened.  Let me move away from headcount and just talk about how our merchandising organization operates, because I feel like in the last few years, we've added headcount and we've definitely leaned into the main principles of off-price more so than we ever had in the past. We're turning inventory much faster, we're chasing sales much more aggressively, we're controlling liquidity much more tightly, we're buying opportunistically - things that maybe we did historically but we're doing them to a much greater extent now. But I would say that we've leaned into being off-price without necessarily having all the tools and the processes that our peers have, and we've been addressing that over the past couple of years. We've been developing a lot of those off-price tools, reports, capabilities, and we're rolling out many of those. We've started rolling them out and over the next 12, 18 months, we'll roll more of them out, so I do think that there's a dividend that's yet to come in terms of the investment we've made in merchandising. I feel like we should be able to drive sales growth and margin growth over the next two years. I'm very confident that this strategic asset that we've built in merchandising is going to pay dividends for us. Yes, it's absolutely right, Chuck. When I joined Burlington, I was very nervous that I was going to walk in and find lots of antiquated systems at Burlington, and actually that wasn't the case. What I found was systems that were pretty up-to-date. What I did find, though, that those systems hadn't necessarily been configured with off-price in mind. They'd been configured with a much more department store sort of pre-planned approach to buying. What we've really done over the last three years is change how we configure those systems, but also that drives our planning processes and our buying processes and it drives the need for those systems to generate different reports, that look at different aspects of the business, so that's really the path we've been on. Thankfully, as I say, we haven't had to sort of tear out the old systems and bring in new systems. It's been more about reconfiguring the systems that we have. Now obviously to do that right, you have to take a step back and you have to sort of say, well, let's understand our business needs, what are we trying to do, so there was a lot of user requirements, business requirements work that was required, but that's all behind us now. We're at the stage where we are actually rolling out new tools, new processes across the buying and planning organization. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We really look forward to talking to you again in May to discuss our first quarter fiscal results. Thank you for your time today."

After the speaker\u2019s presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to David Glick, Group Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead Mr. Glick.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's conference call to discuss Burlington's fiscal 2022 third quarter operating results.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover four topics this morning; firstly, I will discuss our third quarter results; secondly, I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter; thirdly, I will talk about our 2023 outlook; and finally, I'll offer some comments on the longer term. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let's talk about our results. Comp store sales for the third quarter decreased 17%. This was on top of 16% comparable store sales growth last year. As we have done on previous calls, today, when we are describing our comp trend, we will use a three-year geometric stack. This metric is defined in more detail in today's press release. Our three-year geometric stack was minus 3% for the third quarter. This was within our guidance range but still a disappointing result. There were external headwinds that contributed to this comp performance. These headwinds are real and have affected our business all year but today, I do not plan to spend much time talking about these. As we said on our August call, despite these headwinds, as an off-price retailer, we should be able to drive stronger performance than this. If you look at the results reported this past week, clearly, we are an outlier within off-price. Again, this mirrors my comments from August, so I would like to spend some time talking about the actions that we have taken since then. In off-price, the most important driver of sales is the value that we put in front of the customer. In August, I explained that we were aggressively reviewing the value and the mix in our assortment. There were numerous actions that came out of that review. Let me share some details on these. Number one, we had originally planned to raise retail prices and increased merchant margin in the back half of the year. In Q3, we pulled back on this. We reviewed our on order and we adjusted retail to sharpen the values on fresh receipts that flowed to stores in September and October. Number two, we also went through our existing inventory and went after slower-moving merchandise with more aggressive markdowns. By end of September, we have rolled these markdowns through all areas of the store, and we took further aggressive markdowns in October. Number three, we raised liquidity in faster-moving businesses and focused this open to buy on great opportunistic deals. These buys began to show up in stores in early October. Number four, we used the liquidity that I just mentioned to drive up the mix of recognizable brands in our assortment. By mid-October, we achieved a much higher mix of these key brands in front of the customer compared to last year. Number five, in addition, we focused very heavily on expanding our mix of opening price points across our businesses. We know that we have many need-a-deal customers for whom these lower price points are very important. And number six, we accelerated releases of great values from reserve inventory. We pulled these releases forward from Q4 to Q3 and grew down reserve inventory from 52% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter to 31% of total inventory at the end of the third quarter. During this period, we tightened and controlled expenses, but we reinvested these savings in the actions I have just described. Since early September, we have done a lot to sharpen our values, but as I acknowledged back in August, we should have done all of this sooner. In 2022, the consumers' frame of reference for value shifted significantly versus last year. We should have responded more aggressively and more rapidly. With that said, let me talk now about the results we have seen from the actions we have taken. The main headline is that since mid-October, we have seen a pickup in our sales trend that has continued into November month to date. This is a short period of time, and of course, there are many important shopping days ahead of us. But we believe that this improvement is attributable to the actions we have taken, and this pickup gives us some optimism going into Q4. In fact, let me move on to talk about Q4 guidance. Although we have made significant adjustments to sharpen our values and we have seen a pickup in our sales trends, we are maintaining the guidance for Q4 that we previewed on our August earnings call. We are mindful of the fact and 2022 has demonstrated that we are more exposed to some of the prevailing macro headwinds than many other retailers. These headwinds have not gone away. For these reasons, we are staying with the guidance that we issued in August. As a reminder, this guidance is based on a three-year geometric stack of minus 4% to minus 1%. We hope to do better, but we think it is prudent to maintain this guidance. Now I would like to talk about how we are thinking about 2023 and our longer-term outlook. We previewed this on our call in August. As a reminder, coming into 2022, we were concerned about the headwinds and risks across retail, and it turns out that we were right. In contrast, we are optimistic about the outlook for 2023. This optimism is based on five factors. Firstly, we expect that the economy will continue to slow down. And as it does, we anticipate that there will be an even stronger consumer focus on value. Secondly, throughout 2022, there has been a huge imbalance between supply and demand with too much inventory across retail. This has driven much higher promotional activity, especially in mass channels. Put simply, in 2023, we expect a lower level of promotional activity, and this should help to recover our sales trend. Thirdly, there is a very strong availability of great off-price merchandise. This has also been reported by our peers. By year-end, we think it is likely that we will have rebuilt our reserve inventory with great opportunistic buys. We also expect that the availability of great in-season merchandise will remain strong well into 2023. Fourthly, we have made mistakes this year that has hurt our sales trend. I realize we have to demonstrate this, but we do not intend to repeat these mistakes in 2023. Finally, we believe that the expense environment in 2023 is likely to improve very significantly versus this year, especially for contracted transportation rates. Those are the reasons why we were optimistic about 2023. In terms of risks, the main call out is a continuing concern about the lower-income customer. As we have discussed before, we have more exposure to this customer than most other retailers. In 2022, the lower-income shopper has borne the brunt of the impact of inflation. As we look forward to 2023, we do not expect that this headwind will disappear, but we think that it should moderate if the level of inflation continues to fall. To sum up on 2023. We have to get through Q4, and we need to complete our budget process before we can offer guidance. But given what we know at this point, we are optimistic about the potential to drive some recovery in sales and margin next year. I'm going to finish up with some comments about the outlook beyond 2023. We remain very excited about the ability of off-price to continue to take market share over time. We also remain confident in our ability to improve our execution of the off-price model and thereby, drive higher sales and margins. I realize that there are investors listening to this call who are thinking, well, that all sounds great, but given your results this year, why should we be confident in this longer-term outlook? Let me address that question. I'll start by saying that we do not believe that any of the issues we have faced this year have been what you might call, structural. For example, there's been no issue with getting access to great supply and great brands. In fact, I can't recall a time when off-price supply has been better. Rather than a structural root cause, I think there have been two key drivers about poor performance this year. Firstly, the macro headwinds have been real, especially the impact of inflation on the lower-income customer. This has hurt us more than most other retailers. But this is not a permanent structural change, rather it is temporary and driven by the economic cycle. This impact will recede over time. I would describe the second key driver of our poor performance as being developmental. In the last few years, we have been transitioning to become more off-price. For example, we have been investing in our buying capabilities. By the end of this year, our buying team will be almost 50% larger than it was in 2019. It is important to note that much of this investment is now behind us. This pace of growth has already naturally slowed. The focus going forward will be on how to take greater advantage of this improved buying capability to drive sales and margin growth. So to sum up, we are excited about the prospects for off-price and despite our disappointing performance this year, we are confident in our ability to drive improved execution and significant sales and margin recovery over the next few years. I would now like to turn the call over to Kristin to provide more details on our Q3 results and our rest of year guidance.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me start with some additional financial details for the third quarter. Total sales in the quarter were down 11%, while comp sales were down 17%. As Michael mentioned, our three-year geometric comp stack was a negative 3%. Comp sales and adjusted EPS came within our guidance range. For Q3, our adjusted EPS was $0.43, which was within our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.66. The gross margin rate was 41.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2021's third quarter rate of 41.4%. This was driven by a 90 basis point decline in merchandise margin, which was partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in freight expense. The decline in merchandise margin was driven by the more aggressive markdowns that Michael referenced in order to sharpen our values. Product sourcing costs were $178 million compared to $173 million in the third quarter of 2021, increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was driven by buying and supply chain costs. Buying costs deleveraged on the 17% comp decline, while supply chain costs were higher than expected, primarily due to a pull forward of Q4 receipts and the higher mix of true closeout merchandise, which is more labor-intensive to process. Adjusted SG&A was $544 million versus $582 million in 2021, increasing 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was driven by the overall deleverage on the sales comp decline. Adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter was 2.7%, 340 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2021. Given where our comp store sales actualized within our guidance range, this margin decline is what we would have expected given our Q3 EBIT margin guidance for a decline of 260 to 360 basis points. Relative to our Q3 2019 adjusted EBIT margin, 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT margin declined by 520 basis points. Of this, 360 basis points is driven by supply chain and freight, with the balance driven by the deleverage on the lower comp sales. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.26 versus $0.20 in Q3 of 2021. As a reminder, the prior year's amount included a $1.22 per share impact from a loss on debt extinguishment charges. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.43 versus $1.36 in the third quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were 8% above 2021 on a comp store basis, and our reserve inventory was 31% of our total inventory versus 30% last year. As Michael discussed, we aggressively flowed reserve inventory to stores during the month of October in order to be properly set with great values for the critical holiday selling season. In the third quarter, we opened 16 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 893 stores. This included 28 new store openings, 10 relocations, and two closings. In the fourth quarter, we plan to open an additional 39 new stores and to relocate five stores. As a result, we should end the year with 927 stores, this translates to 87 net new store openings this year. Now let me turn to our outlook for Q4. As Michael mentioned, we are maintaining our outlook for the fourth quarter, which is based on a negative 4% to negative 1% three-year geometric comp stack. This translates to a one-year comp decline of 9% to 6%. This range should lead to a Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of flat to up 70 basis points versus 2021 and to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $2.45 and to $2.75. For the full year fiscal 2022, this implies a one-year comp range of negative 15% to negative 14%. Based on this range, our adjusted EBIT margin is expected to decline by 400 to 370 basis points. Given our actual third quarter results and Q4 guidance, this translates to an updated adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2022 of $3.77 to $4.07. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed. In August, we took a step back to challenge and reset the values and mix in our assortment. We made significant changes. We believe that these drove the improvement in our trend towards the end of the quarter. Despite these changes and the improvement in the trend, we are cautious. 2022 has shown that we are more exposed to the prevailing macro headwinds than many other retailers. So despite the recent improvement, we are maintaining our previously issued guidance for Q4. Looking ahead to 2023, there are several reasons why we are optimistic about the outlook. We need to get through Q4 before we offer guidance, but we believe we should be able to drive some recovery in sales and margin in 2023. Lastly, as we look further out, we remain confident in the prospects for the off-price model and in our ability to drive improved execution of that model over time. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks. So Michael, maybe to dig further in on the long-term, so clearly, 2022 has not gone according to plan, and there's been a pretty major setback in terms of financial performance. So how best to think about your ability to get back on track and the potential and timing to achieve some of the longer-term financial targets that you laid out last year?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning Matt. Thanks for the question. I think that the way that you phrased it is exactly right. 2022 has been a major setback in terms of hitting our longer-term financial targets. But let me explain why I believe that we can get back on track and what we need to do to get there. Firstly, the reason why I believe we can get back on track is because nothing fundamental or structural has changed. That's kind of what I was getting at in the prepared remarks. There really been two key drivers of our performance this year. Firstly, macro headwinds, which have been significant, but I don't see those as being permanent. They're just part of the economic cycle. And secondly, our own mistakes, driven by poor execution. So the long-term opportunity, in my view, has not changed but let me talk about what we need to do to get back on track as we go after that opportunity. The number one, the number one priority is sales. We have to drive sales. The only way to do that in our business is to continue to improve our ability to deliver value to the customer. I realize 2022 has not been a good averment for our ability to do that, but we'll learn from the mistakes that we've made this year. The other aspect of getting back on track to our longer-term financial targets is to drive earnings as well as sales. If you look at the deleverage in our operating margin this year versus 2019, it comes from two sources; expense deleverage on lower sales and higher freight and supply chain costs. As I just said, our number one priority as we get into 2023 and beyond is to drive sales. If we can do that, then we can drive leverage. But we're also very focused on driving down freight and supply chain expenses as rates and as external conditions start to normalize. It's too early to put a more specific time frame on it, but I believe that we can get back to our 2019 margins within the next few years. In addition, as we've talked about before, there are longer-term initiatives that should help us to deliver an even stronger margin over time for example, the rollout of our smaller, more profitable new store prototype. I guess, let me finish up by saying, we've deliberately not provided a formal update to the longer-term financial model that we shared last year. I'm still very confident in our ability to achieve those longer-term financial targets but frankly, for an update to that model to have any credibility, we have to get through 2023 first. We really have to demonstrate improved performance and execution.\nMatthew Boss: Great, and then maybe a follow-up on new store openings. So it looks like you're on track to open 87 net new stores this year. That's a bit shy of your original target of 90. Could you just provide any additional color on that and should we interpret this as a slowdown?\nMichael O'Sullivan: It's a good question, you're right. We had originally planned to open 90 net new stores this year, but we're now expecting to open 87. But the short answer to your question is that there were some supply chain delays with air conditioning equipment and other stuff like that. So a small number of stores slipped. Those -- that small number of stores will open in the spring. So we now expect to end this year with 927 stores. As a reminder, our long-term target is 2,000 stores, that has not changed. Also, as we've announced previously, we expect to open between 500 and 600 net new stores over the next five years over that entire period. The only update is that the actual number may vary slightly more year by year. The reason I'm calling that out is that we expect that there will be some bricks-and-mortar retail consolidation over the next few years. That could have a very positive impact on the quality and availability of real estate locations but it's hard to predict what that looks like year-over-year. And that means that the number of openings could be higher or lower in one year versus the next. So bottom line, the overall target has not changed, but the number of openings in any specific year might vary more depending on the availability of locations.\nMatthew Boss: Great color, best of luck.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nIrwin Boruchow: Hey, good morning Michael, Kristin, David. I guess, Michael, first question for you, I wanted to focus on inventory levels. Any chance you could provide maybe some additional detail on inventory levels on where you ended Q3 and where you expect these to be at year-end? And then maybe also, it sounds like the off-price volume environment is very attractive. Does this mean there might be some merch margin upside in 4Q as you flow more recent buys in the stores? And then a follow-up for Kristin.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning Ike. I think the best thing to do is separate out our store inventory from our reserve inventory. Our store inventory is obviously what's available for sale to customers in our stores, reserve inventory is obviously goods that we've packed away for later release. At the end of Q3, our store inventory was up 8% on a comp store basis. We actually expect to drive that inventory level even higher in the run-up to holiday. The reason for that, and you'll remember this, last year, we suffered significant receipt delays which created holes in our assortment during this critical selling period. And as we lap that impact, obviously, our store inventory is going to be higher year-over-year. Similarly, at year-end, I would anticipate that we would have much higher store inventory levels than last year. Last year, our store inventories were just too lean going into the spring. And again, you'll remember that, that together with receipt delays really undermined our sales trend in February and March. So our plan is to start the spring season with much higher store inventory level than we did last year. Let me move on though and talk about reserve inventory. In Q3, we released a lot of receipts out of reserve to build up our store inventory levels as we enter Q4. Now it's going to depend on the opportunities that our buyers find in the market but I would expect that by year-end, we will have built back up our reserve inventory. But again, that will depend on opportunities. On the last part of your question, yes, the off-price buying environment right now is very attractive. There are a lot of great deals. And ordinarily, I would agree that, that should drive merchant margin upside but I think that, that's unlikely to happen in Q4. As I described in my prepared remarks, our overriding focus in this environment is to offer great value in order to drive the sales trend, and that means that we'll be passing along great deals to our shoppers.\nIrwin Boruchow: Got it. And then, Kristin, maybe can you give us a little bit more color on the 4Q guide from a margin perspective, I think -- so you're calling for flat to up slightly EBIT margin, given the significant decline in the third quarter, can you just walk us through the big drivers of the improvement that you're kind of embedding for the holiday?\nKristin Wolfe: Sure Ike, thanks for the question. So first and foremost, our three-year comp stack is similar to what we guided to in Q3, the one year is actually several hundred basis points better, given that last year, our Q3 comp was a plus 16% and then Q4 moderated to plus 6%. And while we are maintaining that Q4 guidance, as Michael mentioned, since mid-October we've seen a pickup in the sales trend. And despite a warm start to November, our month-to-date sales trend is slightly above the high end of our guidance range. So this gives us confidence in that guidance. So given the improved one-year comps for the fourth quarter, expense deleverage moderates somewhat on each line in the P&L, particularly in SG&A. And then coming down to gross margin, we expect to see favorability or leverage and freight expense, given the dynamics of what's happening in transportation costs, that headwind is moderating. As a reminder, last year, those were peak import freight costs in Q4 so we're lapping that, and those factors should help us drive a modest increase in reported gross margin. And then we do expect to see less deleverage in product sourcing costs, including supply chain costs given the acceleration of Q4 receipts into Q3 that Michael mentioned as well as we're lapping onetime incentives and hiring expenses in our distributions from last year. And with regard to supply chain, we've put in place several initiatives to continue to drive productivity. We're investing in automation and efficiencies opportunities in the DCs, so continuing there. So overall, given these puts and takes and factors we expect fourth quarter EBIT margin, as you said, to be flattish to slightly above Q4 2021.\nIrwin Boruchow: Great, thanks. Happy holidays everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks, good morning. Michael, the merchandising organization has been a strategic priority for you. Can you describe the investment you've made in this capability since 2019 and how this investment might drive the sales and margin objectives over time?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning Lorraine, thank you for the question. Yes, we've been growing our merchant team for the last few years. As you say, this has been a major priority for us. We know that merchandising capability is how you win in off-price. We have recognized since the start that we are well behind our competitors in this regard. We've been playing catch-up with these capabilities. I would say our peers built their buying organizations over many years, and we're trying to do it in a much more compressed period of time. As I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of this year, we will have grown our buying team by almost 50% versus 2019, this is huge. I'm pleased with this growth. And more importantly, I'm very pleased with the quality of the talent that we've been able to attract. But of course, this kind of growth takes a while to absorb and integrate. It will take time for this team to become as effective as it can be as effective as it needs to be. Between 2021 and 2022, as I said in the script, there's been a huge shift in the consumer's frame of reference for value. With all the newness that I just described, we didn't respond to that shift as rapidly or as aggressively as we should have. That's disappointing, but probably not surprising. I think it reflects our stage of development. But let me sort of look further -- let me look ahead. I think that it's important to note that the major growth spurt in merchandising capability is now behind us. We'll continue to add where we need to or opportunistically where we see really great talent. But we're not going to be adding merchant headcount if anything like the same pace as we have over the last three years. The focus going forward is going to be to drive greater efficiency and value from the investment that we've already made. Just to bring this to life a little bit more compared with 2019, we now have much greater off-price merchant expertise, more experienced leadership, stronger vendor coverage, and much greater buying resources especially targeting our highest opportunity growth businesses. So I feel like we've built a huge asset and I've got no doubt that this asset is going to drive significant growth in sales and earnings over the next few years.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks and then for Kristin, can you walk us through the puts and takes on your margins in Q3, supply chain costs were a little higher than we had expected, so can you help us understand why they're still elevated and then what the path to recapturing at least a portion of the supply chain deleverage looks like?\nKristin Wolfe: Sure. Lorraine, thanks for the question. I'll walk through the puts and takes on Q3. From a gross margin standpoint, we came in about where we expected. Merchandise margin was down 90 basis points and freight lower by 70 basis points, came in largely in line with what we were expecting. SG&A did come in lower than we had planned due to strong expense control, but as you have noted, we did incur higher-than-expected supply chain costs. These were offset in the context of our guidance with that lower SG&A, but it was higher. So let me walk you through the key factors on supply chain. It's a bit of a good news, bad news story. The good news is we were able to accelerate releases of great values from reserve. Michael mentioned it in his prepared remarks, but I think it bears repeating, reserve inventory went from 52% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter and then down to 31% of total inventory at the third quarter. The other good news is that we were able to secure a more highly desirable branded closeout buys. These buys are typically messier, they're more labor-intensive, less efficient to work through the distribution centers. So those are sort of the good news items. The bad news, of course, is that all these drove higher supply chain expenses. But as I mentioned with Ike's question, we should see improvement in the fourth quarter, again, with that receipt pull forward, lapping the higher incentives, but also with the productivity and automation initiatives were continuing, which will continue into 2023.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning Michael, Kristin, and David. Michael, I have a question about the low-income customer. Clearly, this customer has been under inflationary pressures this year. How long do you think it will take before their spending levels begin to recover and until that happens, do you think it's going to be difficult to drive your historical levels of comps and sales? Then I have a quick follow-up for Kristin.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning John. When we look at our core customer demographics, we index as much lower income, much more ethnic, younger, and larger family size than most other retailers. These are, I think, the very consumers that have been disproportionately hurt by the higher cost of living this year. And like other income groups, these demographics don't have savings to draw from. But I could say, we love this customer. These shoppers have driven the growth of bricks-and-mortar value retail over many years. It may take a while, but this customer is going to recover and over the long term, it's a very attractive and growing customer base. As we look forward to 2023, we anticipate that this low-income customer will continue to be pressured economically. Our optimism around 2023 is not predicated on a sudden bounce back by this customer group. We think that constrained spending levels by lower-income customers will still be a headwind for us in 2023, but just less of a headwind than it was in 2022. So our optimism about 2023 is driven by other factors, specifically, a greater focus on value by other income groups and therefore, more trade down traffic; less of an inventory overhang and therefore, lower promotions, especially in mass retail; an improving expense environment, especially for contracted freight; and lastly, of course, better execution by us as we lap our own mistakes from this year.\nJohn Kernan: Maybe just a final question here for Kristin or David, can you give us some color on your cash levels and free cash flow, how might the cash flow profile impact your ability to continue share repurchases given the cash balances moderated year-over-year?\nDavid Glick: This is David. Good morning John, I'll take the one. Thanks for the question. Just as a reminder, our approach to our capital structure is to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet to fund our growth. We want to have adequate liquidity to manage through different economic scenarios and of course, we want to deploy excess cash in the most accretive way possible for our shareholders. Now 2022 was a really unusual year from a cash flow perspective, particularly as it related to working capital. That was a substantial use of cash. Why, we really rebuilt our inventory levels, especially our reserve inventory, which we've talked about on this call. In addition, we continue to invest in our growth with over $500 million in forecasted CAPEX this year. And we still repurchased stock, having bought back approximately $250 million in shares year-to-date, and we also paid down about $65 million of debt earlier this year. So as a result of the actions that I just walked you through, in addition to lower EBITDA levels, our excess cash balance has certainly moderated from 2021 levels. That said, if you look at our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $1.3 billion in liquidity, including $429 million in cash, which we would expect to build seasonally as we go through Q4. But given the challenging operating environment, we would expect a more modest pace of buybacks going forward, perhaps more similar to our activity that you saw in Q3. But we're going to remain flexible in our approach and react to the environment appropriately. The outlook remains very uncertain, and we want to take a prudent approach to how we manage our balance sheet. But as we look forward to 2023 from a cash flow perspective, it is important to recognize that we do not expect working capital to be the drag that it was in 2022. As Michael talked about earlier in his prepared remarks, we are optimistic that EBITDA can begin to recover in 2023 so we should be able to generate sufficient free cash flow to not only support the growth of our business and maintain adequate liquidity, but return excess cash to shareholders probably at a similar pace as we did in Q3. And how we deploy that excess cash, that's always a function of what we view as the most accretive avenue for our shareholders. Now all of this depends on our results and of course, the environment we're operating in. But at a high level, that's how we're thinking about our cash flow.\nJohn Kernan: Great, Happy Thanksgiving, and best of luck.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you John. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Stratton from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlexandra Straton: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This one is probably best for Michael. Wondering if we've seen across off-price this year, is that the price gap to the full price channel has certainly compressed given the significant promotions and discounting. But now that players like Walmart and Target seem more clean on apparel inventory, perhaps that's an opportunity for next year and even into the fourth quarter. But I guess, at the same time, some of the more specialty retailers continue to have high inventories heading into the fourth quarter. So there's obviously some puts and takes. I'm just wondering how do you think about that value gap dynamic as it relates to Burlington in both the fourth quarter and then into next year? Thanks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yeah, good morning Alex. Yes, I think the way that you have described it in terms of the value gap, that's something we watch very closely. I would say looking back over this year, I think our value differentiation, I mean we -- what drives our sales is when we offer great value compared with other retailers. I would say our value differentiation got very compressed in Q2 into early Q3. And that was driven by significant promotional activity and we didn't respond to it soon enough. And I feel like the -- a big part of the pivot that we made in late August was to take actions to restore that value differentiation by doing all the things I described in the prepared remarks. So as we go into Q4, we feel better about our value differentiation versus other retailers. But I guess two things, one is, it's not a one-and-done exercise. I think we need to continue, and there's much more I think we can do to drive even better in front of the customer. So our merchants, our planners, our operators are very, very focused on those additional steps we can take. And then secondly, I would say that I agree with your point, it seems like inventory levels in the mass channels have improved significantly, that they're now much more rational than they were in the middle of the year. But in specialty, I think there's still a lot of inventory. So we don't know what to expect in Q4 in terms of promotions. We think, certainly, in terms of the mass channels, it should be better. but there's still plenty of inventory out there. So we think Q4 could be quite promotional. And we feel like we have factored that in appropriately to our guidance.\nAlexandra Straton: Great. That's super helpful. Maybe one more for me is just on the merchandising org part, it sounds like hiring component is mostly complete. But maybe could you talk about the other pieces to that, that could get the business or that part of the business where it needs to be going forward, is there anything maybe outside of just the hiring and the leadership that you've already seemingly gotten in place? Thanks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, actually, it's a really important point. Growing our merchant capability and merchandising capability isn't just about headcount. Obviously, headcount and bringing in talent is important, but it's also about processes and tools. We've had -- we've talked about this before, for the last 18 months, 18 to 24 months, we've had a project internally at Burlington called Merchandising 2.0 that is focused on our buying processes, our planning processes, making these more nimble, more off-price, and basically putting better tools, better reports, better structure around those processes. I would say that this has been probably the most important project in the company, certainly one of the most important projects in the company. That project has already started to deliver some improvements. But I would say most of the deliverables from that project, 80% of the benefits, I'm going to say, are still ahead of us and mostly ahead of us in terms of being delivered in 2023. So I think in 2023, we're going to have a combination of great talent that we've hired, plus improved processes, tools, reports, etcetera. So I think that's going to be that's going to really put us in a position to take advantage of the investment that we've made in our merchandising organization.\nAlexandra Straton: That\u2019s great color. Good luck.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCharles Grom: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Michael, as the quarter progressed, I'm curious if you saw any pickup in trade down activity, some of the external factors that have impacted your business intensified and maybe that partially explain the acceleration towards the end of October? And I was also curious if there's any geographic call outs across the country, particularly at the end of the month and into November?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. So let's start with the trade down. I would say that we don't yet have any clear evidence of a trade-down customer in our stores. I think I may have said this in August, but with the external promotional environment being what it is, I just think the incentive, the motivation for a trade down is diluted. You don't need to come to our stores if you can get great deals elsewhere. Now given the changes that we have made in August, I do feel like as we finish Q3, our assortments and our values were a lot more compelling. And again, I want to be careful that there's much more we need to do and we can do. But I think as we make our assortments more compelling, I think we will see a trade-down customer in our stores. It's just I can't say that we have a lot of evidence of that just yet. On your question about sort of regional variations, and there's not -- there wasn't a lot to call out in terms of regional performance in Q3. The -- I would say that the comp performance on the West Coast has trailed the chain for most of the year, that continued in Q3. But other than that, our regional performance has been fairly broad-based.\nCharles Grom: Okay, thanks very much. And you just touched on this a little bit in the last question, but a lot of the conversation recently with you guys has been on the build-out of the systems, right. So the buyers and merchants can be more efficient and use the tools to make real-time decisions. I'm just -- can you just maybe go a little bit of a layer deeper on steps on that journey, you talked about a lot of that happening in 2023, but I'm just curious, is there any a little bit deeper explanation on that front?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, sure. Actually, I guess I would take a step back and I would say, we -- as I've already described, we've grown our merchant team by almost 50% since 2019. I think we can get better value -- more value and more effectiveness out of that team as we add improved processes, tools, reports, etcetera. I would say historically -- but when I arrived in 2019, don't get me wrong, Burlington was an off-price retailer. But many of the processes that we had, many of the tools and reports that we had, they looked a lot like the processes, tools and reports that you might find at a department store rather than an off-price retailer. So that's what I meant by our Merchandising 2.0 project. It's really to take all those tools, processes, etcetera, and really sort of reconfigure them through an off-price lens. And as I say, I feel like a lot of that work will be delivered in 2023. There's another piece to this, though, which actually has less to do with tools and processes. It's more about, I guess, what I would call in any organization, I would say that there's an experience though, I think. Again, when I arrived in 2019, there's no question, Burlington was an off-price retailer. But over the last three years, we've been attempting to become more off-price, and I think we need to get further down the experience. We need to manage ourselves down the experience curve to make sure that as we do that, we're as effective as possible and we get value out of the investments that we've made in people and systems and reports, etcetera.\nCharles Grom: Good, thank you Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Michael, you mentioned a higher mix of branded merchandise. What is the mix of the key brands now versus pre-COVID, wondering if there's a way to contextualize that? And what's giving you the confidence of the favorable buying environment including the favorable in-season buying environment will continue into next year?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. So Mark, on the first question, the -- actually, I think the best way to look at our mix now versus pre-COVID is actually sort of our mix of off-price, what I'll call off-price buys through off-price buys versus what many retailers would call an upfront buy, something that you buy before the season and you're negotiating with the vendor for. Our mix of true sort of off-price buys is much higher now than it was in 2019 or historically. That obviously that's a key part of that strategy. Now because our mix of off-price buys is higher, we were able to go after more and more interesting brands because we're buying them opportunistically. So if I look at 2022 versus 2019, we've moved the needle fairly significantly in terms of the mix of our business, and I would call it true off price. The second part of your question was the buying environment. I think the truth is the buying environment and other retailers, other off-price retailers have reported the same thing. The buying environment right now is tremendous across brands, across categories. And from our point of view, that offers a short-term opportunity, obviously, because it means we can get great merchandise that will either flow to stores or will put in reserve, but it also provides us a bit of a strategic opportunity because part of the catch-up that I described earlier when I was talking about the merchandising organization, also applies to our vendor network. So this kind of environment gives us a chance to open up new vendors and/or develop and grow existing vendors. So the buying environment right now is very favorable for us in the short term, and as I say, strategically. What would I expect -- how would I expect that buying environment to evolve? I would say that I think there's going to be great deals in the market, certainly for the next several months. Beyond the next several months, it's always hard to tell. It will depend, I think, on what happens to overall consumer demand next year. If consumer demand next year weakens and specifically, if it turns out to be weaker than the outlook that vendors and retailers have used to set their production forecast, then we should continue to see a fairly plentiful supply of off-price. And I think there is a reasonable chance of that's how things will play out.\nMark Altschwager: Thanks for the detail. Best of luck.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brook Roche from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning and thank you so much for taking our question. Earlier in the call, you commented that you believe that you can get back to 2019 margins within the next two years. Can you provide a little bit more commentary around the drivers, the cadence of recapture and your degree of confidence in that recapture, perhaps you could bucket the proportion of the margin improvement that's embedded there between each of kind of the key drivers of freight rate, supply chain leverage, and other margin categories?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning Brooke. Yes, it's a good question and we are -- let me start with sort of the buckets that we're going to have to -- that we need to drive in order to recover our margin back to 2019 levels. I think there are really three key drivers. There's sales, as I talked about. I mean we -- this year, our comp sales is obviously very negative. And with a very negative comp sales, we've experienced significant fixed expense deleverage. So the number one priority is to drive sales. And I would say a good chunk of what I've talked about this morning has been around how we're going to do that, and it's really around driving sharper value in our assortment and also making our -- getting our merchant organization to be more effective in shopping that value and therefore driving sales. So that's priority number one, above all, drive sales. Sort of lever number two if you like, is freight and supply chain expenses. Those expenses ran up significantly over the last couple of years for lots of reasons that we all understand. But we're already starting to see some improvement, I would say, certainly, in freight rates, but even in terms of the supply environment. I think a lot of the headwinds that we had in freight and supply chain are starting to abate. Now as we get into 2023, I expect to see more of that. It's hard to quantify it too precisely because there are other things that could affect those numbers in 2023. For example, diesel costs right now are pretty high and depending upon what happens with those, they could partially offset some of the benefit we might see in terms of lower freight rates. That's the second lever. The third lever that I -- where I think we have an opportunity to recover margin is actually a merchandise margin. But I want to be careful on this one. I believe that the way that we're now buying merchandise, the way that we're more opportunistically buying merchandise provides us with an opportunity to run a higher merchandise margin because we're buying the goods at a better deal. But that's not an opportunity that we're going after in Q4, I think as we've said, and it may not be an opportunity that we really want to go after in 2023 because I think our focus is really to drive sales by offering the best value that we can. But I think as we've sort of come out of this -- certainly, as we come out of this promotional cycle, we'll take another look at that, and we'll see whether or not we have an opportunity to maybe take up the margin a little bit. So the combination of those three things; sales, freight and supply chain expenses, and merchant margin gives me confidence that we can get back to 2019 levels. I would not expect that to happen, certainly not in a single year. But I think over the next few years, we should be able to get back to 2019 levels. And then at that point, we need to push on. And we've always believed and we still believe that we're doing things that, over the longer term, should drive our margin above 2019 levels. And the one example that's perhaps the easiest to visualize is what we're doing in terms of our new store program. And as we open new stores, especially as we open new stores, that are in a smaller prototype that are accretive, we underwrite those stores to be accretive from an operating margin point of view, that should give us some additional tailwind in terms of operating margin.\nBrooke Roach: Thank you so much. I will pass it on.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: Great, thank you very much. Good time to be an off-pricer. So Michael, I guess I want to go back to the merchandising organization, the 50% increase because it seems like that is the root of the source of kind of upside to sales, etcetera. So my characterization, how would you characterize the kind of buying this step sort of earlier in the year, was it a strategic misdirection in categories, right, so more casual, etcetera or was it a newer organization that was sort of more at the micro level, just learning and trying to gain experience? And then where are you hiring these merchants from?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. So Adrienne, I would say it was kind of a bit of all of the things that you just described. I think there were certainly some businesses where I think we made the wrong decisions, maybe in terms of styles or fashions or mix. And then if I sort of zoom up from there, I think we just -- we didn't move rapidly enough across categories and move money rapidly enough across categories and businesses. And then maybe most significantly, we didn't put enough focus on sharpening our value. And as I kind of described, I feel like in the summer, we kind of got caught out on that. I feel like as promotions ramped up in Q2 and early Q3, our value differentiation was being squeezed. Now as I look at our merchant organization, I look at the talent in our merchandising organization, we have a lot of excellent off-price experience. We have a lot of great merchants who've been around off-price for a long time, and they know off-price. So it's more to do with the merchant\u2019s background. I do think that it's two things. I think the improved processes, tools that I described a little bit earlier, I think will help us. But I also think that realistically, when you grow an organization very rapidly like that, you do get some misssteps. And I think we have to acknowledge that and learn from it. So I think it's a combination of those things.\nAdrienne Yih: Okay. And then my just final wrap up would be how do you make sure that you now don't overbuy, your stores are still markedly larger than your peers in the space, but just what are the guardrails to make sure that we don't over-index the other way?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes. That's a good question. We -- the key thing to understand, and this is something we've put a lot of focus on this over the last three years is that the amount of inventory that we buy, the amount -- the volume of receipts that we buy has absolutely nothing to do with the size of the store. It's driven by the sales volume. So we look very closely at our inventory turn and if we think sales are trending up, we give the store more inventory. If the store happens to be an 80,000 square foot store versus a 25,000 square foot store, that doesn't mean it gets more inventory. It's only if its sales volume justifies that. Now the implication of that, and I'm sure many analysts and investors have noticed this is if you go to some of our older stores, our older, less productive stores, you're going to see a lot of empty space. And it may be space that we've tried to manage by putting in temporary walls. But you're going to see some of that. Because as I say, we're very careful the amount of inventory we put in the store is not driven by the physical square footage of the store. It's driven by the sales volume and sales trend in that store.\nAdrienne Yih: That\u2019s very helpful. Best of luck. Happy Thanksgiving.\nMichael O'Sullivan: You too, thank you.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. Let me start with some additional financial details for the third quarter. Total sales in the quarter were down 11%, while comp sales were down 17%. As Michael mentioned, our three-year geometric comp stack was a negative 3%. Comp sales and adjusted EPS came within our guidance range. For Q3, our adjusted EPS was $0.43, which was within our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.66. The gross margin rate was 41.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2021's third quarter rate of 41.4%. This was driven by a 90 basis point decline in merchandise margin, which was partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease in freight expense. The decline in merchandise margin was driven by the more aggressive markdowns that Michael referenced in order to sharpen our values. Product sourcing costs were $178 million compared to $173 million in the third quarter of 2021, increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was driven by buying and supply chain costs. Buying costs deleveraged on the 17% comp decline, while supply chain costs were higher than expected, primarily due to a pull forward of Q4 receipts and the higher mix of true closeout merchandise, which is more labor-intensive to process. Adjusted SG&A was $544 million versus $582 million in 2021, increasing 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was driven by the overall deleverage on the sales comp decline. Adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter was 2.7%, 340 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2021. Given where our comp store sales actualized within our guidance range, this margin decline is what we would have expected given our Q3 EBIT margin guidance for a decline of 260 to 360 basis points. Relative to our Q3 2019 adjusted EBIT margin, 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT margin declined by 520 basis points. Of this, 360 basis points is driven by supply chain and freight, with the balance driven by the deleverage on the lower comp sales. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.26 versus $0.20 in Q3 of 2021. As a reminder, the prior year's amount included a $1.22 per share impact from a loss on debt extinguishment charges. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.43 versus $1.36 in the third quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were 8% above 2021 on a comp store basis, and our reserve inventory was 31% of our total inventory versus 30% last year. As Michael discussed, we aggressively flowed reserve inventory to stores during the month of October in order to be properly set with great values for the critical holiday selling season. In the third quarter, we opened 16 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 893 stores. This included 28 new store openings, 10 relocations, and two closings. In the fourth quarter, we plan to open an additional 39 new stores and to relocate five stores. As a result, we should end the year with 927 stores, this translates to 87 net new store openings this year. Now let me turn to our outlook for Q4. As Michael mentioned, we are maintaining our outlook for the fourth quarter, which is based on a negative 4% to negative 1% three-year geometric comp stack. This translates to a one-year comp decline of 9% to 6%. This range should lead to a Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of flat to up 70 basis points versus 2021 and to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $2.45 and to $2.75. For the full year fiscal 2022, this implies a one-year comp range of negative 15% to negative 14%. Based on this range, our adjusted EBIT margin is expected to decline by 400 to 370 basis points. Given our actual third quarter results and Q4 guidance, this translates to an updated adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2022 of $3.77 to $4.07. I will now turn the call back to Michael. Sure Ike, thanks for the question. So first and foremost, our three-year comp stack is similar to what we guided to in Q3, the one year is actually several hundred basis points better, given that last year, our Q3 comp was a plus 16% and then Q4 moderated to plus 6%. And while we are maintaining that Q4 guidance, as Michael mentioned, since mid-October we've seen a pickup in the sales trend. And despite a warm start to November, our month-to-date sales trend is slightly above the high end of our guidance range. So this gives us confidence in that guidance. So given the improved one-year comps for the fourth quarter, expense deleverage moderates somewhat on each line in the P&L, particularly in SG&A. And then coming down to gross margin, we expect to see favorability or leverage and freight expense, given the dynamics of what's happening in transportation costs, that headwind is moderating. As a reminder, last year, those were peak import freight costs in Q4 so we're lapping that, and those factors should help us drive a modest increase in reported gross margin. And then we do expect to see less deleverage in product sourcing costs, including supply chain costs given the acceleration of Q4 receipts into Q3 that Michael mentioned as well as we're lapping onetime incentives and hiring expenses in our distributions from last year. And with regard to supply chain, we've put in place several initiatives to continue to drive productivity. We're investing in automation and efficiencies opportunities in the DCs, so continuing there. So overall, given these puts and takes and factors we expect fourth quarter EBIT margin, as you said, to be flattish to slightly above Q4 2021. Sure. Lorraine, thanks for the question. I'll walk through the puts and takes on Q3. From a gross margin standpoint, we came in about where we expected. Merchandise margin was down 90 basis points and freight lower by 70 basis points, came in largely in line with what we were expecting. SG&A did come in lower than we had planned due to strong expense control, but as you have noted, we did incur higher-than-expected supply chain costs. These were offset in the context of our guidance with that lower SG&A, but it was higher. So let me walk you through the key factors on supply chain. It's a bit of a good news, bad news story. The good news is we were able to accelerate releases of great values from reserve. Michael mentioned it in his prepared remarks, but I think it bears repeating, reserve inventory went from 52% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter and then down to 31% of total inventory at the third quarter. The other good news is that we were able to secure a more highly desirable branded closeout buys. These buys are typically messier, they're more labor-intensive, less efficient to work through the distribution centers. So those are sort of the good news items. The bad news, of course, is that all these drove higher supply chain expenses. But as I mentioned with Ike's question, we should see improvement in the fourth quarter, again, with that receipt pull forward, lapping the higher incentives, but also with the productivity and automation initiatives were continuing, which will continue into 2023."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover four topics this morning; firstly, I will discuss our third quarter results; secondly, I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter; thirdly, I will talk about our 2023 outlook; and finally, I'll offer some comments on the longer term. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let's talk about our results. Comp store sales for the third quarter decreased 17%. This was on top of 16% comparable store sales growth last year. As we have done on previous calls, today, when we are describing our comp trend, we will use a three-year geometric stack. This metric is defined in more detail in today's press release. Our three-year geometric stack was minus 3% for the third quarter. This was within our guidance range but still a disappointing result. There were external headwinds that contributed to this comp performance. These headwinds are real and have affected our business all year but today, I do not plan to spend much time talking about these. As we said on our August call, despite these headwinds, as an off-price retailer, we should be able to drive stronger performance than this. If you look at the results reported this past week, clearly, we are an outlier within off-price. Again, this mirrors my comments from August, so I would like to spend some time talking about the actions that we have taken since then. In off-price, the most important driver of sales is the value that we put in front of the customer. In August, I explained that we were aggressively reviewing the value and the mix in our assortment. There were numerous actions that came out of that review. Let me share some details on these. Number one, we had originally planned to raise retail prices and increased merchant margin in the back half of the year. In Q3, we pulled back on this. We reviewed our on order and we adjusted retail to sharpen the values on fresh receipts that flowed to stores in September and October. Number two, we also went through our existing inventory and went after slower-moving merchandise with more aggressive markdowns. By end of September, we have rolled these markdowns through all areas of the store, and we took further aggressive markdowns in October. Number three, we raised liquidity in faster-moving businesses and focused this open to buy on great opportunistic deals. These buys began to show up in stores in early October. Number four, we used the liquidity that I just mentioned to drive up the mix of recognizable brands in our assortment. By mid-October, we achieved a much higher mix of these key brands in front of the customer compared to last year. Number five, in addition, we focused very heavily on expanding our mix of opening price points across our businesses. We know that we have many need-a-deal customers for whom these lower price points are very important. And number six, we accelerated releases of great values from reserve inventory. We pulled these releases forward from Q4 to Q3 and grew down reserve inventory from 52% of total inventory at the end of the second quarter to 31% of total inventory at the end of the third quarter. During this period, we tightened and controlled expenses, but we reinvested these savings in the actions I have just described. Since early September, we have done a lot to sharpen our values, but as I acknowledged back in August, we should have done all of this sooner. In 2022, the consumers' frame of reference for value shifted significantly versus last year. We should have responded more aggressively and more rapidly. With that said, let me talk now about the results we have seen from the actions we have taken. The main headline is that since mid-October, we have seen a pickup in our sales trend that has continued into November month to date. This is a short period of time, and of course, there are many important shopping days ahead of us. But we believe that this improvement is attributable to the actions we have taken, and this pickup gives us some optimism going into Q4. In fact, let me move on to talk about Q4 guidance. Although we have made significant adjustments to sharpen our values and we have seen a pickup in our sales trends, we are maintaining the guidance for Q4 that we previewed on our August earnings call. We are mindful of the fact and 2022 has demonstrated that we are more exposed to some of the prevailing macro headwinds than many other retailers. These headwinds have not gone away. For these reasons, we are staying with the guidance that we issued in August. As a reminder, this guidance is based on a three-year geometric stack of minus 4% to minus 1%. We hope to do better, but we think it is prudent to maintain this guidance. Now I would like to talk about how we are thinking about 2023 and our longer-term outlook. We previewed this on our call in August. As a reminder, coming into 2022, we were concerned about the headwinds and risks across retail, and it turns out that we were right. In contrast, we are optimistic about the outlook for 2023. This optimism is based on five factors. Firstly, we expect that the economy will continue to slow down. And as it does, we anticipate that there will be an even stronger consumer focus on value. Secondly, throughout 2022, there has been a huge imbalance between supply and demand with too much inventory across retail. This has driven much higher promotional activity, especially in mass channels. Put simply, in 2023, we expect a lower level of promotional activity, and this should help to recover our sales trend. Thirdly, there is a very strong availability of great off-price merchandise. This has also been reported by our peers. By year-end, we think it is likely that we will have rebuilt our reserve inventory with great opportunistic buys. We also expect that the availability of great in-season merchandise will remain strong well into 2023. Fourthly, we have made mistakes this year that has hurt our sales trend. I realize we have to demonstrate this, but we do not intend to repeat these mistakes in 2023. Finally, we believe that the expense environment in 2023 is likely to improve very significantly versus this year, especially for contracted transportation rates. Those are the reasons why we were optimistic about 2023. In terms of risks, the main call out is a continuing concern about the lower-income customer. As we have discussed before, we have more exposure to this customer than most other retailers. In 2022, the lower-income shopper has borne the brunt of the impact of inflation. As we look forward to 2023, we do not expect that this headwind will disappear, but we think that it should moderate if the level of inflation continues to fall. To sum up on 2023. We have to get through Q4, and we need to complete our budget process before we can offer guidance. But given what we know at this point, we are optimistic about the potential to drive some recovery in sales and margin next year. I'm going to finish up with some comments about the outlook beyond 2023. We remain very excited about the ability of off-price to continue to take market share over time. We also remain confident in our ability to improve our execution of the off-price model and thereby, drive higher sales and margins. I realize that there are investors listening to this call who are thinking, well, that all sounds great, but given your results this year, why should we be confident in this longer-term outlook? Let me address that question. I'll start by saying that we do not believe that any of the issues we have faced this year have been what you might call, structural. For example, there's been no issue with getting access to great supply and great brands. In fact, I can't recall a time when off-price supply has been better. Rather than a structural root cause, I think there have been two key drivers about poor performance this year. Firstly, the macro headwinds have been real, especially the impact of inflation on the lower-income customer. This has hurt us more than most other retailers. But this is not a permanent structural change, rather it is temporary and driven by the economic cycle. This impact will recede over time. I would describe the second key driver of our poor performance as being developmental. In the last few years, we have been transitioning to become more off-price. For example, we have been investing in our buying capabilities. By the end of this year, our buying team will be almost 50% larger than it was in 2019. It is important to note that much of this investment is now behind us. This pace of growth has already naturally slowed. The focus going forward will be on how to take greater advantage of this improved buying capability to drive sales and margin growth. So to sum up, we are excited about the prospects for off-price and despite our disappointing performance this year, we are confident in our ability to drive improved execution and significant sales and margin recovery over the next few years. I would now like to turn the call over to Kristin to provide more details on our Q3 results and our rest of year guidance. Thanks, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed. In August, we took a step back to challenge and reset the values and mix in our assortment. We made significant changes. We believe that these drove the improvement in our trend towards the end of the quarter. Despite these changes and the improvement in the trend, we are cautious. 2022 has shown that we are more exposed to the prevailing macro headwinds than many other retailers. So despite the recent improvement, we are maintaining our previously issued guidance for Q4. Looking ahead to 2023, there are several reasons why we are optimistic about the outlook. We need to get through Q4 before we offer guidance, but we believe we should be able to drive some recovery in sales and margin in 2023. Lastly, as we look further out, we remain confident in the prospects for the off-price model and in our ability to drive improved execution of that model over time. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to your questions. Well, good morning Matt. Thanks for the question. I think that the way that you phrased it is exactly right. 2022 has been a major setback in terms of hitting our longer-term financial targets. But let me explain why I believe that we can get back on track and what we need to do to get there. Firstly, the reason why I believe we can get back on track is because nothing fundamental or structural has changed. That's kind of what I was getting at in the prepared remarks. There really been two key drivers of our performance this year. Firstly, macro headwinds, which have been significant, but I don't see those as being permanent. They're just part of the economic cycle. And secondly, our own mistakes, driven by poor execution. So the long-term opportunity, in my view, has not changed but let me talk about what we need to do to get back on track as we go after that opportunity. The number one, the number one priority is sales. We have to drive sales. The only way to do that in our business is to continue to improve our ability to deliver value to the customer. I realize 2022 has not been a good averment for our ability to do that, but we'll learn from the mistakes that we've made this year. The other aspect of getting back on track to our longer-term financial targets is to drive earnings as well as sales. If you look at the deleverage in our operating margin this year versus 2019, it comes from two sources; expense deleverage on lower sales and higher freight and supply chain costs. As I just said, our number one priority as we get into 2023 and beyond is to drive sales. If we can do that, then we can drive leverage. But we're also very focused on driving down freight and supply chain expenses as rates and as external conditions start to normalize. It's too early to put a more specific time frame on it, but I believe that we can get back to our 2019 margins within the next few years. In addition, as we've talked about before, there are longer-term initiatives that should help us to deliver an even stronger margin over time for example, the rollout of our smaller, more profitable new store prototype. I guess, let me finish up by saying, we've deliberately not provided a formal update to the longer-term financial model that we shared last year. I'm still very confident in our ability to achieve those longer-term financial targets but frankly, for an update to that model to have any credibility, we have to get through 2023 first. We really have to demonstrate improved performance and execution. It's a good question, you're right. We had originally planned to open 90 net new stores this year, but we're now expecting to open 87. But the short answer to your question is that there were some supply chain delays with air conditioning equipment and other stuff like that. So a small number of stores slipped. Those -- that small number of stores will open in the spring. So we now expect to end this year with 927 stores. As a reminder, our long-term target is 2,000 stores, that has not changed. Also, as we've announced previously, we expect to open between 500 and 600 net new stores over the next five years over that entire period. The only update is that the actual number may vary slightly more year by year. The reason I'm calling that out is that we expect that there will be some bricks-and-mortar retail consolidation over the next few years. That could have a very positive impact on the quality and availability of real estate locations but it's hard to predict what that looks like year-over-year. And that means that the number of openings could be higher or lower in one year versus the next. So bottom line, the overall target has not changed, but the number of openings in any specific year might vary more depending on the availability of locations. Thank you. Good morning Ike. I think the best thing to do is separate out our store inventory from our reserve inventory. Our store inventory is obviously what's available for sale to customers in our stores, reserve inventory is obviously goods that we've packed away for later release. At the end of Q3, our store inventory was up 8% on a comp store basis. We actually expect to drive that inventory level even higher in the run-up to holiday. The reason for that, and you'll remember this, last year, we suffered significant receipt delays which created holes in our assortment during this critical selling period. And as we lap that impact, obviously, our store inventory is going to be higher year-over-year. Similarly, at year-end, I would anticipate that we would have much higher store inventory levels than last year. Last year, our store inventories were just too lean going into the spring. And again, you'll remember that, that together with receipt delays really undermined our sales trend in February and March. So our plan is to start the spring season with much higher store inventory level than we did last year. Let me move on though and talk about reserve inventory. In Q3, we released a lot of receipts out of reserve to build up our store inventory levels as we enter Q4. Now it's going to depend on the opportunities that our buyers find in the market but I would expect that by year-end, we will have built back up our reserve inventory. But again, that will depend on opportunities. On the last part of your question, yes, the off-price buying environment right now is very attractive. There are a lot of great deals. And ordinarily, I would agree that, that should drive merchant margin upside but I think that, that's unlikely to happen in Q4. As I described in my prepared remarks, our overriding focus in this environment is to offer great value in order to drive the sales trend, and that means that we'll be passing along great deals to our shoppers. Well, good morning Lorraine, thank you for the question. Yes, we've been growing our merchant team for the last few years. As you say, this has been a major priority for us. We know that merchandising capability is how you win in off-price. We have recognized since the start that we are well behind our competitors in this regard. We've been playing catch-up with these capabilities. I would say our peers built their buying organizations over many years, and we're trying to do it in a much more compressed period of time. As I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of this year, we will have grown our buying team by almost 50% versus 2019, this is huge. I'm pleased with this growth. And more importantly, I'm very pleased with the quality of the talent that we've been able to attract. But of course, this kind of growth takes a while to absorb and integrate. It will take time for this team to become as effective as it can be as effective as it needs to be. Between 2021 and 2022, as I said in the script, there's been a huge shift in the consumer's frame of reference for value. With all the newness that I just described, we didn't respond to that shift as rapidly or as aggressively as we should have. That's disappointing, but probably not surprising. I think it reflects our stage of development. But let me sort of look further -- let me look ahead. I think that it's important to note that the major growth spurt in merchandising capability is now behind us. We'll continue to add where we need to or opportunistically where we see really great talent. But we're not going to be adding merchant headcount if anything like the same pace as we have over the last three years. The focus going forward is going to be to drive greater efficiency and value from the investment that we've already made. Just to bring this to life a little bit more compared with 2019, we now have much greater off-price merchant expertise, more experienced leadership, stronger vendor coverage, and much greater buying resources especially targeting our highest opportunity growth businesses. So I feel like we've built a huge asset and I've got no doubt that this asset is going to drive significant growth in sales and earnings over the next few years. Good morning John. When we look at our core customer demographics, we index as much lower income, much more ethnic, younger, and larger family size than most other retailers. These are, I think, the very consumers that have been disproportionately hurt by the higher cost of living this year. And like other income groups, these demographics don't have savings to draw from. But I could say, we love this customer. These shoppers have driven the growth of bricks-and-mortar value retail over many years. It may take a while, but this customer is going to recover and over the long term, it's a very attractive and growing customer base. As we look forward to 2023, we anticipate that this low-income customer will continue to be pressured economically. Our optimism around 2023 is not predicated on a sudden bounce back by this customer group. We think that constrained spending levels by lower-income customers will still be a headwind for us in 2023, but just less of a headwind than it was in 2022. So our optimism about 2023 is driven by other factors, specifically, a greater focus on value by other income groups and therefore, more trade down traffic; less of an inventory overhang and therefore, lower promotions, especially in mass retail; an improving expense environment, especially for contracted freight; and lastly, of course, better execution by us as we lap our own mistakes from this year. Thank you John. Thank you. Yeah, good morning Alex. Yes, I think the way that you have described it in terms of the value gap, that's something we watch very closely. I would say looking back over this year, I think our value differentiation, I mean we -- what drives our sales is when we offer great value compared with other retailers. I would say our value differentiation got very compressed in Q2 into early Q3. And that was driven by significant promotional activity and we didn't respond to it soon enough. And I feel like the -- a big part of the pivot that we made in late August was to take actions to restore that value differentiation by doing all the things I described in the prepared remarks. So as we go into Q4, we feel better about our value differentiation versus other retailers. But I guess two things, one is, it's not a one-and-done exercise. I think we need to continue, and there's much more I think we can do to drive even better in front of the customer. So our merchants, our planners, our operators are very, very focused on those additional steps we can take. And then secondly, I would say that I agree with your point, it seems like inventory levels in the mass channels have improved significantly, that they're now much more rational than they were in the middle of the year. But in specialty, I think there's still a lot of inventory. So we don't know what to expect in Q4 in terms of promotions. We think, certainly, in terms of the mass channels, it should be better. but there's still plenty of inventory out there. So we think Q4 could be quite promotional. And we feel like we have factored that in appropriately to our guidance. Yes, actually, it's a really important point. Growing our merchant capability and merchandising capability isn't just about headcount. Obviously, headcount and bringing in talent is important, but it's also about processes and tools. We've had -- we've talked about this before, for the last 18 months, 18 to 24 months, we've had a project internally at Burlington called Merchandising 2.0 that is focused on our buying processes, our planning processes, making these more nimble, more off-price, and basically putting better tools, better reports, better structure around those processes. I would say that this has been probably the most important project in the company, certainly one of the most important projects in the company. That project has already started to deliver some improvements. But I would say most of the deliverables from that project, 80% of the benefits, I'm going to say, are still ahead of us and mostly ahead of us in terms of being delivered in 2023. So I think in 2023, we're going to have a combination of great talent that we've hired, plus improved processes, tools, reports, etcetera. So I think that's going to be that's going to really put us in a position to take advantage of the investment that we've made in our merchandising organization. Thank you. Sure. So let's start with the trade down. I would say that we don't yet have any clear evidence of a trade-down customer in our stores. I think I may have said this in August, but with the external promotional environment being what it is, I just think the incentive, the motivation for a trade down is diluted. You don't need to come to our stores if you can get great deals elsewhere. Now given the changes that we have made in August, I do feel like as we finish Q3, our assortments and our values were a lot more compelling. And again, I want to be careful that there's much more we need to do and we can do. But I think as we make our assortments more compelling, I think we will see a trade-down customer in our stores. It's just I can't say that we have a lot of evidence of that just yet. On your question about sort of regional variations, and there's not -- there wasn't a lot to call out in terms of regional performance in Q3. The -- I would say that the comp performance on the West Coast has trailed the chain for most of the year, that continued in Q3. But other than that, our regional performance has been fairly broad-based. Yes, sure. Actually, I guess I would take a step back and I would say, we -- as I've already described, we've grown our merchant team by almost 50% since 2019. I think we can get better value -- more value and more effectiveness out of that team as we add improved processes, tools, reports, etcetera. I would say historically -- but when I arrived in 2019, don't get me wrong, Burlington was an off-price retailer. But many of the processes that we had, many of the tools and reports that we had, they looked a lot like the processes, tools and reports that you might find at a department store rather than an off-price retailer. So that's what I meant by our Merchandising 2.0 project. It's really to take all those tools, processes, etcetera, and really sort of reconfigure them through an off-price lens. And as I say, I feel like a lot of that work will be delivered in 2023. There's another piece to this, though, which actually has less to do with tools and processes. It's more about, I guess, what I would call in any organization, I would say that there's an experience though, I think. Again, when I arrived in 2019, there's no question, Burlington was an off-price retailer. But over the last three years, we've been attempting to become more off-price, and I think we need to get further down the experience. We need to manage ourselves down the experience curve to make sure that as we do that, we're as effective as possible and we get value out of the investments that we've made in people and systems and reports, etcetera. Thanks. Sure. So Mark, on the first question, the -- actually, I think the best way to look at our mix now versus pre-COVID is actually sort of our mix of off-price, what I'll call off-price buys through off-price buys versus what many retailers would call an upfront buy, something that you buy before the season and you're negotiating with the vendor for. Our mix of true sort of off-price buys is much higher now than it was in 2019 or historically. That obviously that's a key part of that strategy. Now because our mix of off-price buys is higher, we were able to go after more and more interesting brands because we're buying them opportunistically. So if I look at 2022 versus 2019, we've moved the needle fairly significantly in terms of the mix of our business, and I would call it true off price. The second part of your question was the buying environment. I think the truth is the buying environment and other retailers, other off-price retailers have reported the same thing. The buying environment right now is tremendous across brands, across categories. And from our point of view, that offers a short-term opportunity, obviously, because it means we can get great merchandise that will either flow to stores or will put in reserve, but it also provides us a bit of a strategic opportunity because part of the catch-up that I described earlier when I was talking about the merchandising organization, also applies to our vendor network. So this kind of environment gives us a chance to open up new vendors and/or develop and grow existing vendors. So the buying environment right now is very favorable for us in the short term, and as I say, strategically. What would I expect -- how would I expect that buying environment to evolve? I would say that I think there's going to be great deals in the market, certainly for the next several months. Beyond the next several months, it's always hard to tell. It will depend, I think, on what happens to overall consumer demand next year. If consumer demand next year weakens and specifically, if it turns out to be weaker than the outlook that vendors and retailers have used to set their production forecast, then we should continue to see a fairly plentiful supply of off-price. And I think there is a reasonable chance of that's how things will play out. Thank you. Good morning Brooke. Yes, it's a good question and we are -- let me start with sort of the buckets that we're going to have to -- that we need to drive in order to recover our margin back to 2019 levels. I think there are really three key drivers. There's sales, as I talked about. I mean we -- this year, our comp sales is obviously very negative. And with a very negative comp sales, we've experienced significant fixed expense deleverage. So the number one priority is to drive sales. And I would say a good chunk of what I've talked about this morning has been around how we're going to do that, and it's really around driving sharper value in our assortment and also making our -- getting our merchant organization to be more effective in shopping that value and therefore driving sales. So that's priority number one, above all, drive sales. Sort of lever number two if you like, is freight and supply chain expenses. Those expenses ran up significantly over the last couple of years for lots of reasons that we all understand. But we're already starting to see some improvement, I would say, certainly, in freight rates, but even in terms of the supply environment. I think a lot of the headwinds that we had in freight and supply chain are starting to abate. Now as we get into 2023, I expect to see more of that. It's hard to quantify it too precisely because there are other things that could affect those numbers in 2023. For example, diesel costs right now are pretty high and depending upon what happens with those, they could partially offset some of the benefit we might see in terms of lower freight rates. That's the second lever. The third lever that I -- where I think we have an opportunity to recover margin is actually a merchandise margin. But I want to be careful on this one. I believe that the way that we're now buying merchandise, the way that we're more opportunistically buying merchandise provides us with an opportunity to run a higher merchandise margin because we're buying the goods at a better deal. But that's not an opportunity that we're going after in Q4, I think as we've said, and it may not be an opportunity that we really want to go after in 2023 because I think our focus is really to drive sales by offering the best value that we can. But I think as we've sort of come out of this -- certainly, as we come out of this promotional cycle, we'll take another look at that, and we'll see whether or not we have an opportunity to maybe take up the margin a little bit. So the combination of those three things; sales, freight and supply chain expenses, and merchant margin gives me confidence that we can get back to 2019 levels. I would not expect that to happen, certainly not in a single year. But I think over the next few years, we should be able to get back to 2019 levels. And then at that point, we need to push on. And we've always believed and we still believe that we're doing things that, over the longer term, should drive our margin above 2019 levels. And the one example that's perhaps the easiest to visualize is what we're doing in terms of our new store program. And as we open new stores, especially as we open new stores, that are in a smaller prototype that are accretive, we underwrite those stores to be accretive from an operating margin point of view, that should give us some additional tailwind in terms of operating margin. Thank you. Sure. So Adrienne, I would say it was kind of a bit of all of the things that you just described. I think there were certainly some businesses where I think we made the wrong decisions, maybe in terms of styles or fashions or mix. And then if I sort of zoom up from there, I think we just -- we didn't move rapidly enough across categories and move money rapidly enough across categories and businesses. And then maybe most significantly, we didn't put enough focus on sharpening our value. And as I kind of described, I feel like in the summer, we kind of got caught out on that. I feel like as promotions ramped up in Q2 and early Q3, our value differentiation was being squeezed. Now as I look at our merchant organization, I look at the talent in our merchandising organization, we have a lot of excellent off-price experience. We have a lot of great merchants who've been around off-price for a long time, and they know off-price. So it's more to do with the merchant's background. I do think that it's two things. I think the improved processes, tools that I described a little bit earlier, I think will help us. But I also think that realistically, when you grow an organization very rapidly like that, you do get some misssteps. And I think we have to acknowledge that and learn from it. So I think it's a combination of those things. Yes. That's a good question. We -- the key thing to understand, and this is something we've put a lot of focus on this over the last three years is that the amount of inventory that we buy, the amount -- the volume of receipts that we buy has absolutely nothing to do with the size of the store. It's driven by the sales volume. So we look very closely at our inventory turn and if we think sales are trending up, we give the store more inventory. If the store happens to be an 80,000 square foot store versus a 25,000 square foot store, that doesn't mean it gets more inventory. It's only if its sales volume justifies that. Now the implication of that, and I'm sure many analysts and investors have noticed this is if you go to some of our older stores, our older, less productive stores, you're going to see a lot of empty space. And it may be space that we've tried to manage by putting in temporary walls. But you're going to see some of that. Because as I say, we're very careful the amount of inventory we put in the store is not driven by the physical square footage of the store. It's driven by the sales volume and sales trend in that store. You too, thank you. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Burlington Stores' Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce, David Glick, Group Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's conference call to discuss Burlington's fiscal 2022 second quarter operating results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our second quarter results. Then, I will review our outlook for the rest of the year. Thirdly, I will talk about the longer-term outlook. After that, I will hand over to John to walk through the financial details, and then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let's talk about our results. Comparable store sales for the second quarter decreased 17%. This was on top of 19% comparable store sales growth last year. During this call, when describing our comp trend, I'm going to use a three-year geometric comp stack. This is just like a simple three-year comp stack but accounts for the compounding effect from year-to-year. Given our large comp numbers last year, we think this provides a more meaningful indicator of our trend. This metric is defined in more detail in today's press release. In May, our three-year geometric comp stack was plus 4%. In June, it was flat, and in July, minus 7%. For Q2 as a whole, it was minus 1%. This was below our guidance for a positive low single-digit three-year geometric stack. These results are poor, and we are very disappointed. There were external factors that contributed to these results. And in a moment, I will describe these in detail. But before I do, let me say that no matter what external headwinds we face, we have to do better than this. On an absolute and on a relative basis, these comp results are well below our expectations. When you look at comp performance in our business, there is no mystery about what drives these numbers. It's about offering the best value in the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is looking for. This is how we executed our business in Q2. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we did not move far or fast enough. Let me turn now to the external environment. We believe that there were two major factors that impacted our trend in Q2. First of all, the low to moderate-income customer is under significant economic pressure. The low to moderate-income customer is our core customer. Approximately 40% of the money spent at Burlington comes from shoppers with household incomes of less than $50,000. Low to moderate-income shoppers helped drive our extraordinary growth last year, and they remain an important part of our future growth plans. But right now, they are under severe economic stress. And versus last year, they have considerably less money for discretionary spending. The second factor that contributed to our weakening trend in Q2 was that promotional activity, especially among retailers that serve low to moderate-income shoppers. Third, the root cause of this is that there is a massive imbalance between inventory levels and sales across retail. The glut of inventory that started to emerge in Q1 turned into a tidal wave in Q2. In normal times, promotional activity tends to be limited to seasonal merchandise and styles that have not sold well. But what we are seeing right now is that there is such an imbalance between supply and demand that most retailers are having to aggressively clear inventory. Our customer proposition, the key reason to shop our stores is that we offer better value than other retailers. In Q2, this value differentiation was squeezed. Our customers are, as I described earlier, heavily focused on value. They have a lot of options about where to spend their limited funds and they cross shop heavily looking for the best deals. For our customers, the top for shopping destination for apparel and footwear is Walmart, followed by Target. The current level of promotional activity will not last forever. But while it does, it will create a very significant headwind for us. Let me draw these trends together for Q2. There were external factors that contributed to our trend in the quarter. The low to moderate-income customer is under economic stress and retailers serving these customers are slugged with promotions. These headwinds are real, but as an off-price retailer, we have advantages. The overall sales trend may be weak, so we can shift into the areas that the customer is buying and we can use the supplier balance deliver great value in these categories. Again, this is what we did in Q2, but our results show that we did not move far or fast enough. We can do better. Before I move on to talk about the outlook, let me just comment on earnings. Despite the weak trend in Q2, our margins came in ahead of expectations. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, we managed our in-store inventories very close to plan. So we didn't have a lot of excess inventories. This meant that our markdowns were modest compared to many other retailers. We could have taken broader and deeper markdowns. This might have driven sales but not necessarily earnings. Instead, we focused markdowns on excess seasonal merchandise and ended the quarter very cleanly. The second factor that drove above plan earnings is that with the weak sales trend, we aggressively controlled our expenses. As a result, although we came in below our guidance for sales, our earnings were above the high end of our guidance range. Later in the call, John will provide more details on this. So what do we think happens next? I'm going to move on to the outlook, and I will split my remarks into the near-term outlook, i.e., the rest of the year and then further out. We believe that the current retail environment characterized by a weak sales trend and significant promotional activity is likely to be with us through the rest of the year. We also think that this promotional activity is likely to delay the emergence of any significant trade down shopper. Think about it, there is really no need to trade down when every major retailer is on sale. Based on these factors, we are lowering our guidance for the back half of the year. Our updated guidance is based on a minus 4% to minus 1% 3-year geometric stack. This translates to a one-year comp range of minus 13% to minus 10% for the back half. As a reminder, our comp growth for the back half of 2021 was positive 10%. Our plan for the fall assumes significant pressure on merchant margin. We had originally planned for an increase in merchant margin in the back half, but we have now pulled back on this. As I said earlier, the most important driver of sales is the value that we put in front of the customer. We need to challenge every hanger in our assortment and make sure we are offering the best value. During this time, we will tightly control buying and liquidity, carefully managed inventories and aggressively pursue opportunities to drive down expenses. But, the net effect of all this is that we expect our results for the full year to be well below our normal expectations and well below what we believe we can accomplish over the next couple of years. Let me segue to talking about the next couple of years. Last year, actually on this call, we described the then current situation of strong consumer spending fueled by government stimulus and a significant merchandise supply constraints, we describe that situation as completely unsustainable. Let me say, we believe that the now current situation weak retail sales trends and massive oversupply of merchandise is equally unsustainable. In the next few months, we will start to work on our plans for 2023. To support this process, we have started to sketch out scenarios for what the retail environment could look like in 2023. I'd like to describe the scenario that based upon what we know at this point, we think, is most likely. Firstly, we believe the inventory overhang across the retail industry is likely to clear over the next several months. We expect that by early 2023, once this overhang has cleared, promotional activity will have declined significantly. Secondly, we anticipate that the supply environment will tighten somewhat. Many vendors have been hurt by the current imbalance and they are likely to pull back but with weak consumer demand, we think there will still be plenty of merchandise supply for the off-price channel. We also expect to carry attractive reserve inventory into 2023. Thirdly, we believe that in 2023, the expense environment is likely to have changed significantly, especially for freight rates. There are already some early signs of this. We also think it is likely that by then, the labor market will have softened, which could ease pressure on wage rates. Fourthly, we anticipate that the economy will have slowed. As this happens, inflation should moderate, thereby easing some pressure on low to moderate-income shoppers. And this slowing economy may also drive heightened consumer focus on value, driving trade down shoppers to our stores. Lastly, we think that several financially weak bricks-and-mortar retailers may have to close stores. These closures would free up potential market share and real estate. Forecasting the future is a very risky undertaking, especially after what we have lived through over the last three years. But, we believe the scenario, I've just described, isn't just possible, it's slightly at some point in 2023. We are optimistic about next year. We expect to drive recovery in sales and earnings and start to get back on track towards our longer-term objectives. I would now like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on our Q2 results, and our rest of year guidance.\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details, on Q2. Total sales in the quarter were down 10%, while comp sales were down 17%. Our three-year geometric comp stack was a minus 1%. In terms of earnings, the headline is that we faced gross margin pressure in Q2, but this was more than offset by productivity and expense savings elsewhere in the P&L. Comp sales came in below our guidance range, but our adjusted EPS came in above. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was $0.35 versus the guidance range of $0.18 to $0.31. That was the headline. Now let me provide more detail. The gross margin rate was 38.9%, a decrease of 320 basis points versus 2021 2nd quarter rate, of 42.2%. This was driven by a 110 basis point increase in freight expense combined with 210 basis points lower merchandise margin. About half the decline in merchandise margin was driven by higher markdowns and about half from a true-up to our shortage reserve. It's worth calling out that although our markdown rate was higher than last year, it was still significantly below 2019 and historical levels. This was despite the extraordinarily high external promotional activity. Product sourcing costs were $157 million versus $146 million in the second quarter of 2021, increasing 130 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was due to higher supply chain and buying costs driven by higher supply chain, wages and growth of our buying and planning team, respectively. Adjusted SG&A was $518 million versus $150 million in 2021, increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales, which was driven primarily by deleverage on occupancy expense. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.1%, 610 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2021. Our guidance for Q2 had been for 610 to 670 basis points. We were able to achieve the high-end of our adjusted EBIT margin guidance, by offsetting the lower-than-expected comp sales and gross margin with expense savings, but into the context of our Q2 2019 adjusted EBIT margin. The second quarter of 2022 adjusted EBIT margin declined by 500 basis points versus that time period. Of this, about 450 basis points were driven by freight and supply chain deleverage. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.18 versus $1.50 in Q2 of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.35 versus $1.94 in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were 5% below 2021 on a comp store basis and our reserve inventory was 52% of our total inventory versus 31% last year. In dollar terms, our reserve is more than double last year's levels. This increase was driven by our merchants taking advantage of great buying opportunities during the quarter. In Q2, we opened 11 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 877 stores. This included 13 new store openings in two relocations. Now I will turn to our outlook. As Michael mentioned, we are updating our back half forecast based on a minus 4% to minus 1% three-year geometric stack. This implies a one-year comp range of minus 13% to minus 10% for the second half of fiscal 2022. Based on this range and on our expectation of a continuing heavy external promotional environment, our adjusted EBIT margin is expected to decline by 160 basis points to 80 basis points, which would generate adjusted EPS for the back half of $2.81 to $3.41. This would drive full year adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $4.30 and an adjusted EBIT margin decline of 410 basis points to 360 basis points. Breaking out the quarters, we are modeling Q3 at a one-year comp decline of minus 18% to minus 15%, which translates to minus 4% to a minus 1% decline on a three-year geo stack basis. This range should lead to a Q3 adjusted EBIT margin decrease of between 360 basis points and 260 basis points into third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.66. We are modeling Q4 at a one-year comp decline of minus 9% to minus 6%, which for Q4 translates to the same three-year geo stack that we are planning in Q3 of minus 4% to minus 1% decrease. Recall that our Q4 2021 comp comparison decelerated from 16% in Q3 to 6% in Q4. This comp sales range should lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS and of $2.45 to $2.75. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, John. Let me summarize some of the key points that we have covered this morning. We are disappointed with our Q2 sales performance. There were two major external factors that contributed to our Q2 trend, the low to moderate-income customer is under a lot of economic pressure. And during the quarter, there was a huge surge in promotional activity. We believe that these factors are likely to continue into the fall season. Our updated guidance assumes the sales trend will remain weak and that merchant margins will be pressured by high levels of external promotional activity. Our business is all about offering the best value on the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is buying. We can do a much better job on this. As we look ahead to 2023, we are optimistic. There are several factors that we think could drive a significant recovery in our sales and earnings and would start to get us back on track to our longer-term financial objectives. Now before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, there are a couple of additional topics that I would like to call out. Firstly, we recently released our latest corporate social responsibility report. On this call, we do not have time to discuss the content in any detail, but I would like to encourage investors to take a look at the report on our Investor Relations website. The report describes the huge progress that we have made over the past year on our major environmental, social and governance priorities. If there are any investors who have questions about any of these topics, or would like more information, then please contact our Investor Relations team. The final thing that I would like to do before moving to questions is to comment on our CFO transition. On this call, we have our new and our retiring CFO. Some might call that an embarrassment of riches. I would like to welcome our newly appointed CFO, Kristin Wolfe, who joined us a few weeks ago. Kristin comes to us with over a decade of off-price experience, serving in a variety of financial, strategic and operational roles. We are very excited to have Kristin as part of the team. Of course, on the flip side of the CFO transition, we will be saying goodbye to John Crimmins to retire this month. This is John's last earnings call, so please ask him some tough questions. Seriously, I would like to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf of the company and the Board for his hard work and commitment to the company over the years and to wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So Michael, maybe taking a step back, what are your thoughts on the relative performance that we've seen from the major off-price retailers? Or said differently, comps for these retailers have historically trended together versus the wider gap that we've seen year-to-date today. So what do you think is driving this divergence in your view?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. We watch our peers very closely. We know we can learn a lot from them. So of course, we've interrogated the year-to-date performance. Let me share our assessment. First of all, in terms of the divergence that you're calling out, the data is very clear. If you look at year-to-date on a three-year geometric stack basis, one of our off-price peers is up in the mid-teens. The other is mid-single digit, and we're minus 1%. As you expect, we're not happy with this. We think that there are really two factors that explain the difference. Firstly, the customer mix is quite different between these retailers. And depending upon who you're comparing us with that could be more or less significant. The low-income shopper, the low-income shopper really drove our relative outperformance versus both peers last year. Stimulus checks, et cetera, had a bigger impact on low income customers. And I think that was really a much stronger tailwind for us than it was for our peers. This year, those shoppers are struggling, and I think that's contributing to our weaker trend. But this demographic disadvantage weren't lost forever. At some point, inflation will moderate and the low-income customer will start to recover. And I think it's important to understand that longer term, that low-income customer is a large and growing demographic. And frankly, it's a demographic that really likes bricks-and-mortar retail. It's hard to know how much that customer piece is worth, but there is a second factor that we think is important. And this one -- this is the one that matters most to me, because I think we can control and influence it. Once you adjust for any differences in customer mix, all you have left is relative execution. And to be clear, I don't mean operational execution. So for sure, there are things that we can improve. And there are things we are improving in our operations. But there's nothing there that's driving relative comp performance. So, what I mean is relative merchandising execution. Put another way, if a customer walks into one of our stores versus one of our peers, what do they see, which store has the most compelling assortment and value and therefore, where are they going to buy, where are they going to spend money. Now most retailers, either are faced with a weak sales trend or a tough promotional environment, are stuck because they can't do much. They just need to grind through it. But as an off-price retailer, we can shift our assortment mix to the areas that the customer is buying, and we can take advantage of supply opportunities to deliver great value in those areas. As I said in the remarks, in Q2, that is how we executed our business. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we really didn't move far enough. Our peers did a better job. For me, there are really two -- yeah, there are two action implications, one short-term and one\u2019s long term. In short-term, for the back half of the year, we're really looking at every aspect of value in our assortment. We need to make every hanger count in our assortment. And then more importantly, longer term, we know we can get better at executing the model. Last year, we showed we were really good at chasing sales when the customer had money. This year, the challenge is different. The challenges low-income customer doesn't have as much money. And the only way to drive the trend is by offering really great value. I think that's a muscle we need to develop more. And the last couple of years, we've been investing, especially in merchandising to improve our execution. And I'm pretty confident that once those improvements -- once those investments have bedded in, they're going to help us improve and over time, close the gap with our peers. But yeah, I come back to and I agree with you. Our Q2 comp results are evidence that we're not there yet.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks. That's great color. My second question is more focused on the multi-year. So with 2022, clearly, it's turning out to be a tough year across retail, I guess, have the challenges from this year affected your thinking about longer-term opportunities?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yeah. Good question. I think it's important to separate short-term headwinds from longer-term structural factors. When I joined Burlington three years ago, my thesis was that the off-price model, with its focus on value, responsiveness to trends, ability to take advantage of supply disruption, immunity to e-commerce, that model to sell advantage to me versus other retail models. And separately, within off-price, for Burlington, I saw an opportunity to improve how we execute the model. That's really the objective of Burlington 2.0. Now, fast forwarding to today, sitting here in 2022, that strategic and investment thesis, really hasn't changed all the structural advantages of the off-price model over other retail channels still apply. And I think the improvements we're making, a stronger buying organization, a more flexible operating model will, overtime, strengthen our own execution of the off-price model. Now obviously, I can't ignore -- over the last three years, we've seen some significant curveballs. The impact of inflation on our core customer and the tidal wave of promotions, they're just the latest of these curveballs. But it's important, I think, to realize that these things are not going to last. The last couple of years have not been normal. Sooner or later, the long-term trends will reemerge and re-ascertain sells, especially the relative advantages of off-price and the dividend that we're going to get from the improvements that we're making to the business. So I still have huge confidence that we're going to achieve our longer-term goals and objectives.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks. Best of luck.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey. Good morning everyone. Michael, one for you, I'd be interested to know what you think is happening with pricing across the current retail industry when you kind of look at it some of your competitors and other soft line players out there? And then, what might be the implication for price increases at Burlington when you kind of factor those things in?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Hi good morning, Ike. It's funny, of all the topics discussed over the past year I think this is the one that's seen the greatest evolution. A year ago, a combination of stimulus spending, pent-up demand, tight merchandise supply meant that most major retailers were achieving higher realized prices than they had in years. So there were very few promotions and margins were very strong across the industry. I have to say, I think those days are over. Now most retailers have too much inventory. And they have to take very significant markdowns and realized prices have really plummeted. My view is this is a huge overcorrection. Once the inventory bubble passes, which may take some time and I think pricing across the industry will get more rational again. So let me talk about what that means for us. We talked a little bit about this, I think, on the call in May. The thing that we really care about Burlington isn't price, its markup. If merchandise availability means that we can buy goods at lower cost, then that should allow us to drive markup without necessarily raising prices. Now our original plan had been to take advantage of the opening up of supply to increase our markup in the back half of the year. But as you can tell from our guidance and based on the factors we've discussed, we're much more cautious about this now. As long as the external environment remains heavily promotional, we think we're going to have to pass along some of this markup to the customer. But that said, once the bubble passes, we'll revisit that. And we expect that we would recover some of that markup.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks. Thank you, Michael. Second one for John. John, first off, congratulations, best of luck with retirement. I'm not going to give you a hard one. But on the EPS performance in the second quarter, it was better than the guide despite the comp miss. Could you just kind of talk us through the puts and takes of the performance during the second quarter?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes. Sure, Ike and thanks for the best wishes. And yes, it's a good question. There certainly were a lot of moving parts in the second quarter. I think the best way to answer it is just kind of run through the G&L -- sorry, the P&L and give you a little color. So yes as I said earlier, gross margin delevered by about 320 basis points, 210 basis points of that was a decrease in merch margin. About half of that was driven by markdowns. And as I said earlier, the markdown rate was still significantly better than in 2019. The rest of the merch margin decrease was driven by a true-up to our shortage accrual based on physical inventory results, we took a physical inventory in June. You measure the results, and so you make an adjustment based on what you learned from that. We also saw a 110 basis point increase in freight expense compared to last year. Remember, last year, most of the increase in freight rates took place during Q3 and Q4. So we're still -- it's kind of still a tough compare. It gets better in the second half of the year. Product sourcing costs delevered by about 130 basis points. About half of that was from supply chain and half was from continuing to invest in our merchandising team. Even though we did manage expenses pretty aggressively in the quarter, we're still investing in all of our Burlington 2.0 initiatives. And part of that -- some of the productivity gains that we're seeing are somewhat related to these initiatives are underway. On the SG&A side -- sorry, more broadly on supply chain, we also had a similar to freight us -- a difficult compare for the second quarter. But we actually came in a little better than we expected, again, thanks to some of those productivity gains. SG&A delevered by about 120 basis points that's better than we would have expected with a minus 17% comp. So again, benefit from some of the productivity improvements and disciplined expense management on that line. So -- we also had combined deleverage of about 30 basis points. That's the net result of depreciation expense and other income. Within other income, there were some gains from the sale of real estate of about $4 million, so a little bit of a non-recurring item that helped us in the quarter there. So altogether, that should account for the 610 basis point operating margin decrease that we saw. We also had some unanticipated good news in net interest expense, where we had $3 million of interest income related to a tax refund that actually nets against our or interest expense in the P&L.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning. So the updated guidance represents a pretty significant revision. It would be really helpful if you could share more of your thinking on how you arrived at the sales guidance and also any major call outs in terms of margin or expense assumptions. And if you view this guidance as conservative?\nKristin Wolfe: Hi, Lorraine, it's Kristin here. I've actually been working closely with Michael and John on developing the guidance. So let me jump in, and I'll try to respond to your question. On sales, a couple of points to call out. First, we've missed our sales guidance for the last three quarters. We need to start hitting or better still beating the guidance we give. So, we think this guidance may be conservative, but this deal is appropriate. I'd also mention the sales trend is very difficult to project right now. The reason our guidance is more conservative than our year-to-date trend as we believe the promotional activity we saw pick up in mid-June will continue into the fall. And another point I'd add is our August month-to-date geometric comp stack is running in line with this guidance. Of course, there are a couple of factors. We haven't built these in. These could help us if inflation slows and if gas prices continue to decline, those things could help. And then if promotional activity elsewhere slows down, we may start to see that trade down shopper in our stores. In terms of the margin and expense side of the guidance, as John mentioned, we're forecasting EBIT margin decline of 160 to 80 basis points in the fall. Gross margin will improve slightly. This is really due to freight driven by some moderation in import costs and less pressure to accelerate delayed receipts compared to what we saw last year. But merchant margin is now planned lower than last year. And as Michael mentioned in his remarks, much lower versus our previous expectations due to the promotional environment. And I'll also call out that the fall plan doesn't include productivity gains that will help us continue to leverage expenses, particularly in supply chain and stores while we continue to invest in the growth of our business. And both supply chain and stores in the fall of last year saw onetime hiring expenses that will not be necessary this year. Lastly, comparing Q3 and Q4, the margin decline in the third quarter is expected to be more significant. This is really due to weaker comp sales in Q3. But also in Q4, we are lapping peak freight and supply chain cost pressures from last year. So let me finish up by saying, yes, we do think this is a conservative plan, but this feels appropriate given the environment and the way we're managing the business.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. My second question is about inventory levels. Given the weak sales outlook, how are you feeling about your inventory levels? And if the sales trend turns out to be a little stronger, are you confident that you'll be able to respond?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning, Lorraine, it's Michael. Let me try and answer that. I'll start with inventories, and then I'll talk about our ability to chase if the trend is stronger. On inventory, I think it's important to draw a distinction between in-store inventory and reserve inventory. In-store inventory is basically what we have for sale. If you think about sales turns, markdowns and margins, this is the inventory that matters. If we have too much of this inventory, then it will turn slowly, and we'll take markdowns. In Q2 our plan was to manage our in-store inventories in line with last year. And that's what we did. I was pretty happy with the execution of our inventories. We ended the quarter very cleanly and we ended with in-store inventories on a comp basis, just slightly below 2021 levels, but we're pretty happy with that. Turning to reserve inventory. Reserve inventory is much higher than last year, and that's deliberate. Reserve is largely driven by opportunistic buys. In other words, merchandise where we've gotten a great deal and that we're storing for at least in a future month or even next season. The sell-through and the gross margin characteristics of reserve inventory tend to be much better than other types of buy, we manage what goes into reserve carefully to make sure that's the case, and we're pretty happy with our reserve position. Let me finish up though on the last part of your question. How confident are we that we can chase sales? I'm more confident about that now if the sales trend is strong than I have been for two years. This is one reason why we're comfortable with the conservative plan. If the customer ends up wanting to spend more, I'm comfortable we can chase it. And we can either accelerate releases from reserve, and we know we have a good reserve balance or we can go into the market and buy fresh receipts, and we know there's plenty of supply in the market. Now neither of those things was true last year, supply was much more difficult this time last year. But now it's freed up, it really puts us in a good position to chase if the sales trend is stronger.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. John, congrats on your retirement. Kristin welcome.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes. Thanks, John.\nJohn Kernan: So the full year operating margin embedded in the updated guidance. It obviously quite significant deleverage versus 2019. How confident are you that you can get back to that 2019 margin structure? And any detail on gross margin and SG&A rate is appreciated. Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, John. It's Michael. At this point, I don't think it would be fair to have Kristin. I'll have to answer that. So let me offer an answer. In the next several months, we'll be developing our budget for 2023. And we'll also -- when we do that, we'll go through an exercise of updating our long-range plan. So coming out of that, we should be able to provide a more specific path and time line for growing our margins. But for now, I think I know to answer the question at a high level. If you take the upper end of our updated guidance, it implies an EBIT margin for the full year 2022 and is about 420 basis points below 2019. The drivers of that EBIT margin contraction are very clear. Of the 420 basis points of contraction, 370 basis points is from higher freight and supply chain expenses. All the other line items combined, so merch and margin and store costs, et cetera, all of those combined represent about 50 basis points of contraction. Now within that bucket, there are positives and negatives, but obviously, the biggest piece within that bucket is expense deleverage on a minus one comp over a three-year period, which, as you can imagine, is significant. So, when we come to update our long-range plan later this year, it's pretty clear to me that there are four main buckets that we're going to be going after. And I feel pretty confident that we're going to find value in each of these. The first, of course, is freight and supply chain. As I just said, 370 basis points of the 420 basis points of deleverage since 2019 has been in these line items. Now as we said before, we're not expecting to get all of that back some of those costs, higher wage rate in the DC, for example, are going to be permanent. But other drivers of those costs, the freight rates, the fuel costs, special wage incentives that we had to give people to get staff, special shifts that we had to run that were more expensive. Some of those costs should come down overtime. And I think it's early, but there are signs that that's starting to happen. So that's freight and supply chain costs, and I think we can pull out quite a bit there. The second bucket, though, second lever we would go after, if you like, is sales. Today, we've talked about why sales have declined this year, especially the impact of inflation on low-income customers, extraordinary levels of promotional activity. And as I said in the remarks, we think those factors are temporary. So we expect our sales to pick up once we're -- once inflation moderates and once this inventory bubble passes. Add to that, we believe that the longer-term improvements we've been making to the business, especially in merchandising, will further underpin our long-term sales growth. So we think we can drive sales, and that obviously will drive leverage on fixed expenses. The third bucket that we will interrogate is markup. I think just -- Kristin just talked about, we originally planned to raise our merchant margin in the back half of this year through higher markup. And that markup was based upon an improved supply environment that we can get a handset lower cost out because supply has eased up since last year. Now as we've explained, we're being more cautious about that now in this environment. But once the external promotional activity begins to moderate, this is absolutely something we'll revisit. And then, to finish up on the fourth bucket that we'll interrogate is markdowns. In 2022, our markdown rate will still be well below 2019 line items. Now as we said before, we're levels, but it will be above 2021 levels. In other words, we've given back some of the progress that we made last year. And it's not hard to see why we've had a sales trend that's below plan. We've had high external promotions that we've had to respond to. But again, once we get through this, we've proven to ourselves, that we can turn inventory faster. And we'll get back to that. So that's the fourth bucket we would expect to get value from. Now I guess I should just maybe just finish up by saying, we've always believed that we can drive margins above 2019 levels. And we continue to believe that. And in addition to the four items I just mentioned, there are additional levers. And I'm not going to review now, we don't have time, but there are additional levers that we believe will help us to get to double-digit margins overtime. Now those include, lower occupancy costs based upon a smaller, more productive store prototype and significant efficiency and productivity improvements that we expect to make in our operations.\nJohn Kernan: All right. I appreciate the detail of your comments. Make an easy setup for a follow-up question just on freight and supply chain expenses. These -- all these expenses spiked in the back half of last year, I think the model suggests it was a 200 basis point headwind or so to gross margin in the second half last year. You mentioned earlier that there's signs that some of the expenses are starting to soften. We can obviously see the spot rates on ocean and trucking rates coming down. Is there any benefit of this softening in Q3 or Q4 as this a 2023 story?\nJohn Crimmins: Yes, John, thanks. I'll take that question. So yes, as I said earlier, during the second quarter, supply chain and freight together cost about 170 basis points of deleverage, freight was 110, supply chain another 60. As you know, cost in both of these areas increased much more significantly in the second half than last year. So the impact on this quarter's compare is more difficult than we would expect it to be for the second half of the year. We think it will be -- a little bit better for us in the second half of the year. What we're seeing overall, I think, is similar to what we've heard and what you probably heard from other retailers. As you mentioned, for ocean freight, clearly, spot rates have been improving. We are taking advantage of that where we can and when we can now, spot rates are improving in a meaningful way. And we anticipate that this trend is going to continue over the next two quarters and into next year, it's going to help us a little bit in Q3 and Q4, but we expect it to be much more help going into next year and beyond. For domestic freight, there's been some improvement. But so far, it's been less impactful and offset by high fuel prices. But longer term, we think there's going to be much more meaningful movement there, just haven't really seen that much of it yet. For supply chain costs, we do expect some improvement in the second half of the year. You remember last year, we had significant non-recurring incentives and hiring costs as we struggle to get our DCs fully staffed and operating at full capacity. I guess within supply chain, we should also kind of mention the wage side of it. We have seen that wage inflation has slowed the availability of labor has improved significantly since last year, but still a bit of a challenge. We think wages will likely remain at current levels. But we do anticipate some overall softening in the availability of labor, which should help overall staffing costs some of that maybe a little bit of that in the second half of this year and then looking forward. \nJohn Kernan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Welcome to Kristin and John well-deserved. Congrats on your retirement. I don't have a really hard ball question for you, but I did want to follow-up, Michael, on your comments earlier about the sort of agility and the adjustments in the quarter and maybe year-to-date, when trends -- when consumer buying patterns shifted and changed. It sounded like you would have expected maybe faster and more substantial adjustments in season.  So, I'm wondering if you can just reflect on what you've seen year-to-date in that agility? And where, in particular, do you think there's an opportunity going forward to improve responsiveness? And is that through better systems, better reporting to the merchants? Is that -- what are the sort of steps to get you -- to get the sort of the merchant and the planning team where you'd like it to be so that the responsive capabilities in the business are better in the future?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Kimberly. First of all, this really isn't fair. You're supposed to ask John the hard questions, not me. But I can try and I'll try and respond. The -- I guess, with the right place for me to start is what have we done over the last couple of years? We've -- in the last couple of years, we've invested in our merchandising team. We've added, I think, since 2019, we've added about 35% headcount to our merchandising team. We've also been challenging at redesigning our planning and buying processes, our reports, our tools, all aspects of buying. And the reason we've been doing that is because it's kind of -- it's a secret source of off-price. It's what drives off price. And within that, there is absolutely a very -- I think, very difficult balance that merchants have to make between deciding where to spend our open to buy, which categories, which styles, which price points. And I think that judgment improves with experience over time. And I think that -- we did all those things in Q1, I want to be careful to acknowledge, we did all those things in Q1. It's really when I do a comparison with our off-price peers, I have to acknowledge well. They did those things too and outperform us. So, I kind of feel like -- again, as I said in the script, you have to kind of strip out customer differences but if I strip out the customer differences, I'm left with that relative merchandising execution as the thing where I think we still have opportunity. We still have a ways to go. And I can say like I said in the script, I feel like given the talent we've brought on, given the changes we're making, we're absolutely going to be able to do that over time. And last year, I think last year was interesting because I felt like we really demonstrated a lot of capability chasing the trend, chasing into businesses people -- customers wanted to buy when they had money. This year, I just think that challenge is a little different. And yes, like I said, we can do much better.\nKimberly Greenberger: Sounds good. Thanks so much.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nGreg Sommer: This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck. I wanted to ask, how are you balancing the current better buying environment and the possible to even better buys down the road in the second half? And when should we expect to see those buys get reflected in merchandise margins? Is that a second half now or more in 2023?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Could you just repeat that question? You broke up a little bit as you were asking the question.\nGreg Sommer: I just wanted to weigh the balance between the current buying environment where you guys are seeing deals and the possibility of better deals emerging in the second half and then the flow through to better merchandise margins, whether that can come through in the second half or it's more in 2023? Thanks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes. No, it's a good question. We've been very careful right now. And I would say, actually throughout Q2 we're very careful to hold back on buying. Right now, this is a buyer's market. And a buyer's market, patience is really what gets rewarded. So we're being very, very careful about how we're spending our open to buy, making sure that we're really waiting until the deal is as good as it can possibly be. And that applies to reserve just as much as inventory that we're flowing to stores. I would say that in Q2, the buying environment was excellent. And I think it's quite likely in the back half, it could be even more excellent. I think, again, it relates to all the things we've talked about, the massive oversupply of inventory, et cetera. But it means that the buying opportunity is very good. Let me make one final point. When you have external promotions like we're seeing right now, it's so important that we get the very best deal when we're out there buying, because we have to compete against those promotions, it can be done, and that's the value of the off-price model. But that's another reason why we're just very careful when we're buying right now.\nGreg Sommer: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late November to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details, on Q2. Total sales in the quarter were down 10%, while comp sales were down 17%. Our three-year geometric comp stack was a minus 1%. In terms of earnings, the headline is that we faced gross margin pressure in Q2, but this was more than offset by productivity and expense savings elsewhere in the P&L. Comp sales came in below our guidance range, but our adjusted EPS came in above. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was $0.35 versus the guidance range of $0.18 to $0.31. That was the headline. Now let me provide more detail. The gross margin rate was 38.9%, a decrease of 320 basis points versus 2021 2nd quarter rate, of 42.2%. This was driven by a 110 basis point increase in freight expense combined with 210 basis points lower merchandise margin. About half the decline in merchandise margin was driven by higher markdowns and about half from a true-up to our shortage reserve. It's worth calling out that although our markdown rate was higher than last year, it was still significantly below 2019 and historical levels. This was despite the extraordinarily high external promotional activity. Product sourcing costs were $157 million versus $146 million in the second quarter of 2021, increasing 130 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was due to higher supply chain and buying costs driven by higher supply chain, wages and growth of our buying and planning team, respectively. Adjusted SG&A was $518 million versus $150 million in 2021, increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales, which was driven primarily by deleverage on occupancy expense. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.1%, 610 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2021. Our guidance for Q2 had been for 610 to 670 basis points. We were able to achieve the high-end of our adjusted EBIT margin guidance, by offsetting the lower-than-expected comp sales and gross margin with expense savings, but into the context of our Q2 2019 adjusted EBIT margin. The second quarter of 2022 adjusted EBIT margin declined by 500 basis points versus that time period. Of this, about 450 basis points were driven by freight and supply chain deleverage. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.18 versus $1.50 in Q2 of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.35 versus $1.94 in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were 5% below 2021 on a comp store basis and our reserve inventory was 52% of our total inventory versus 31% last year. In dollar terms, our reserve is more than double last year's levels. This increase was driven by our merchants taking advantage of great buying opportunities during the quarter. In Q2, we opened 11 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 877 stores. This included 13 new store openings in two relocations. Now I will turn to our outlook. As Michael mentioned, we are updating our back half forecast based on a minus 4% to minus 1% three-year geometric stack. This implies a one-year comp range of minus 13% to minus 10% for the second half of fiscal 2022. Based on this range and on our expectation of a continuing heavy external promotional environment, our adjusted EBIT margin is expected to decline by 160 basis points to 80 basis points, which would generate adjusted EPS for the back half of $2.81 to $3.41. This would drive full year adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $4.30 and an adjusted EBIT margin decline of 410 basis points to 360 basis points. Breaking out the quarters, we are modeling Q3 at a one-year comp decline of minus 18% to minus 15%, which translates to minus 4% to a minus 1% decline on a three-year geo stack basis. This range should lead to a Q3 adjusted EBIT margin decrease of between 360 basis points and 260 basis points into third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.66. We are modeling Q4 at a one-year comp decline of minus 9% to minus 6%, which for Q4 translates to the same three-year geo stack that we are planning in Q3 of minus 4% to minus 1% decrease. Recall that our Q4 2021 comp comparison decelerated from 16% in Q3 to 6% in Q4. This comp sales range should lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS and of $2.45 to $2.75. I will now turn the call back to Michael. Yes. Sure, Ike and thanks for the best wishes. And yes, it's a good question. There certainly were a lot of moving parts in the second quarter. I think the best way to answer it is just kind of run through the G&L -- sorry, the P&L and give you a little color. So yes as I said earlier, gross margin delevered by about 320 basis points, 210 basis points of that was a decrease in merch margin. About half of that was driven by markdowns. And as I said earlier, the markdown rate was still significantly better than in 2019. The rest of the merch margin decrease was driven by a true-up to our shortage accrual based on physical inventory results, we took a physical inventory in June. You measure the results, and so you make an adjustment based on what you learned from that. We also saw a 110 basis point increase in freight expense compared to last year. Remember, last year, most of the increase in freight rates took place during Q3 and Q4. So we're still -- it's kind of still a tough compare. It gets better in the second half of the year. Product sourcing costs delevered by about 130 basis points. About half of that was from supply chain and half was from continuing to invest in our merchandising team. Even though we did manage expenses pretty aggressively in the quarter, we're still investing in all of our Burlington 2.0 initiatives. And part of that -- some of the productivity gains that we're seeing are somewhat related to these initiatives are underway. On the SG&A side -- sorry, more broadly on supply chain, we also had a similar to freight us -- a difficult compare for the second quarter. But we actually came in a little better than we expected, again, thanks to some of those productivity gains. SG&A delevered by about 120 basis points that's better than we would have expected with a minus 17% comp. So again, benefit from some of the productivity improvements and disciplined expense management on that line. So -- we also had combined deleverage of about 30 basis points. That's the net result of depreciation expense and other income. Within other income, there were some gains from the sale of real estate of about $4 million, so a little bit of a non-recurring item that helped us in the quarter there. So altogether, that should account for the 610 basis point operating margin decrease that we saw. We also had some unanticipated good news in net interest expense, where we had $3 million of interest income related to a tax refund that actually nets against our or interest expense in the P&L. Yes, John, thanks. I'll take that question. So yes, as I said earlier, during the second quarter, supply chain and freight together cost about 170 basis points of deleverage, freight was 110, supply chain another 60. As you know, cost in both of these areas increased much more significantly in the second half than last year. So the impact on this quarter's compare is more difficult than we would expect it to be for the second half of the year. We think it will be -- a little bit better for us in the second half of the year. What we're seeing overall, I think, is similar to what we've heard and what you probably heard from other retailers. As you mentioned, for ocean freight, clearly, spot rates have been improving. We are taking advantage of that where we can and when we can now, spot rates are improving in a meaningful way. And we anticipate that this trend is going to continue over the next two quarters and into next year, it's going to help us a little bit in Q3 and Q4, but we expect it to be much more help going into next year and beyond. For domestic freight, there's been some improvement. But so far, it's been less impactful and offset by high fuel prices. But longer term, we think there's going to be much more meaningful movement there, just haven't really seen that much of it yet. For supply chain costs, we do expect some improvement in the second half of the year. You remember last year, we had significant non-recurring incentives and hiring costs as we struggle to get our DCs fully staffed and operating at full capacity. I guess within supply chain, we should also kind of mention the wage side of it.

            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Hi, Lorraine, it's Kristin here. I've actually been working closely with Michael and John on developing the guidance. So let me jump in, and I'll try to respond to your question. On sales, a couple of points to call out. First, we've missed our sales guidance for the last three quarters. We need to start hitting or better still beating the guidance we give. So, we think this guidance may be conservative, but this deal is appropriate. I'd also mention the sales trend is very difficult to project right now. The reason our guidance is more conservative than our year-to-date trend as we believe the promotional activity we saw pick up in mid-June will continue into the fall. And another point I'd add is our August month-to-date geometric comp stack is running in line with this guidance. Of course, there are a couple of factors. We haven't built these in. These could help us if inflation slows and if gas prices continue to decline, those things could help. And then if promotional activity elsewhere slows down, we may start to see that trade down shopper in our stores. In terms of the margin and expense side of the guidance, as John mentioned, we're forecasting EBIT margin decline of 160 to 80 basis points in the fall. Gross margin will improve slightly. This is really due to freight driven by some moderation in import costs and less pressure to accelerate delayed receipts compared to what we saw last year. But merchant margin is now planned lower than last year. And as Michael mentioned in his remarks, much lower versus our previous expectations due to the promotional environment. And I'll also call out that the fall plan doesn't include productivity gains that will help us continue to leverage expenses, particularly in supply chain and stores while we continue to invest in the growth of our business. And both supply chain and stores in the fall of last year saw onetime hiring expenses that will not be necessary this year. Lastly, comparing Q3 and Q4, the margin decline in the third quarter is expected to be more significant. This is really due to weaker comp sales in Q3. But also in Q4, we are lapping peak freight and supply chain cost pressures from last year. So let me finish up by saying, yes, we do think this is a conservative plan, but this feels appropriate given the environment and the way we're managing the business."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our second quarter results. Then, I will review our outlook for the rest of the year. Thirdly, I will talk about the longer-term outlook. After that, I will hand over to John to walk through the financial details, and then we will be happy to respond to any questions. Okay, let's talk about our results. Comparable store sales for the second quarter decreased 17%. This was on top of 19% comparable store sales growth last year. During this call, when describing our comp trend, I'm going to use a three-year geometric comp stack. This is just like a simple three-year comp stack but accounts for the compounding effect from year-to-year. Given our large comp numbers last year, we think this provides a more meaningful indicator of our trend. This metric is defined in more detail in today's press release. In May, our three-year geometric comp stack was plus 4%. In June, it was flat, and in July, minus 7%. For Q2 as a whole, it was minus 1%. This was below our guidance for a positive low single-digit three-year geometric stack. These results are poor, and we are very disappointed. There were external factors that contributed to these results. And in a moment, I will describe these in detail. But before I do, let me say that no matter what external headwinds we face, we have to do better than this. On an absolute and on a relative basis, these comp results are well below our expectations. When you look at comp performance in our business, there is no mystery about what drives these numbers. It's about offering the best value in the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is looking for. This is how we executed our business in Q2. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we did not move far or fast enough. Let me turn now to the external environment. We believe that there were two major factors that impacted our trend in Q2. First of all, the low to moderate-income customer is under significant economic pressure. The low to moderate-income customer is our core customer. Approximately 40% of the money spent at Burlington comes from shoppers with household incomes of less than $50,000. Low to moderate-income shoppers helped drive our extraordinary growth last year, and they remain an important part of our future growth plans. But right now, they are under severe economic stress. And versus last year, they have considerably less money for discretionary spending. The second factor that contributed to our weakening trend in Q2 was that promotional activity, especially among retailers that serve low to moderate-income shoppers. Third, the root cause of this is that there is a massive imbalance between inventory levels and sales across retail. The glut of inventory that started to emerge in Q1 turned into a tidal wave in Q2. In normal times, promotional activity tends to be limited to seasonal merchandise and styles that have not sold well. But what we are seeing right now is that there is such an imbalance between supply and demand that most retailers are having to aggressively clear inventory. Our customer proposition, the key reason to shop our stores is that we offer better value than other retailers. In Q2, this value differentiation was squeezed. Our customers are, as I described earlier, heavily focused on value. They have a lot of options about where to spend their limited funds and they cross shop heavily looking for the best deals. For our customers, the top for shopping destination for apparel and footwear is Walmart, followed by Target. The current level of promotional activity will not last forever. But while it does, it will create a very significant headwind for us. Let me draw these trends together for Q2. There were external factors that contributed to our trend in the quarter. The low to moderate-income customer is under economic stress and retailers serving these customers are slugged with promotions. These headwinds are real, but as an off-price retailer, we have advantages. The overall sales trend may be weak, so we can shift into the areas that the customer is buying and we can use the supplier balance deliver great value in these categories. Again, this is what we did in Q2, but our results show that we did not move far or fast enough. We can do better. Before I move on to talk about the outlook, let me just comment on earnings. Despite the weak trend in Q2, our margins came in ahead of expectations. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, we managed our in-store inventories very close to plan. So we didn't have a lot of excess inventories. This meant that our markdowns were modest compared to many other retailers. We could have taken broader and deeper markdowns. This might have driven sales but not necessarily earnings. Instead, we focused markdowns on excess seasonal merchandise and ended the quarter very cleanly. The second factor that drove above plan earnings is that with the weak sales trend, we aggressively controlled our expenses. As a result, although we came in below our guidance for sales, our earnings were above the high end of our guidance range. Later in the call, John will provide more details on this. So what do we think happens next? I'm going to move on to the outlook, and I will split my remarks into the near-term outlook, i.e., the rest of the year and then further out. We believe that the current retail environment characterized by a weak sales trend and significant promotional activity is likely to be with us through the rest of the year. We also think that this promotional activity is likely to delay the emergence of any significant trade down shopper. Think about it, there is really no need to trade down when every major retailer is on sale. Based on these factors, we are lowering our guidance for the back half of the year. Our updated guidance is based on a minus 4% to minus 1% 3-year geometric stack. This translates to a one-year comp range of minus 13% to minus 10% for the back half. As a reminder, our comp growth for the back half of 2021 was positive 10%. Our plan for the fall assumes significant pressure on merchant margin. We had originally planned for an increase in merchant margin in the back half, but we have now pulled back on this. As I said earlier, the most important driver of sales is the value that we put in front of the customer. We need to challenge every hanger in our assortment and make sure we are offering the best value. During this time, we will tightly control buying and liquidity, carefully managed inventories and aggressively pursue opportunities to drive down expenses. But, the net effect of all this is that we expect our results for the full year to be well below our normal expectations and well below what we believe we can accomplish over the next couple of years. Let me segue to talking about the next couple of years. Last year, actually on this call, we described the then current situation of strong consumer spending fueled by government stimulus and a significant merchandise supply constraints, we describe that situation as completely unsustainable. Let me say, we believe that the now current situation weak retail sales trends and massive oversupply of merchandise is equally unsustainable. In the next few months, we will start to work on our plans for 2023. To support this process, we have started to sketch out scenarios for what the retail environment could look like in 2023. I'd like to describe the scenario that based upon what we know at this point, we think, is most likely. Firstly, we believe the inventory overhang across the retail industry is likely to clear over the next several months. We expect that by early 2023, once this overhang has cleared, promotional activity will have declined significantly. Secondly, we anticipate that the supply environment will tighten somewhat. Many vendors have been hurt by the current imbalance and they are likely to pull back but with weak consumer demand, we think there will still be plenty of merchandise supply for the off-price channel. We also expect to carry attractive reserve inventory into 2023. Thirdly, we believe that in 2023, the expense environment is likely to have changed significantly, especially for freight rates. There are already some early signs of this. We also think it is likely that by then, the labor market will have softened, which could ease pressure on wage rates. Fourthly, we anticipate that the economy will have slowed. As this happens, inflation should moderate, thereby easing some pressure on low to moderate-income shoppers. And this slowing economy may also drive heightened consumer focus on value, driving trade down shoppers to our stores. Lastly, we think that several financially weak bricks-and-mortar retailers may have to close stores. These closures would free up potential market share and real estate. Forecasting the future is a very risky undertaking, especially after what we have lived through over the last three years. But, we believe the scenario, I've just described, isn't just possible, it's slightly at some point in 2023. We are optimistic about next year. We expect to drive recovery in sales and earnings and start to get back on track towards our longer-term objectives. I would now like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on our Q2 results, and our rest of year guidance. Thank you, John. Let me summarize some of the key points that we have covered this morning. We are disappointed with our Q2 sales performance. There were two major external factors that contributed to our Q2 trend, the low to moderate-income customer is under a lot of economic pressure. And during the quarter, there was a huge surge in promotional activity. We believe that these factors are likely to continue into the fall season. Our updated guidance assumes the sales trend will remain weak and that merchant margins will be pressured by high levels of external promotional activity. Our business is all about offering the best value on the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is buying. We can do a much better job on this. As we look ahead to 2023, we are optimistic. There are several factors that we think could drive a significant recovery in our sales and earnings and would start to get us back on track to our longer-term financial objectives. Now before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, there are a couple of additional topics that I would like to call out. Firstly, we recently released our latest corporate social responsibility report. On this call, we do not have time to discuss the content in any detail, but I would like to encourage investors to take a look at the report on our Investor Relations website. The report describes the huge progress that we have made over the past year on our major environmental, social and governance priorities. If there are any investors who have questions about any of these topics, or would like more information, then please contact our Investor Relations team. The final thing that I would like to do before moving to questions is to comment on our CFO transition. On this call, we have our new and our retiring CFO. Some might call that an embarrassment of riches. I would like to welcome our newly appointed CFO, Kristin Wolfe, who joined us a few weeks ago. Kristin comes to us with over a decade of off-price experience, serving in a variety of financial, strategic and operational roles. We are very excited to have Kristin as part of the team. Of course, on the flip side of the CFO transition, we will be saying goodbye to John Crimmins to retire this month. This is John's last earnings call, so please ask him some tough questions. Seriously, I would like to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf of the company and the Board for his hard work and commitment to the company over the years and to wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Well, good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. We watch our peers very closely. We know we can learn a lot from them. So of course, we've interrogated the year-to-date performance. Let me share our assessment. First of all, in terms of the divergence that you're calling out, the data is very clear. If you look at year-to-date on a three-year geometric stack basis, one of our off-price peers is up in the mid-teens. The other is mid-single digit, and we're minus 1%. As you expect, we're not happy with this. We think that there are really two factors that explain the difference. Firstly, the customer mix is quite different between these retailers. And depending upon who you're comparing us with that could be more or less significant. The low-income shopper, the low-income shopper really drove our relative outperformance versus both peers last year. Stimulus checks, et cetera, had a bigger impact on low income customers. And I think that was really a much stronger tailwind for us than it was for our peers. This year, those shoppers are struggling, and I think that's contributing to our weaker trend. But this demographic disadvantage weren't lost forever. At some point, inflation will moderate and the low-income customer will start to recover. And I think it's important to understand that longer term, that low-income customer is a large and growing demographic. And frankly, it's a demographic that really likes bricks-and-mortar retail. It's hard to know how much that customer piece is worth, but there is a second factor that we think is important. And this one -- this is the one that matters most to me, because I think we can control and influence it. Once you adjust for any differences in customer mix, all you have left is relative execution. And to be clear, I don't mean operational execution. So for sure, there are things that we can improve. And there are things we are improving in our operations. But there's nothing there that's driving relative comp performance. So, what I mean is relative merchandising execution. Put another way, if a customer walks into one of our stores versus one of our peers, what do they see, which store has the most compelling assortment and value and therefore, where are they going to buy, where are they going to spend money. Now most retailers, either are faced with a weak sales trend or a tough promotional environment, are stuck because they can't do much. They just need to grind through it. But as an off-price retailer, we can shift our assortment mix to the areas that the customer is buying, and we can take advantage of supply opportunities to deliver great value in those areas. As I said in the remarks, in Q2, that is how we executed our business. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we really didn't move far enough. Our peers did a better job. For me, there are really two -- yeah, there are two action implications, one short-term and one's long term. In short-term, for the back half of the year, we're really looking at every aspect of value in our assortment. We need to make every hanger count in our assortment. And then more importantly, longer term, we know we can get better at executing the model. Last year, we showed we were really good at chasing sales when the customer had money. This year, the challenge is different. The challenges low-income customer doesn't have as much money. And the only way to drive the trend is by offering really great value. I think that's a muscle we need to develop more. And the last couple of years, we've been investing, especially in merchandising to improve our execution. And I'm pretty confident that once those improvements -- once those investments have bedded in, they're going to help us improve and over time, close the gap with our peers. But yeah, I come back to and I agree with you. Our Q2 comp results are evidence that we're not there yet. Yeah. Good question. I think it's important to separate short-term headwinds from longer-term structural factors. When I joined Burlington three years ago, my thesis was that the off-price model, with its focus on value, responsiveness to trends, ability to take advantage of supply disruption, immunity to e-commerce, that model to sell advantage to me versus other retail models. And separately, within off-price, for Burlington, I saw an opportunity to improve how we execute the model. That's really the objective of Burlington 2.0. Now, fast forwarding to today, sitting here in 2022, that strategic and investment thesis, really hasn't changed all the structural advantages of the off-price model over other retail channels still apply. And I think the improvements we're making, a stronger buying organization, a more flexible operating model will, overtime, strengthen our own execution of the off-price model. Now obviously, I can't ignore -- over the last three years, we've seen some significant curveballs. The impact of inflation on our core customer and the tidal wave of promotions, they're just the latest of these curveballs. But it's important, I think, to realize that these things are not going to last. The last couple of years have not been normal. Sooner or later, the long-term trends will reemerge and re-ascertain sells, especially the relative advantages of off-price and the dividend that we're going to get from the improvements that we're making to the business. So I still have huge confidence that we're going to achieve our longer-term goals and objectives. Thanks, Matt. Hi good morning, Ike. It's funny, of all the topics discussed over the past year I think this is the one that's seen the greatest evolution. A year ago, a combination of stimulus spending, pent-up demand, tight merchandise supply meant that most major retailers were achieving higher realized prices than they had in years. So there were very few promotions and margins were very strong across the industry. I have to say, I think those days are over. Now most retailers have too much inventory. And they have to take very significant markdowns and realized prices have really plummeted. My view is this is a huge overcorrection. Once the inventory bubble passes, which may take some time and I think pricing across the industry will get more rational again. So let me talk about what that means for us. We talked a little bit about this, I think, on the call in May. The thing that we really care about Burlington isn't price, its markup. If merchandise availability means that we can buy goods at lower cost, then that should allow us to drive markup without necessarily raising prices. Now our original plan had been to take advantage of the opening up of supply to increase our markup in the back half of the year. But as you can tell from our guidance and based on the factors we've discussed, we're much more cautious about this now. As long as the external environment remains heavily promotional, we think we're going to have to pass along some of this markup to the customer. But that said, once the bubble passes, we'll revisit that. And we expect that we would recover some of that markup. Good morning, Lorraine, it's Michael. Let me try and answer that. I'll start with inventories, and then I'll talk about our ability to chase if the trend is stronger. On inventory, I think it's important to draw a distinction between in-store inventory and reserve inventory. In-store inventory is basically what we have for sale. If you think about sales turns, markdowns and margins, this is the inventory that matters. If we have too much of this inventory, then it will turn slowly, and we'll take markdowns. In Q2 our plan was to manage our in-store inventories in line with last year. And that's what we did. I was pretty happy with the execution of our inventories. We ended the quarter very cleanly and we ended with in-store inventories on a comp basis, just slightly below 2021 levels, but we're pretty happy with that. Turning to reserve inventory. Reserve inventory is much higher than last year, and that's deliberate. Reserve is largely driven by opportunistic buys. In other words, merchandise where we've gotten a great deal and that we're storing for at least in a future month or even next season. The sell-through and the gross margin characteristics of reserve inventory tend to be much better than other types of buy, we manage what goes into reserve carefully to make sure that's the case, and we're pretty happy with our reserve position. Let me finish up though on the last part of your question. How confident are we that we can chase sales? I'm more confident about that now if the sales trend is strong than I have been for two years. This is one reason why we're comfortable with the conservative plan. If the customer ends up wanting to spend more, I'm comfortable we can chase it. And we can either accelerate releases from reserve, and we know we have a good reserve balance or we can go into the market and buy fresh receipts, and we know there's plenty of supply in the market. Now neither of those things was true last year, supply was much more difficult this time last year. But now it's freed up, it really puts us in a good position to chase if the sales trend is stronger. Yes. Thanks, John. Well, good morning, John. It's Michael. At this point, I don't think it would be fair to have Kristin. I'll have to answer that. So let me offer an answer. In the next several months, we'll be developing our budget for 2023. And we'll also -- when we do that, we'll go through an exercise of updating our long-range plan. So coming out of that, we should be able to provide a more specific path and time line for growing our margins. But for now, I think I know to answer the question at a high level. If you take the upper end of our updated guidance, it implies an EBIT margin for the full year 2022 and is about 420 basis points below 2019. The drivers of that EBIT margin contraction are very clear. Of the 420 basis points of contraction, 370 basis points is from higher freight and supply chain expenses. All the other line items combined, so merch and margin and store costs, et cetera, all of those combined represent about 50 basis points of contraction. Now within that bucket, there are positives and negatives, but obviously, the biggest piece within that bucket is expense deleverage on a minus one comp over a three-year period, which, as you can imagine, is significant. So, when we come to update our long-range plan later this year, it's pretty clear to me that there are four main buckets that we're going to be going after. And I feel pretty confident that we're going to find value in each of these. The first, of course, is freight and supply chain. As I just said, 370 basis points of the 420 basis points of deleverage since 2019 has been in these line items. Now as we said before, we're not expecting to get all of that back some of those costs, higher wage rate in the DC, for example, are going to be permanent. But other drivers of those costs, the freight rates, the fuel costs, special wage incentives that we had to give people to get staff, special shifts that we had to run that were more expensive. Some of those costs should come down overtime. And I think it's early, but there are signs that that's starting to happen. So that's freight and supply chain costs, and I think we can pull out quite a bit there. The second bucket, though, second lever we would go after, if you like, is sales. Today, we've talked about why sales have declined this year, especially the impact of inflation on low-income customers, extraordinary levels of promotional activity. And as I said in the remarks, we think those factors are temporary. So we expect our sales to pick up once we're -- once inflation moderates and once this inventory bubble passes. Add to that, we believe that the longer-term improvements we've been making to the business, especially in merchandising, will further underpin our long-term sales growth. So we think we can drive sales, and that obviously will drive leverage on fixed expenses. The third bucket that we will interrogate is markup. I think just -- Kristin just talked about, we originally planned to raise our merchant margin in the back half of this year through higher markup. And that markup was based upon an improved supply environment that we can get a handset lower cost out because supply has eased up since last year. Now as we've explained, we're being more cautious about that now in this environment. But once the external promotional activity begins to moderate, this is absolutely something we'll revisit. And then, to finish up on the fourth bucket that we'll interrogate is markdowns. In 2022, our markdown rate will still be well below 2019 line items. Now as we said before, we're levels, but it will be above 2021 levels. In other words, we've given back some of the progress that we made last year. And it's not hard to see why we've had a sales trend that's below plan. We've had high external promotions that we've had to respond to. But again, once we get through this, we've proven to ourselves, that we can turn inventory faster. And we'll get back to that. So that's the fourth bucket we would expect to get value from. Now I guess I should just maybe just finish up by saying, we've always believed that we can drive margins above 2019 levels. And we continue to believe that. And in addition to the four items I just mentioned, there are additional levers. And I'm not going to review now, we don't have time, but there are additional levers that we believe will help us to get to double-digit margins overtime. Now those include, lower occupancy costs based upon a smaller, more productive store prototype and significant efficiency and productivity improvements that we expect to make in our operations. Well, good morning, Kimberly. First of all, this really isn't fair. You're supposed to ask John the hard questions, not me. But I can try and I'll try and respond. The -- I guess, with the right place for me to start is what have we done over the last couple of years? We've -- in the last couple of years, we've invested in our merchandising team. We've added, I think, since 2019, we've added about 35% headcount to our merchandising team. We've also been challenging at redesigning our planning and buying processes, our reports, our tools, all aspects of buying. And the reason we've been doing that is because it's kind of -- it's a secret source of off-price. It's what drives off price. And within that, there is absolutely a very -- I think, very difficult balance that merchants have to make between deciding where to spend our open to buy, which categories, which styles, which price points. And I think that judgment improves with experience over time. And I think that -- we did all those things in Q1, I want to be careful to acknowledge, we did all those things in Q1. It's really when I do a comparison with our off-price peers, I have to acknowledge well. They did those things too and outperform us. So, I kind of feel like -- again, as I said in the script, you have to kind of strip out customer differences but if I strip out the customer differences, I'm left with that relative merchandising execution as the thing where I think we still have opportunity. We still have a ways to go. And I can say like I said in the script, I feel like given the talent we've brought on, given the changes we're making, we're absolutely going to be able to do that over time. And last year, I think last year was interesting because I felt like we really demonstrated a lot of capability chasing the trend, chasing into businesses people -- customers wanted to buy when they had money. This year, I just think that challenge is a little different. And yes, like I said, we can do much better. Thank you. Could you just repeat that question? You broke up a little bit as you were asking the question. Yes. No, it's a good question. We've been very careful right now. And I would say, actually throughout Q2 we're very careful to hold back on buying. Right now, this is a buyer's market. And a buyer's market, patience is really what gets rewarded. So we're being very, very careful about how we're spending our open to buy, making sure that we're really waiting until the deal is as good as it can possibly be. And that applies to reserve just as much as inventory that we're flowing to stores. I would say that in Q2, the buying environment was excellent. And I think it's quite likely in the back half, it could be even more excellent. I think, again, it relates to all the things we've talked about, the massive oversupply of inventory, et cetera. But it means that the buying opportunity is very good. Let me make one final point. When you have external promotions like we're seeing right now, it's so important that we get the very best deal when we're out there buying, because we have to compete against those promotions, it can be done, and that's the value of the off-price model. But that's another reason why we're just very careful when we're buying right now. Thanks. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late November to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you for your time today."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will review our first quarter results. Secondly, I will discuss our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of the year. Thirdly, I will offer a few comments on the external real environment. And I will explain that while this environment may create near-term headwinds for us, we believe that it could drive longer term strategic benefits for our business. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through the financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let\u2019s talk about our results. Comparable store sales for the first quarter decreased 18%. In Q1 of last year, we achieved 20% comp store sales growth. We had estimated at the time that the federal stimulus checks have driven 10 to 15 points of this growth. As we developed our plan for Q1, we knew we were up against this headwind. So we planned the quarter at a mid-teens comp decline. We viewed this as a baseline that we would be able to beat. In fact, we missed this plan. As I will explain, this was largely self-inflicted. The root cause of this sales miss was that in-store inventory levels were too low and unbalanced in February and March. We had deliberately planned inventories down in Q1, but this backfired on us as we faced late deliveries and receipt churn early in the quarter. Let me explain what we were trying to do. In the past 12 to 18 months, we have reduced inventory levels significantly, providing greater flexibility and driving faster terms, more freshness and lower markdowns. We believe that we still have room to turn faster. So we reduced inventory levels further in Q1. We are also mindful of the fact that during the quarter we will be lapping the federal stimulus checks. So we felt that these lower inventory levels would provide additional flexibility. As I say, this completely backfired. In February, we experienced significant receipt delays. These created big gaps in our assortment, especially in our fastest trending businesses. And these assortment gaps critically impacted our sales trend. In March, we moved quickly to take up receipt and inventory levels. By early April, our in-store inventories were back up and in line with last year. Since then, our comp trend has improved. During this call, when describing our comp trend, I am going to use a 3-year geometric comp stack. This is just like a simple 3-year comp stack, but it accounts for the compounding effect of growth from year-to-year. Given our very large comp numbers last year, we believe that this geometric stack provides a more meaningful indicator of our multiyear trend. This metric is described in more detail in today\u2019s press release. In February, our 3-year geometric stack was minus 6%. In March, it was minus 2%. And in April, it was plus 5%. For Q1 as a whole, our 3-year geometric stack was minus 1%. Again, we are very unhappy with this result and we recognized that it was largely self-inflicted. Our trend in April suggests that if our inventories have been appropriate, since the start of the quarter and our comp performance could have been 6 points higher in Q1. One other point on this inventory issue and then I will move on. We have raised our inventory plans for the rest of the year so that in-store inventories will be in line to slightly higher than last year. We still believe that we have room to increase terms, but we will not go after this opportunity until global shipping issues and delays normalize. To be clear, inventory levels for the rest of this year are now planned to be in line to slightly above 2021, but this means they will still be well below historic levels. I am going to move on now to talk about Q2 and the outlook for the rest of the year. As I mentioned a moment ago, our 3-year geometric stack in April was plus 5%. Our May month-to-date trend has been consistent with April. That said, we think it is prudent to plan Q2 more cautiously than this trailing 2 months trend. So, we are planning Q2 based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single-digits. This implies a 1-year comp decline of minus 15% to minus 13%. This range compares with 19% comp growth in Q2 of 2021. There are two reasons why we are being cautious in planning Q2. Firstly, we are concerned about the economic environment and especially about the impact of inflation on retail spending. Lower income customers are under significant economic stress and it is not clear that this will change in the next few months. The second reason for caution is that it seems to us as if many retailers are overinventoried and overbought. We think that this could lead to a very promotional environment later in the quarter. This kind of environment tends to hurt our business. Let me move on to our guidance for the full year. Our updated guidance for the full year is based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. This implies a 1-year comp decline of minus 9% to minus 6%. This is up against a full year comp growth in 2021 of 15%. Our updated full year guidance does assume an uptick in the trend as we get into form. While we remain concerned about the external environment, there are a couple of factors that we think could provide a tailwind for us in the back half of the year. Firstly, there has been a sea change in the availability of off-price merchandise. We do not know if this has been driven by overproduction by vendors, a decline in the sales trend at other retailers, a sudden catch-up of supply or all of the above. But whatever the reasons, the buying environment now is better than it has been for years. Our buyers are seeing great deals. We have taken this opportunity to build our reserve inventory. At the end of Q1, our reserve was double the level of last year. If this buying environment persists, then we would expect our assortment to be more compelling with even stronger values. We know that in an environment where the customer really needs a deal, a more compelling, value-driven assortment can drive an improved sales trend. We expect that the buys we are making now could begin to have an impact in late summer. The second factor that could cause our sales trend to be higher is if shoppers begin to trade down looking for value. Clearly, there is a lot of focus and concern about the lower income customer right now. Based on recent results, it feels like the retail industry is bifurcated. Those retailers that serve lower income customers are experiencing a weaker sales trend, while retailers serving higher income shoppers are seeing stronger sales growth. But we think it\u2019s unlikely that the impact of inflation and the possible broader economic slowdown this year will be confined only to lower income shopper. We anticipate the high inflation, higher interest rates, falling stock market and a possible economic slowdown will at some point affect other income groups as well. If this happens, then we would expect to see a trade-down customer in our stores and this could drive stronger sales trend for our business in the back half of 2022. Let me recap. Our guidance for Q2 is based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single-digits. And our updated guidance for the full year is based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. This guidance feels appropriate given the risks and uncertainties. As a reminder, our inventory levels are in line with last year and we have a very strong reserve position. So, if the trend turns out to be stronger, then we should be well-positioned to chase it. In a moment, John will provide more financial details on our Q2 and rest of year guidance. But before we go there, I would like to provide some high level commentary on what we think might happen in the retail industry through the rest of this year. As I described a moment ago, we believe that the economic environment is likely to worsen this year and that this could further undermine the trend across the retail industry. We anticipate that if this happens, it is likely to create headaches and challenges for us in the short-term, but we believe that this slowdown could provide longer term benefits for our business. Many investors will remember that last summer we began to callout that 2022 could be a very difficult and turbulent year across the retail industry. At the time, we characterized the strong trend across retail as something above sugar high, driven by a combination of government support programs and pent-up demand as the consumer emerge from the pandemic. This sugar high drove higher sales and for some retailers higher margins than they would otherwise have been able to achieve. This sales trend was always going to be difficult to anniversary. What we did not anticipate last summer was that there would be other factors that would further undermine retail spending, specifically, the impact of inflation on lower income shoppers and potentially fallout from a broader economic slowdown. The important point to make is the difficult and turbulent times in retail are almost always in the long run, good for off-price. Historically, this has been the cycle. Make no mistake, a slowdown in retail spending makes life difficult for us in the short-term. We are certainly feeling that. But as an off-price retailer, we can adapt to the new trend. We can benefit from the loosening of supply. And in the coming quarters, we may be able to drive our sales trend by appealing to the trade-down customer. In addition, we believe that difficult and turbulent times in retail sooner or later will drive further rationalization of full-price bricks-and-mortar stores. We do not know if or when this might happen, but if it does, then it could represent a very important strategic tailwind to the off-price retail channel. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John who will share more details on our first quarter financial performance as well as our outlook for fiscal 2022. John?\nJohn Crimmins: Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q1. Total sales in the quarter were down 12%, while comp sales were down 18%. Our 3-year geometric comp stack was minus 1%. The gross margin rate was 41.0%, a decrease of 230 basis points versus 2021\u2019s first quarter rate of 43.3%. This was driven by a 150 basis point increase in freight expense combined with an 80 basis point decrease in merchandise margin. Product sourcing costs were $157 million versus $141 million in the first quarter of 2021, increasing 180 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented about two-thirds of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were driven primarily by higher supply chain wages. Adjusted SG&A was $513 million versus $518 million in 2021, increasing 300 basis points as a percentage of sales. Adjusted EBIT margin was 3.1%, 780 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021. Our plan for Q1 had been for a 750 basis points decline. The shortfall relative to our plan was driven by lower-than-expected comp store sales. Put into the context of our Q1 2019 EBIT margin, the first quarter EBIT margin declined by 410 basis points versus that time period, driven by 530 basis points of combined freight and supply chain deleverage. The merchandise margins for the first quarter were still 260 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2019 reflecting the progress we have made in terms of inventory reduction and faster inventory turns. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.24 versus $2.51 in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.54 versus $2.59 in the first quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 2% on a comp store basis, reflecting the aggressive actions taken by our merchandising team to rebuild our comp store inventories. Our merchant team was able to take advantage of a great off-price buying environment to build our reserve inventory. At the end of Q1, reserve represented 50% of our inventory versus 35% last year. In dollar terms, this is almost double last year\u2019s levels. We are very pleased with the great values that we have put away in reserve. During the quarter, we opened 26 net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 866 stores. This included 33 new store openings and seven relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year 2022 and for the second quarter. As Michael mentioned in his comments, the macro conditions affecting all of retail make it very difficult to plan and forecast sales. Because of these conditions, the range in the outlook we\u2019re sharing today is wider than it would be under different circumstances. We are updating our full year comp sales outlook to a decline of minus 9% to minus 6%, which, as Michael explained, is based on a 3-year geometric stack of plus 5% to plus 8%. Based on this updated comp outlook, we now expect our EBIT margin to decline by 200 basis points on the low end of this comp range and by 130 basis points at the high end. This sales and margin outlook translates to EPS of about $6 at the low end of this range and about $7 at the high end. In Q2, we expect a comp decline of minus 15% to minus 13% compared to last year\u2019s Q2 comp of 19%. As Michael mentioned earlier, this is based on a low single-digit 3-year geometric stack. This would result in operating margin de-leverage of 670 basis points to 610 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. This margin de-leverage versus Q2 2021 is driven by higher freight expenses and supply chain expenses as well as SG&A de-leverage on the comp store sales decline. This translates to EPS guidance for Q2 of $0.18 to $0.31. For the back half of fiscal \u201822, this outlook anticipates comp store sales of minus 2% to plus 3%, with an expectation that Q4 comp sales will be stronger than Q3. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Before we move on to questions, let me summarize some of the key points that we have covered this morning. Coming into Q1, we anticipated a difficult sales trend as we lapped the impact of the stimulus payments from last year. We planned accordingly, but we missed this plan because our inventory levels were low and unbalanced early in the quarter. This issue was largely self-inflicted. Once we got our inventories in shape in early April, our trend improved significantly. That said, our sales trend remains weak, and we\u2019re concerned about economic headwinds. We are planning Q2 based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single digits. And we have updated the full year based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. We anticipate that 2020 could be a disruptive and turbulent year across retail. If this happens, then it would create challenges for us in the short-term. But our assessment is that in the past, disruptive and turbulent times in retail have almost always in the long run, being good for the off-price channel. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks. So Michael, maybe to start larger picture, clearly, the environment has completely changed versus a year ago. What do you think this means for the Burlington 2.0 strategy and also for the longer-term opportunities in your business?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Matt, thanks for the question. I think that my answer is going to sound a little counterintuitive, and I recognize given our disappointing Q1 results, I need to offer this answer with a huge dose of humility. But we think that the external conditions that we\u2019re seeing now and that we\u2019re likely to see in the upcoming quarters could present a major opportunity for our business. Now last year, there were several investors who asked me to describe what would an ideal environment look like for our business in 2022. And you should file this on the \u2013 be careful what you wish for because my response was that the best scenario for us would be, number one, a dramatic slowdown in the sales trend across retail, leading to significant expansion of off-price supply with really great buying opportunities, and also leading to downward pressure on expenses, especially in freight rates. And then secondly, a much sharper consumer focus on merchandise value. Look, we\u2019re not completely in this scenario yet, but there are signs that, that could be where we\u2019re headed. I think you can see aspects of this scenario and what\u2019s going on right now. And if the full economy starts to slow down in the coming months, then this could lead, we think, to a further weakening in the sales trend across retail a further increase in supply, downward pressure on expenses and a heightened focus on value. Now last year, at the time I was describing that scenario, I can see it that those conditions would also make life difficult for us for a period of time. But we\u2019re not immune to an economic difficulties. But we know that we can adapt, and we know we can take advantage of these circumstances in a way that other retail models cannot. Everything we\u2019ve been doing on Burlington 2.0 is aimed at improving our ability to offer great value to our customers and making us more flexible, so we can react to changes in trend or supply. So again, again, I say this with some humility given our Q1 results, but we believe that the current conditions in the upcoming quarters could present a big opportunity for us.\nMatthew Boss: Okay. That\u2019s great color. And then just a follow-up on inventory supply, as it sounds like this is another situation that has also drastically changed, could you just elaborate on the buying environment today? What categories and types of merchandise are you seeing what do you think is driving this increase in supply? And do you think it will last?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. So it\u2019s a good question. As I said in the prepared remarks, there has been a complete sea change in terms of merchandise availability. We\u2019re seeing availability now in categories where supply has really been on trend for a long time. And we\u2019re seeing brands that we haven\u2019t seen for a couple of years. As this increase in supply has been pretty broad-based, seasonal basics, apparel, home accessories we\u2019ve been able to make some great deals. Now when you buy a large amount of merchandise in a short period, it can\u2019t all flow to stores at once. So, many of those deals have gone into reserve. And we will release those over the next few months. On the part of your question about what\u2019s driven the increase in supply, I suspect it\u2019s a number of things. I think that many retailers and vendors overordered and overproduced versus what they are now seeing in their sales trends. Also, I think that retailers and vendors probably built in a cushion to their orders to account for shipping delays and those shipping delays have now eased, so they have too much merchandise. And finally, the mix of merchandise that the consumer is buying has really shifted. And I think that\u2019s taken some vendors by surprise. So there are some categories where there is now what I would call a glut of supply. I think the final part of your question was, will it last? And we don\u2019t know. If the economy weakens, then we could see even more merchandise sustainability. The other complicating factor though is the COVID situation in China. It\u2019s hard to know what impact the recent shutdowns there could have. But they could create shortages later in the year. That\u2019s possible. But on the other hand, if vendors overcompensate then they could add to merchandise availability, we will have to see.\nMatthew Boss: It\u2019s great color. Best of luck.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning. Michael, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about AURs within your own business. I think compared with some of the other retailers, you\u2019ve been a little bit more cautious on taking up your retail, I guess, in light of the much weaker sales trends that you\u2019re seeing right now, how are you thinking about AURs for yourself and for your peers?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. Good morning, Ike, thanks for the question. As you say, we\u2019ve been quite wary about taking up at retail prices. Our view has been that well, our view with the retail prices rose across the industry last year, mainly because consumer demand exceeded supply. And our concern was always what happens when that reverses. And that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening now, the supply of merchandise in most of the categories we compete in has now outgrown demand. So sooner or later, we would expect that, that will pressure retail prices. And in the earlier comments, we made the point that at the end of Q2, so the end of the spring season, we think that the retail environment could get a lot more promotional as retailers try and clear their spring merchandise. But with that said, we also recognized that the underlying costs of products are now permanently higher, some of those higher freights and supply chain costs aren\u2019t going away. And for us that means that retail has even promoted prices \u2013 even promoted retail prices, are unlikely to ever go back to their 2019 levels. So we think that means that there is now a permanently higher price umbrella. And that\u2019s why we see some potential to hedge up our own prices even in this environment. Now we\u2019ve developed \u2013 I think on the last call, we explained that we\u2019ve developed a plan to raise retails really in the back half of 2022. And that plan is very carefully focused on businesses where we believe we have \u2013 where we have that opportunity. But we recognize in this environment, there are risks. So we\u2019re going to be careful, and we\u2019re going to make adjustments to the plan as we go along. There is one other point that I think is worth making at, I think we should \u2013 it\u2019s probably a good idea to change the vocabulary on this topic. Our primary motivation here is not to take up retail prices. Our primary motivation that Burlington is to take up merchant margins, if we can increase merchant margins, then that will offset higher freight and supply chain expenses, raising retail prices is just one way, the most obvious way, to drive up merchant margin. But there are two other important levers that our merchants are focused on right now. Firstly, as off-price supply \u2013 off-price merchandise supply has opened up, we started to see better deals. In other words, we\u2019re paying less for goods. In some situations, we will plan to pass on some of that value to consumers. But in other situations, we may use it to capture margin. Secondly, we\u2019re making changes to the merchandise mix, largely based on what the customer is telling us. The customer is shifting in terms of the type of merchandise that they are interested in buying. And many of those changes will also naturally drive a higher margin. So let me wrap up. Yes, we believe there is an opportunity \u2013 we still believe there is an opportunity to raise retails, but we\u2019re going to be careful, and we\u2019re going to make sure whatever we do, we still offer a really differentiated value versus other retailers. And at the same time we\u2019re going to aggressively go after other opportunities to drive up higher merchant margin.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up for John, just looking at the model, can you, John, maybe walk us through the assumptions that are embedded in the updated full year guidance that you\u2019ve given, I think you originally had assumed that freight and supply chain expenses could moderate in the back half of the year. Is that still the assumption we should use? And any other assumptions that you can call out would be great?\nJohn Crimmins: Well, first of all good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. So I\u2019ll try and explain how we\u2019re thinking about the full year guide. So first, obviously, we\u2019re taking a little more cautious approach we\u2019ve certainly seen a slowdown in discretionary spending with some of our core customers. So let me explain our comp store sales plan. I think it\u2019s pretty simple. Our trend over the last 2 months has averaged a mid-single-digit 3-year geo comp. And as Michael was describing earlier, we think the sea change in product availability, the potential for trade down, some of the executions issues that we had in Q1 that are behind us and lapping some of the execution issues we had in the second half last year creates a little bit of a tailwind for us going into the second half of the year. And that gives us reason to expect an uptick compared to our first half. Our full year guide of minus 9% to minus 6% comp is based on a 3-year Geo stack of 5% to 8%. Now also remember we have easier comp sales and margin compares in the second half of the year, this coupled with the dramatically improved buying environment and the potential for some pricing adjustments that we\u2019ve worked in. should help us show a strong comp improvement on a 1-year basis during the year and operating margin improvement, especially in the fourth quarter. On the cost side, as you know, our biggest drivers is de-leverage and freight and supply chain been talking about that for a while. And we\u2019ve been talking about a couple of different scenarios that could develop in the second half of the year. The first was that supply chain and freight costs would begin to moderate in the second half as the supply-demand imbalance kind of worked its way back to a more natural or normal balance. We haven\u2019t really seen any dramatic improvement in that direction yet. We still expect it will happen over time, but we\u2019re not assuming much improvement in the second half of the year. Our second scenario assuming that freight supply chain costs didn\u2019t begin to improve that this would be part of a broader inflationary environment. And obviously, that\u2019s happened probably faster and more dramatically than most people were expecting a few months ago. We\u2019ve previously said that in an inflationary environment, we\u2019d be confident in our ability to raise prices while maintaining our value proposition. We still thing this is true but we are dealing this very carefully. We are aware of the degree to which today\u2019s inflation has affected the buying power, especially for our lower income customers. But as Michael just said, there is another way that we\u2019re able to offset cost headwinds that doesn\u2019t rely on taking up retail prices that does raise much margins. And that\u2019s the fantastic buying opportunities that are out there now where we can get some really terrific deals we plan to pass some of this on to consumers, but we also plan to use some of it to drive margin. So to sum it up, besides the change in the sales range we gave in today\u2019s outlook, there are two other changes to our full year outlook. We now see the supply chain and freight cost de-leverage a little higher than last year. We have been assuming a small improvement. We\u2019ve also increased our planned merchant margin for the full year, building in some upside for realization of some pricing and the other market opportunities. So the net result of the changes is a little better flow-through than what we had called out in our previous outlook. When we said that we would expect the operating margin de-leverage of 150 basis points at a mid-single-digit comp decline. Today, we\u2019re saying 130 basis points of de-leverage at the high end of our full year comp range, which is minus 6%.\nIke Boruchow: Great. Thanks, guys. Bye-bye.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. Good morning. Michael, my question is about the inventory issue that you had in the first quarter. I\u2019m just curious if there is any additional context on why you planned inventories the way you did? And what went wrong? And then also, just curious if the shipping delays that you saw in February have gotten any better?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Good to hear from you. Yes. As I said \u2013 actually, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are very disappointed about Q1. We know we should have done better. And we recognize that we were the architects of our own downfall in the quarter. But with that said, let me offer a more full-bodied explanation of what happened and what we were trying to do. And I think the best starting point is that we believed, rightly so turned out, that 2022 would be a difficult and unpredictable year in retail. And as you have heard us say in the past, our strategy for dealing with uncertainty and our playbook, if you like, is to be as nimble and flexible as possible. And that\u2019s really a core principle behind Burlington 2.0. So, with that in mind, when we planned 2022, we tried to do three things. First of all, we planned sales conservatively. Now we are happy that we did this. It\u2019s clear it was the right thing to do. It looks like many other retailers were more optimistic. And as a result, they are now over-bought and over-inventory, and we are not. That means that we have a bit more flexibility to respond to buying opportunities. And secondly, in addition to spending conservatively, we planned our liquidity very tightly. For example, this means that we still have open to buy for the second quarter and the rest of the year. And again, that just gives us more flexibility given the current external environment. Now the third thing we did, and this is the one that goes to the heart of your question, we have planned our inventories conservatively. We believe we can turn faster. And these plans were, again, intended to increase our flexibility. Now, as I said in the remarks, this did not work. In fact, instead of providing flexibility, these leaner inventories meant that we were exposed when the receipts did not show up early in Q1. This was a mistake and [indiscernible]. Let me move on to the last part of your question, have the receipt delays improved since February, the answer is yes, they have. The situation has completely changed. Just a few months ago, many vendors we are living hand to mouth. Their warehouses were empty, and they were literally just in time, waiting for merchandise to get through the ports. Now, a few months later, domestic warehouses are full. And in many cases, they are backing up. So, in this situation, the vendors really want to get the goods or as soon as possible. So, as you would expect shipping delays have fallen off dramatically.\nLorraineHutchinson: Thanks. And just a follow-up question for John. John, you talked about some of the freight pressures you are seeing, any other main margin drivers to call out versus 2021 and then also versus 2019 levels? Thanks.\nJohn Crimmins: Good morning Lorraine, thanks. It\u2019s a good question. So, I will start with Q1, and then I will try and give you a little color on the way we are thinking about Q2 and the full year margins as well. So, yes, as I said a little earlier in the call, our \u2013 for Q1, our EBIT climbed by 780 basis points. And that missed the outlook that we had given by about 30 basis points. That was pretty much all related to the more deleverage on our expense base by our comp sales coming up short of our mid-teens baseline plan. About 230 basis points of the deleverage versus last year was in gross margin. And 150 of that would be related to freight, 80 basis points on the merch margin side. Product sourcing costs delevered by 180 basis points. And again, that was about 120 bps supply chain and 80 basis points related to our continued investments in our merchandising team. So, the rest of the leverage, another 370 basis points, was just deleveraged on all other costs driven by the pretty large decrease in comp sales. When you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, EBIT declined 410 basis points, which was entirely driven by 530 bps of combined freight and supply chain deleverage. In fact, the merch margins for the first quarter were still 260 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2019. And that\u2019s a reflection of the progress that we have made turning inventory faster and operating with smaller inventories in our stores. So, moving on to the second quarter, we said today, we expect operating deleverage of 670 basis points, 610 basis points on our comp range of minus 15% to minus 13% compared to last year\u2019s plus 19% comp. Compared to Q2 of 2019, that would mean deleverage of 500 bps at the high end of the range, the minus 13% comp. And the majority of that will be driven by freight and supply chain deleverage. We do expect to have some merchant margin growth in that but that\u2019s pretty much going to be offset by the deleverage on all other expenses of that negative comp level. And then finally, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, we are expecting our operating margin rate to be a little better than what we said in the last call. 150 basis points of operating margin deleverage at mid-single digit comp decline was our previous outlook. Now, we are saying that the minus 6% comp, we are expecting 130 bps of operating margin contraction. So, a couple of things that changed there. First, we anticipate higher gross margin rate, resulting from better merch margin driven by the combination of a great product availability, which drives cost down and some selective price increases, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a little higher than expected freight and supply chain costs including some higher domestic freight fuel cost than what we had anticipated as we developed our plan. So, again, at the minus 6% comp, high end of our range, our EBIT margin would be 7.3%. So, compare that to a 2019 operating margin of 9.2% and its deleverage of 190 basis points. We expect the deleverage story for the full year is going to be very similar to what we talked about in Q1 and what I just said we kind of expect in Q2, significant deleverage caused by freight and supply chain costs some additional deleverage on the fixed cost base and all of that deleverage partially offset by substantial gross margin growth. So, that\u2019s kind of the whole picture.\nLorraineHutchinson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning Michael, John and David, just a couple of questions about the macro environment and your customer. Michael, in your remarks, you referenced the low-income consumer being under economic pressure, that\u2019s intuitive given the inflationary environment. How should we think about that \u2013 the relative importance of that demographic to your business? Are there any stats you could share with us? Also curious on just detail on what you are seeing with that customer, how their traffic conversion and basket levels are trending?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning John. I would say, compared to many retailers, I would characterize our core customer demographics as younger, more ethnically diverse and larger family size and low to moderate income. And I would say that we were got those as wonderful demographics. This segment of the population is growing and understands value. And in many ways, populate that customer group represents everything that\u2019s growing in America. So \u2013 and in fact, for many years, I think low to moderate income shoppers have been the growth engine, not just for us but for value retail as a whole, especially bricks-and-mortar value retail. Of course, as you say, this customer the low-to-moderate income customer is under a lot of pressure right now, that makes sense. In 2021, certainly in proportion to their income, these shoppers were big beneficiaries of government support programs, stimulus checks, child benefit, extended unemployment \u2013 and those programs have now gone. That alone would have made 2022 a difficult year. But if you layer on top of that, retail price inflation for essential items like food and gas is now running at extraordinarily high levels. And again, those items represent a disproportionate share of household budgets for those shoppers. So, it\u2019s not difficult to see why the customer is under significant economic stress. Now, what can we share, well, we see this in our own data. The vast majority of our stores are in trade areas that have average how household income below $75,000, so the vast majority of our stores. And in 2021, our stores that are in low to moderate income areas had, by far, the strongest increase in comp sales across our chain. And this year, quite surprisingly, this year, they have shown biggest deceleration. Now in the short-term, we don\u2019t expect that the economic conditions to these consumers is going to improve in the short-term. But we do think it\u2019s a big opportunity for us. These shoppers need value now more than ever. And in the coming quarters, we think we can do a much better job of delivering that value. Let me wrap up my answer by reinforcing the point that these customers are the future yes, right now, they are facing headwinds, and those headwinds are likely to persist for the next few quarters. But this is a large demographic group, and these customers are coming back. In the coming years, we believe that this will again be a major source of growth for value retail, especially bricks-and-mortar value retail.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe just one other follow-up question, again, related to the consumer. Are you seeing any evidence of a trade-down customer in the store? Do you think that trade down business is likely to be a meaningful sales driver over time? And is there any built \u2013 any of that built into the second half guidance?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think we have seen much of a trade-down customer so far. But we do think that in the back half of this year, that could change \u2013 and that\u2019s why we are actually a little more optimistic about the back half of the year, and we have got in an element of that to our guidance. Yes, a moment ago, I said that it makes sense that the lower income customer is struggling. But we don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s \u2013 this is where the economic stress is going to end. I think it\u2019s possible that we are only in the opening stages of this economy. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but it seems likely to us that high inflation, higher interest rates, falling stock market and a potential recession, it is going to affect a much broader set of consumers at some point. And when those consumers are squeezed, we think that they, too, will be looking for value and that they may break down. And historically, that is typically what has happened. Whenever there has been a broader economic slowdown, it hasn\u2019t just affected low income shoppers, it\u2019s also affected the mid-low and some higher end shoppers. In that situation, everyone cares about value. So, again, we don\u2019t know when this might happen, but if it does, then we believe that it may help drive our sales trend.\nJohn Kernan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.\nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Good morning and thanks for all the detail today. Michael, how are you feeling about your merchandise assortment now speaking to both quality and quantity. And based on your earlier comments, it sounds like you are in a position to chase now here in the second quarter and in the back half of the year. Assuming I heard you right on that, as you chase now, are you starting to get delivered on time, or are you still experiencing significant delays in your inventory receipts?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning Kim. So, the first part of your question, how are we feeling about the assortment right now, in terms of quantity, the overall level of inventory, I would say we feel very good. Our industry right now just a little bit higher than last year. And last year, as a reminder, in the second quarter, we made 19% comp. So, I feel pretty good about our entry level right now. The quality and the content, I feel good about the quality of the content of our inventory and our assortment. But I would say that we recognize there is actually huge opportunity to take it from good to great. We actually think that \u2013 there is a lot of opportunities to make our assortment much better than it is. The starting point is good, but I think we can make it much better. And the reason I say that is there are a couple of things that have happened in the past month or so \u2013 the first is, I really do think it\u2019s become clear that the customer has shifted in terms of the categories that they are buying right now. And some of this is intuitive. Last year, the hottest trending categories were home, active apparel, casual apparel basics. This year, the customer has pivoted. They are interested in dressier, classifications, back to office, career-wear, much more structured apparel, woven versus mix. And we had anticipated some of that, but it\u2019s happening to an even greater extent than we anticipated. So, I think we have an opportunity to shift our assortment more in that direction. And then secondly, the other thing that\u2019s really happened over the past couple of months is just this point about merchandise availability has opened up, and there are really great deals out there. Now as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, when you see great deals out there, you can\u2019t just buy everything and flow it to stores straight away. You need to sort of flow into stores over a period of time. So, it takes a while for it to bleed into your assortment. But over the next few quarters, I really think we are going to have greater value in our assortment, much more compelling values. So, we are very excited about that. Now, the second part of your question, I think was about are we in a position to chase. And I think the answer is yes, we feel really good about the case right now, partly because obviously, our inventory level is already at a pretty good point. But secondly, we have a lot of merchandise in reserve that we can pull on. And then, as I say, much nicer availability in terms of going out there now and buying merchandise that we can flow to stores has also improved. So, we feel good about our ability to chase in the second quarter of the sales and runs ahead. And on our timely deliveries of receipts, Again, that\u2019s completely changed during the last couple of months, the situation in terms of the amount of merchandise that\u2019s now in the country, and that\u2019s been imported into the country over the past few months, means that domestic warehouses are pretty full. And as a result, our vendors are shipping on time because they want to get those goods out of their warehouse three months or four months ago, their warehouses were acting and they are waiting for goods to come out of the port. So, as I said, that\u2019s completely changed in the couple of months.\nKimberly Greenberger: Very helpful. Thanks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks Kim.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked, but I just have one question for you, Michael, just given your experience in the industry. When you look back at other periods of consumer duress, maybe 2008 or I am sure there is other times in the history of off-price. How long of a lag was it before you saw that middle-income customers start to trade down? It looks like right now, you are in a little bit of an air pocket where you are not getting the trade down, but your current consumers starting to pull back a little bit. So, just curious your perspective on the timing.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Chuck. We have been thinking about that. I would say that obviously, the previous economic slowdown as the most \u2013 maybe the most applicable is the financial crisis in 2008. But I would say that the one difference between what happened then and what\u2019s happening now is in 2008, the financial crisis kind of came as a shock to the whole economy all at once. Like, in September of 2008, it was kind of \u2013 it was felt across the whole economy. And then that sort of then led into what happened in 2009 and 2010. So, like here in 2022, this is a little bit different and that the inflation impact, please to begin with is being felt more by low-income customers. They are the ones facing immediate shock because when you look at the cost of gas prices and food, those items represent such a big share of their wallet that the big increases we have seen in those areas are really hitting those customers most of all. But as I said in my earlier remarks, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop there. I think the impact on the overall economy is coming. It\u2019s ahead of us. Now, we could be wrong, but that seems to us to be likely. And therefore, it seems to me that the trade-down customer, which might be more evident back in 2008 and more evident earlier, might take a little bit longer this time around. But we don\u2019t really know, but that\u2019s how I would compare it with previous economic slowdowns.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thanks very much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks Chuck.\nOperator: And now \u2013 I would now like to turn the call back to Michael O\u2019Sullivan for any closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "John Crimmins",
            "content": "Thanks, Michael and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q1. Total sales in the quarter were down 12%, while comp sales were down 18%. Our 3-year geometric comp stack was minus 1%. The gross margin rate was 41.0%, a decrease of 230 basis points versus 2021's first quarter rate of 43.3%. This was driven by a 150 basis point increase in freight expense combined with an 80 basis point decrease in merchandise margin. Product sourcing costs were $157 million versus $141 million in the first quarter of 2021, increasing 180 basis points as a percentage of sales. Higher supply chain costs represented about two-thirds of the deleverage. The drivers of these higher costs were driven primarily by higher supply chain wages. Adjusted SG&A was $513 million versus $518 million in 2021, increasing 300 basis points as a percentage of sales. Adjusted EBIT margin was 3.1%, 780 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021. Our plan for Q1 had been for a 750 basis points decline. The shortfall relative to our plan was driven by lower-than-expected comp store sales. Put into the context of our Q1 2019 EBIT margin, the first quarter EBIT margin declined by 410 basis points versus that time period, driven by 530 basis points of combined freight and supply chain deleverage. The merchandise margins for the first quarter were still 260 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2019 reflecting the progress we have made in terms of inventory reduction and faster inventory turns. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.24 versus $2.51 in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.54 versus $2.59 in the first quarter of 2021. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 2% on a comp store basis, reflecting the aggressive actions taken by our merchandising team to rebuild our comp store inventories. Our merchant team was able to take advantage of a great off-price buying environment to build our reserve inventory. At the end of Q1, reserve represented 50% of our inventory versus 35% last year. In dollar terms, this is almost double last year's levels. We are very pleased with the great values that we have put away in reserve. During the quarter, we opened 26 net new stores bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 866 stores. This included 33 new store openings and seven relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year 2022 and for the second quarter. As Michael mentioned in his comments, the macro conditions affecting all of retail make it very difficult to plan and forecast sales. Because of these conditions, the range in the outlook we're sharing today is wider than it would be under different circumstances. We are updating our full year comp sales outlook to a decline of minus 9% to minus 6%, which, as Michael explained, is based on a 3-year geometric stack of plus 5% to plus 8%. Based on this updated comp outlook, we now expect our EBIT margin to decline by 200 basis points on the low end of this comp range and by 130 basis points at the high end. This sales and margin outlook translates to EPS of about $6 at the low end of this range and about $7 at the high end. In Q2, we expect a comp decline of minus 15% to minus 13% compared to last year's Q2 comp of 19%. As Michael mentioned earlier, this is based on a low single-digit 3-year geometric stack. This would result in operating margin de-leverage of 670 basis points to 610 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. This margin de-leverage versus Q2 2021 is driven by higher freight expenses and supply chain expenses as well as SG&A de-leverage on the comp store sales decline. This translates to EPS guidance for Q2 of $0.18 to $0.31. For the back half of fiscal \u201822, this outlook anticipates comp store sales of minus 2% to plus 3%, with an expectation that Q4 comp sales will be stronger than Q3. I will now turn the call back to Michael. Well, first of all good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. So I'll try and explain how we're thinking about the full year guide. So first, obviously, we're taking a little more cautious approach we've certainly seen a slowdown in discretionary spending with some of our core customers. So let me explain our comp store sales plan. I think it's pretty simple. Our trend over the last 2 months has averaged a mid-single-digit 3-year geo comp. And as Michael was describing earlier, we think the sea change in product availability, the potential for trade down, some of the executions issues that we had in Q1 that are behind us and lapping some of the execution issues we had in the second half last year creates a little bit of a tailwind for us going into the second half of the year. And that gives us reason to expect an uptick compared to our first half. Our full year guide of minus 9% to minus 6% comp is based on a 3-year Geo stack of 5% to 8%. Now also remember we have easier comp sales and margin compares in the second half of the year, this coupled with the dramatically improved buying environment and the potential for some pricing adjustments that we've worked in. should help us show a strong comp improvement on a 1-year basis during the year and operating margin improvement, especially in the fourth quarter. On the cost side, as you know, our biggest drivers is de-leverage and freight and supply chain been talking about that for a while. And we've been talking about a couple of different scenarios that could develop in the second half of the year. The first was that supply chain and freight costs would begin to moderate in the second half as the supply-demand imbalance kind of worked its way back to a more natural or normal balance. We haven't really seen any dramatic improvement in that direction yet. We still expect it will happen over time, but we're not assuming much improvement in the second half of the year. Our second scenario assuming that freight supply chain costs didn't begin to improve that this would be part of a broader inflationary environment. And obviously, that's happened probably faster and more dramatically than most people were expecting a few months ago. We've previously said that in an inflationary environment, we'd be confident in our ability to raise prices while maintaining our value proposition. We still thing this is true but we are dealing this very carefully. We are aware of the degree to which today's inflation has affected the buying power, especially for our lower income customers. But as Michael just said, there is another way that we're able to offset cost headwinds that doesn't rely on taking up retail prices that does raise much margins. And that's the fantastic buying opportunities that are out there now where we can get some really terrific deals we plan to pass some of this on to consumers, but we also plan to use some of it to drive margin. So to sum it up, besides the change in the sales range we gave in today's outlook, there are two other changes to our full year outlook. We now see the supply chain and freight cost de-leverage a little higher than last year. We have been assuming a small improvement. We've also increased our planned merchant margin for the full year, building in some upside for realization of some pricing and the other market opportunities. So the net result of the changes is a little better flow-through than what we had called out in our previous outlook. When we said that we would expect the operating margin de-leverage of 150 basis points at a mid-single-digit comp decline. Today, we're saying 130 basis points of de-leverage at the high end of our full year comp range, which is minus 6%. Good morning Lorraine, thanks. It's a good question. So, I will start with Q1, and then I will try and give you a little color on the way we are thinking about Q2 and the full year margins as well. So, yes, as I said a little earlier in the call, our \u2013 for Q1, our EBIT climbed by 780 basis points. And that missed the outlook that we had given by about 30 basis points. That was pretty much all related to the more deleverage on our expense base by our comp sales coming up short of our mid-teens baseline plan. About 230 basis points of the deleverage versus last year was in gross margin. And 150 of that would be related to freight, 80 basis points on the merch margin side. Product sourcing costs delevered by 180 basis points. And again, that was about 120 bps supply chain and 80 basis points related to our continued investments in our merchandising team. So, the rest of the leverage, another 370 basis points, was just deleveraged on all other costs driven by the pretty large decrease in comp sales. When you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, EBIT declined 410 basis points, which was entirely driven by 530 bps of combined freight and supply chain deleverage. In fact, the merch margins for the first quarter were still 260 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2019. And that's a reflection of the progress that we have made turning inventory faster and operating with smaller inventories in our stores. So, moving on to the second quarter, we said today, we expect operating deleverage of 670 basis points, 610 basis points on our comp range of minus 15% to minus 13% compared to last year's plus 19% comp. Compared to Q2 of 2019, that would mean deleverage of 500 bps at the high end of the range, the minus 13% comp. And the majority of that will be driven by freight and supply chain deleverage. We do expect to have some merchant margin growth in that but that's pretty much going to be offset by the deleverage on all other expenses of that negative comp level. And then finally, for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, we are expecting our operating margin rate to be a little better than what we said in the last call. 150 basis points of operating margin deleverage at mid-single digit comp decline was our previous outlook. Now, we are saying that the minus 6% comp, we are expecting 130 bps of operating margin contraction. So, a couple of things that changed there. First, we anticipate higher gross margin rate, resulting from better merch margin driven by the combination of a great product availability, which drives cost down and some selective price increases, as I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a little higher than expected freight and supply chain costs including some higher domestic freight fuel cost than what we had anticipated as we developed our plan. So, again, at the minus 6% comp, high end of our range, our EBIT margin would be 7.3%. So, compare that to a 2019 operating margin of 9.2% and its deleverage of 190 basis points. We expect the deleverage story for the full year is going to be very similar to what we talked about in Q1 and what I just said we kind of expect in Q2, significant deleverage caused by freight and supply chain costs some additional deleverage on the fixed cost base and all of that deleverage partially offset by substantial gross margin growth. So, that's kind of the whole picture."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will review our first quarter results. Secondly, I will discuss our outlook for Q2 and for the balance of the year. Thirdly, I will offer a few comments on the external real environment. And I will explain that while this environment may create near-term headwinds for us, we believe that it could drive longer term strategic benefits for our business. After that, I will hand the call over to John to walk through the financial details. Then we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let's talk about our results. Comparable store sales for the first quarter decreased 18%. In Q1 of last year, we achieved 20% comp store sales growth. We had estimated at the time that the federal stimulus checks have driven 10 to 15 points of this growth. As we developed our plan for Q1, we knew we were up against this headwind. So we planned the quarter at a mid-teens comp decline. We viewed this as a baseline that we would be able to beat. In fact, we missed this plan. As I will explain, this was largely self-inflicted. The root cause of this sales miss was that in-store inventory levels were too low and unbalanced in February and March. We had deliberately planned inventories down in Q1, but this backfired on us as we faced late deliveries and receipt churn early in the quarter. Let me explain what we were trying to do. In the past 12 to 18 months, we have reduced inventory levels significantly, providing greater flexibility and driving faster terms, more freshness and lower markdowns. We believe that we still have room to turn faster. So we reduced inventory levels further in Q1. We are also mindful of the fact that during the quarter we will be lapping the federal stimulus checks. So we felt that these lower inventory levels would provide additional flexibility. As I say, this completely backfired. In February, we experienced significant receipt delays. These created big gaps in our assortment, especially in our fastest trending businesses. And these assortment gaps critically impacted our sales trend. In March, we moved quickly to take up receipt and inventory levels. By early April, our in-store inventories were back up and in line with last year. Since then, our comp trend has improved. During this call, when describing our comp trend, I am going to use a 3-year geometric comp stack. This is just like a simple 3-year comp stack, but it accounts for the compounding effect of growth from year-to-year. Given our very large comp numbers last year, we believe that this geometric stack provides a more meaningful indicator of our multiyear trend. This metric is described in more detail in today's press release. In February, our 3-year geometric stack was minus 6%. In March, it was minus 2%. And in April, it was plus 5%. For Q1 as a whole, our 3-year geometric stack was minus 1%. Again, we are very unhappy with this result and we recognized that it was largely self-inflicted. Our trend in April suggests that if our inventories have been appropriate, since the start of the quarter and our comp performance could have been 6 points higher in Q1. One other point on this inventory issue and then I will move on. We have raised our inventory plans for the rest of the year so that in-store inventories will be in line to slightly higher than last year. We still believe that we have room to increase terms, but we will not go after this opportunity until global shipping issues and delays normalize. To be clear, inventory levels for the rest of this year are now planned to be in line to slightly above 2021, but this means they will still be well below historic levels. I am going to move on now to talk about Q2 and the outlook for the rest of the year. As I mentioned a moment ago, our 3-year geometric stack in April was plus 5%. Our May month-to-date trend has been consistent with April. That said, we think it is prudent to plan Q2 more cautiously than this trailing 2 months trend. So, we are planning Q2 based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single-digits. This implies a 1-year comp decline of minus 15% to minus 13%. This range compares with 19% comp growth in Q2 of 2021. There are two reasons why we are being cautious in planning Q2. Firstly, we are concerned about the economic environment and especially about the impact of inflation on retail spending. Lower income customers are under significant economic stress and it is not clear that this will change in the next few months. The second reason for caution is that it seems to us as if many retailers are overinventoried and overbought. We think that this could lead to a very promotional environment later in the quarter. This kind of environment tends to hurt our business. Let me move on to our guidance for the full year. Our updated guidance for the full year is based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. This implies a 1-year comp decline of minus 9% to minus 6%. This is up against a full year comp growth in 2021 of 15%. Our updated full year guidance does assume an uptick in the trend as we get into form. While we remain concerned about the external environment, there are a couple of factors that we think could provide a tailwind for us in the back half of the year. Firstly, there has been a sea change in the availability of off-price merchandise. We do not know if this has been driven by overproduction by vendors, a decline in the sales trend at other retailers, a sudden catch-up of supply or all of the above. But whatever the reasons, the buying environment now is better than it has been for years. Our buyers are seeing great deals. We have taken this opportunity to build our reserve inventory. At the end of Q1, our reserve was double the level of last year. If this buying environment persists, then we would expect our assortment to be more compelling with even stronger values. We know that in an environment where the customer really needs a deal, a more compelling, value-driven assortment can drive an improved sales trend. We expect that the buys we are making now could begin to have an impact in late summer. The second factor that could cause our sales trend to be higher is if shoppers begin to trade down looking for value. Clearly, there is a lot of focus and concern about the lower income customer right now. Based on recent results, it feels like the retail industry is bifurcated. Those retailers that serve lower income customers are experiencing a weaker sales trend, while retailers serving higher income shoppers are seeing stronger sales growth. But we think it's unlikely that the impact of inflation and the possible broader economic slowdown this year will be confined only to lower income shopper. We anticipate the high inflation, higher interest rates, falling stock market and a possible economic slowdown will at some point affect other income groups as well. If this happens, then we would expect to see a trade-down customer in our stores and this could drive stronger sales trend for our business in the back half of 2022. Let me recap. Our guidance for Q2 is based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single-digits. And our updated guidance for the full year is based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. This guidance feels appropriate given the risks and uncertainties. As a reminder, our inventory levels are in line with last year and we have a very strong reserve position. So, if the trend turns out to be stronger, then we should be well-positioned to chase it. In a moment, John will provide more financial details on our Q2 and rest of year guidance. But before we go there, I would like to provide some high level commentary on what we think might happen in the retail industry through the rest of this year. As I described a moment ago, we believe that the economic environment is likely to worsen this year and that this could further undermine the trend across the retail industry. We anticipate that if this happens, it is likely to create headaches and challenges for us in the short-term, but we believe that this slowdown could provide longer term benefits for our business. Many investors will remember that last summer we began to callout that 2022 could be a very difficult and turbulent year across the retail industry. At the time, we characterized the strong trend across retail as something above sugar high, driven by a combination of government support programs and pent-up demand as the consumer emerge from the pandemic. This sugar high drove higher sales and for some retailers higher margins than they would otherwise have been able to achieve. This sales trend was always going to be difficult to anniversary. What we did not anticipate last summer was that there would be other factors that would further undermine retail spending, specifically, the impact of inflation on lower income shoppers and potentially fallout from a broader economic slowdown. The important point to make is the difficult and turbulent times in retail are almost always in the long run, good for off-price. Historically, this has been the cycle. Make no mistake, a slowdown in retail spending makes life difficult for us in the short-term. We are certainly feeling that. But as an off-price retailer, we can adapt to the new trend. We can benefit from the loosening of supply. And in the coming quarters, we may be able to drive our sales trend by appealing to the trade-down customer. In addition, we believe that difficult and turbulent times in retail sooner or later will drive further rationalization of full-price bricks-and-mortar stores. We do not know if or when this might happen, but if it does, then it could represent a very important strategic tailwind to the off-price retail channel. Now, I would like to turn the call over to John who will share more details on our first quarter financial performance as well as our outlook for fiscal 2022. John? Before we move on to questions, let me summarize some of the key points that we have covered this morning. Coming into Q1, we anticipated a difficult sales trend as we lapped the impact of the stimulus payments from last year. We planned accordingly, but we missed this plan because our inventory levels were low and unbalanced early in the quarter. This issue was largely self-inflicted. Once we got our inventories in shape in early April, our trend improved significantly. That said, our sales trend remains weak, and we're concerned about economic headwinds. We are planning Q2 based on a 3-year geometric stack in the low single digits. And we have updated the full year based on a 3-year geometric stack of 5% to 8%. We anticipate that 2020 could be a disruptive and turbulent year across retail. If this happens, then it would create challenges for us in the short-term. But our assessment is that in the past, disruptive and turbulent times in retail have almost always in the long run, being good for the off-price channel. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Matt, thanks for the question. I think that my answer is going to sound a little counterintuitive, and I recognize given our disappointing Q1 results, I need to offer this answer with a huge dose of humility. But we think that the external conditions that we're seeing now and that we're likely to see in the upcoming quarters could present a major opportunity for our business. Now last year, there were several investors who asked me to describe what would an ideal environment look like for our business in 2022. And you should file this on the \u2013 be careful what you wish for because my response was that the best scenario for us would be, number one, a dramatic slowdown in the sales trend across retail, leading to significant expansion of off-price supply with really great buying opportunities, and also leading to downward pressure on expenses, especially in freight rates. And then secondly, a much sharper consumer focus on merchandise value. Look, we're not completely in this scenario yet, but there are signs that, that could be where we're headed. I think you can see aspects of this scenario and what's going on right now. And if the full economy starts to slow down in the coming months, then this could lead, we think, to a further weakening in the sales trend across retail a further increase in supply, downward pressure on expenses and a heightened focus on value. Now last year, at the time I was describing that scenario, I can see it that those conditions would also make life difficult for us for a period of time. But we're not immune to an economic difficulties. But we know that we can adapt, and we know we can take advantage of these circumstances in a way that other retail models cannot. Everything we've been doing on Burlington 2.0 is aimed at improving our ability to offer great value to our customers and making us more flexible, so we can react to changes in trend or supply. So again, again, I say this with some humility given our Q1 results, but we believe that the current conditions in the upcoming quarters could present a big opportunity for us. Yes. So it's a good question. As I said in the prepared remarks, there has been a complete sea change in terms of merchandise availability. We're seeing availability now in categories where supply has really been on trend for a long time. And we're seeing brands that we haven't seen for a couple of years. As this increase in supply has been pretty broad-based, seasonal basics, apparel, home accessories we've been able to make some great deals. Now when you buy a large amount of merchandise in a short period, it can't all flow to stores at once. So, many of those deals have gone into reserve. And we will release those over the next few months. On the part of your question about what's driven the increase in supply, I suspect it's a number of things. I think that many retailers and vendors overordered and overproduced versus what they are now seeing in their sales trends. Also, I think that retailers and vendors probably built in a cushion to their orders to account for shipping delays and those shipping delays have now eased, so they have too much merchandise. And finally, the mix of merchandise that the consumer is buying has really shifted. And I think that's taken some vendors by surprise. So there are some categories where there is now what I would call a glut of supply. I think the final part of your question was, will it last? And we don't know. If the economy weakens, then we could see even more merchandise sustainability. The other complicating factor though is the COVID situation in China. It's hard to know what impact the recent shutdowns there could have. But they could create shortages later in the year. That's possible. But on the other hand, if vendors overcompensate then they could add to merchandise availability, we will have to see. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Good morning, Ike, thanks for the question. As you say, we've been quite wary about taking up at retail prices. Our view has been that well, our view with the retail prices rose across the industry last year, mainly because consumer demand exceeded supply. And our concern was always what happens when that reverses. And that's kind of what's happening now, the supply of merchandise in most of the categories we compete in has now outgrown demand. So sooner or later, we would expect that, that will pressure retail prices. And in the earlier comments, we made the point that at the end of Q2, so the end of the spring season, we think that the retail environment could get a lot more promotional as retailers try and clear their spring merchandise. But with that said, we also recognized that the underlying costs of products are now permanently higher, some of those higher freights and supply chain costs aren't going away. And for us that means that retail has even promoted prices \u2013 even promoted retail prices, are unlikely to ever go back to their 2019 levels. So we think that means that there is now a permanently higher price umbrella. And that's why we see some potential to hedge up our own prices even in this environment. Now we've developed \u2013 I think on the last call, we explained that we've developed a plan to raise retails really in the back half of 2022. And that plan is very carefully focused on businesses where we believe we have \u2013 where we have that opportunity. But we recognize in this environment, there are risks. So we're going to be careful, and we're going to make adjustments to the plan as we go along. There is one other point that I think is worth making at, I think we should \u2013 it's probably a good idea to change the vocabulary on this topic. Our primary motivation here is not to take up retail prices. Our primary motivation that Burlington is to take up merchant margins, if we can increase merchant margins, then that will offset higher freight and supply chain expenses, raising retail prices is just one way, the most obvious way, to drive up merchant margin. But there are two other important levers that our merchants are focused on right now. Firstly, as off-price supply \u2013 off-price merchandise supply has opened up, we started to see better deals. In other words, we're paying less for goods. In some situations, we will plan to pass on some of that value to consumers. But in other situations, we may use it to capture margin. Secondly, we're making changes to the merchandise mix, largely based on what the customer is telling us. The customer is shifting in terms of the type of merchandise that they are interested in buying. And many of those changes will also naturally drive a higher margin. So let me wrap up. Yes, we believe there is an opportunity \u2013 we still believe there is an opportunity to raise retails, but we're going to be careful, and we're going to make sure whatever we do, we still offer a really differentiated value versus other retailers. And at the same time we're going to aggressively go after other opportunities to drive up higher merchant margin. Thanks, Ike. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Good to hear from you. Yes. As I said \u2013 actually, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are very disappointed about Q1. We know we should have done better. And we recognize that we were the architects of our own downfall in the quarter. But with that said, let me offer a more full-bodied explanation of what happened and what we were trying to do. And I think the best starting point is that we believed, rightly so turned out, that 2022 would be a difficult and unpredictable year in retail. And as you have heard us say in the past, our strategy for dealing with uncertainty and our playbook, if you like, is to be as nimble and flexible as possible. And that's really a core principle behind Burlington 2.0. So, with that in mind, when we planned 2022, we tried to do three things. First of all, we planned sales conservatively. Now we are happy that we did this. It's clear it was the right thing to do. It looks like many other retailers were more optimistic. And as a result, they are now over-bought and over-inventory, and we are not. That means that we have a bit more flexibility to respond to buying opportunities. And secondly, in addition to spending conservatively, we planned our liquidity very tightly. For example, this means that we still have open to buy for the second quarter and the rest of the year. And again, that just gives us more flexibility given the current external environment. Now the third thing we did, and this is the one that goes to the heart of your question, we have planned our inventories conservatively. We believe we can turn faster. And these plans were, again, intended to increase our flexibility. Now, as I said in the remarks, this did not work. In fact, instead of providing flexibility, these leaner inventories meant that we were exposed when the receipts did not show up early in Q1. This was a mistake and [indiscernible]. Let me move on to the last part of your question, have the receipt delays improved since February, the answer is yes, they have. The situation has completely changed. Just a few months ago, many vendors we are living hand to mouth. Their warehouses were empty, and they were literally just in time, waiting for merchandise to get through the ports. Now, a few months later, domestic warehouses are full. And in many cases, they are backing up. So, in this situation, the vendors really want to get the goods or as soon as possible. So, as you would expect shipping delays have fallen off dramatically. Sure. Well, good morning John. I would say, compared to many retailers, I would characterize our core customer demographics as younger, more ethnically diverse and larger family size and low to moderate income. And I would say that we were got those as wonderful demographics. This segment of the population is growing and understands value. And in many ways, populate that customer group represents everything that's growing in America. So \u2013 and in fact, for many years, I think low to moderate income shoppers have been the growth engine, not just for us but for value retail as a whole, especially bricks-and-mortar value retail. Of course, as you say, this customer the low-to-moderate income customer is under a lot of pressure right now, that makes sense. In 2021, certainly in proportion to their income, these shoppers were big beneficiaries of government support programs, stimulus checks, child benefit, extended unemployment \u2013 and those programs have now gone. That alone would have made 2022 a difficult year. But if you layer on top of that, retail price inflation for essential items like food and gas is now running at extraordinarily high levels. And again, those items represent a disproportionate share of household budgets for those shoppers. So, it's not difficult to see why the customer is under significant economic stress. Now, what can we share, well, we see this in our own data. The vast majority of our stores are in trade areas that have average how household income below $75,000, so the vast majority of our stores. And in 2021, our stores that are in low to moderate income areas had, by far, the strongest increase in comp sales across our chain. And this year, quite surprisingly, this year, they have shown biggest deceleration. Now in the short-term, we don't expect that the economic conditions to these consumers is going to improve in the short-term. But we do think it's a big opportunity for us. These shoppers need value now more than ever. And in the coming quarters, we think we can do a much better job of delivering that value. Let me wrap up my answer by reinforcing the point that these customers are the future yes, right now, they are facing headwinds, and those headwinds are likely to persist for the next few quarters. But this is a large demographic group, and these customers are coming back. In the coming years, we believe that this will again be a major source of growth for value retail, especially bricks-and-mortar value retail. Yes, it's a good question. I don't think we have seen much of a trade-down customer so far. But we do think that in the back half of this year, that could change \u2013 and that's why we are actually a little more optimistic about the back half of the year, and we have got in an element of that to our guidance. Yes, a moment ago, I said that it makes sense that the lower income customer is struggling. But we don't believe that that's \u2013 this is where the economic stress is going to end. I think it's possible that we are only in the opening stages of this economy. We don't have a crystal ball, but it seems likely to us that high inflation, higher interest rates, falling stock market and a potential recession, it is going to affect a much broader set of consumers at some point. And when those consumers are squeezed, we think that they, too, will be looking for value and that they may break down. And historically, that is typically what has happened. Whenever there has been a broader economic slowdown, it hasn't just affected low income shoppers, it's also affected the mid-low and some higher end shoppers. In that situation, everyone cares about value. So, again, we don't know when this might happen, but if it does, then we believe that it may help drive our sales trend. Well, good morning Kim. So, the first part of your question, how are we feeling about the assortment right now, in terms of quantity, the overall level of inventory, I would say we feel very good. Our industry right now just a little bit higher than last year. And last year, as a reminder, in the second quarter, we made 19% comp. So, I feel pretty good about our entry level right now. The quality and the content, I feel good about the quality of the content of our inventory and our assortment. But I would say that we recognize there is actually huge opportunity to take it from good to great. We actually think that \u2013 there is a lot of opportunities to make our assortment much better than it is. The starting point is good, but I think we can make it much better. And the reason I say that is there are a couple of things that have happened in the past month or so \u2013 the first is, I really do think it's become clear that the customer has shifted in terms of the categories that they are buying right now. And some of this is intuitive. Last year, the hottest trending categories were home, active apparel, casual apparel basics. This year, the customer has pivoted. They are interested in dressier, classifications, back to office, career-wear, much more structured apparel, woven versus mix. And we had anticipated some of that, but it's happening to an even greater extent than we anticipated. So, I think we have an opportunity to shift our assortment more in that direction. And then secondly, the other thing that's really happened over the past couple of months is just this point about merchandise availability has opened up, and there are really great deals out there. Now as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, when you see great deals out there, you can't just buy everything and flow it to stores straight away. You need to sort of flow into stores over a period of time. So, it takes a while for it to bleed into your assortment. But over the next few quarters, I really think we are going to have greater value in our assortment, much more compelling values. So, we are very excited about that. Now, the second part of your question, I think was about are we in a position to chase. And I think the answer is yes, we feel really good about the case right now, partly because obviously, our inventory level is already at a pretty good point. But secondly, we have a lot of merchandise in reserve that we can pull on. And then, as I say, much nicer availability in terms of going out there now and buying merchandise that we can flow to stores has also improved. So, we feel good about our ability to chase in the second quarter of the sales and runs ahead. And on our timely deliveries of receipts, Again, that's completely changed during the last couple of months, the situation in terms of the amount of merchandise that's now in the country, and that's been imported into the country over the past few months, means that domestic warehouses are pretty full. And as a result, our vendors are shipping on time because they want to get those goods out of their warehouse three months or four months ago, their warehouses were acting and they are waiting for goods to come out of the port. So, as I said, that's completely changed in the couple of months. Thanks Kim. Sure. Yes, it's a good question, Chuck. We have been thinking about that. I would say that obviously, the previous economic slowdown as the most \u2013 maybe the most applicable is the financial crisis in 2008. But I would say that the one difference between what happened then and what's happening now is in 2008, the financial crisis kind of came as a shock to the whole economy all at once. Like, in September of 2008, it was kind of \u2013 it was felt across the whole economy. And then that sort of then led into what happened in 2009 and 2010. So, like here in 2022, this is a little bit different and that the inflation impact, please to begin with is being felt more by low-income customers. They are the ones facing immediate shock because when you look at the cost of gas prices and food, those items represent such a big share of their wallet that the big increases we have seen in those areas are really hitting those customers most of all. But as I said in my earlier remarks, we don't think it's going to stop there. I think the impact on the overall economy is coming. It's ahead of us. Now, we could be wrong, but that seems to us to be likely. And therefore, it seems to me that the trade-down customer, which might be more evident back in 2008 and more evident earlier, might take a little bit longer this time around. But we don't really know, but that's how I would compare it with previous economic slowdowns. Thanks Chuck. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you for your time today."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Burlington Stores Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Glick, Group Senior Vice President. David, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's conference call to discuss Burlington's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter operating results.  Unless otherwise indicated, our discussion and results for the 2023 fourth quarter and full year are on a 13 or 52-week adjusted basis and exclude the impact of certain expenses associated with the acquisition of Bed Bath & Beyond leases.

And thank you for joining us.  I would like to cover four topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our fourth quarter results. Secondly, I will comment on our full-year 2023 results. Thirdly, I will talk about our guidance for the year ahead. And finally, I will offer some longer term commentary. Then, Kristin will provide some additional financial details.  Okay. Let's talk about our Q4 results. Comp store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2% on a 13-week basis. This was above our guidance of minus 2% to flat.  I would like to peel back the onion a little and describe some important aspects of this fourth quarter comp performance. Firstly, we continue to see strong selling at our opening price points. The lower income customer, the need a deal shopper, is responding well to these values. This is a very important customer for us. A year ago, this shopper was really struggling with a higher cost of living and with the loss of pandemic era benefits. This customer is still fragile. The cost of living is not declining. It is just going up less quickly. That said, this represents an improvement versus last year and it may have helped to underpin our comp in Q4.  Secondly, what really drove our incremental comp growth in Q4 was the success of our strategies and businesses targeting trade downs or slightly higher income shoppers. These customers responded well with a higher mix of recognizable brands in our apparel and accessories businesses. These shoppers also grow very strong selling across our key holiday categories in gifting, accessories and home decor.  Frankly though, looking at the results of our peers, I am disappointed that we didn't drive stronger comp growth with these shoppers. There is clearly a bigger opportunity. The implication is that we have to offer stronger and even more compelling values on the brands and styles that these trade down shoppers are looking for.  The final point I would like to make about our Q4 results is that we saw strong selling on regular priced merchandise. In Q4, the merchandise in our stores turned faster and we ended up with less clearance inventory.  Our comp selling on clearance merchandise was down double digits. If I strip this out from our overall Q4 comp growth, in other words, if we just look at comp sales growth on regular priced merchandise, it was up 4%. This is very healthy. Later on, Kristin will talk about the impact that this strong regular price selling had on our merchandise margin.  Wrapping up my comments on our Q4 comp performance, we are happy that we beat guidance, but more importantly we see some clear opportunities to drive even stronger performance.  I would like to move off Q4 now. In fact, I would like to step back and provide a report card, if you will, for our full year 2023 performance. In 2023, our total sales grew by 10%. We believe that total sales is the best proxy indicator on what is happening with market share. This total sales growth was driven by 4% comp growth plus 80 net new store openings.  As I look back on these numbers, candidly, we would have liked to have done more. Let's start with new stores. In 2023, we opened 80 net new stores, but our goal over the last couple of years has been to ramp up to 100 net new stores a year. We have rigorous standards for the quality of new store locations, and over the last couple of years, this has made it difficult to hit this 100 store run rate.  That said, 2023 was a breakthrough year for our new store program. In the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy process, we acquired a large number of very attractive new store locations, and we identified and are negotiating on many others with the landlords. These deals have significantly strengthened our new store pipeline, and as we will discuss later, we are confident that we will hit our goal of 100 net new stores in 2024.  Okay, let me turn now to comp sales growth. For the full year 2023, we achieved comp growth of 4%. This was right in the middle of our original guidance range of 3% to 5%. But frankly, coming into 2023, we had hoped for better. There were external and internal factors that slowed us down in the first half of the year.  Externally, our core low income shopper continued to struggle with lower government benefits and with the rising cost of living. We did see some growth in trade down traffic from want-a-deal higher-income customers, but in Q1 and Q2, this was not enough to offset weakness with our core low income shoppers.  Internally, we had planned for a stronger trend at the start of the year. This hurt us because when the trend turned out to be weaker, we struggled to reposition ourselves. In retrospect, it would have been better to have had a lower sales plan and more liquidity. The Q1 trend would still have been solved, but we could have better positioned ourselves for Q2. In any event, by the second half, we were able to get ourselves in shape and to build momentum, beating our sales plan for the full season. Okay, the final section of the 2023 report card is earnings. We were able to drive 130 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023. This was ahead of our original guidance of 80 to 120 basis points. This helped to drive EPS growth of 46%, well ahead of guidance.  In a few moments, Kristin will dissect these results, but the headline is, this was a high quality earnings beat, driven by stronger merchandise margins and faster-than-expected progress on our major expense initiatives in freight and supply chains.  So, wrapping up on the 2023 report card, yes, we would have liked to have done more, but overall, we are happy with our double-digit total sales growth, 80 net new stores, 4% comp sales growth, and 130 basis points of operating margin expansion. These results give us confidence in the long-range financial targets that we shared on our November call.  Now, let's move on to 2024 and talk about our guidance. Of course, we previewed this guidance in November. Back then, we described our forecast as being based on 2% comp growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. Since then, we have built flexibility into the lower end of the range to give ourselves more room to chase. But to be clear, nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our thinking on the 2024 outlook.  I would like to discuss each driver of this guidance, new stores, comp stores, and operating margin expansion. In 2024, we expect to open approximately 140 gross new stores. Stripping out relocation and closures, this should result in 100 net new stores. We anticipate approximately one-third of these will open in the spring and two-thirds in the fall.  As discussed previously, new stores average about $7 million in volume in their first full year. These new store openings, together with our comp sales growth, should drive a total sales increase in the range of 9% to 11% this year.  Moving on to comp sales. For the full year and for Q1, we are guiding to 0% to 2% comp growth. As discussed in November, there is plenty of uncertainty in the outlook for 2024, so it makes sense to be cautious. As an off-price retailer, this allows us to manage our business and position ourselves to chase a stronger trend.  As I described a moment ago, one of the lessons from the spring of 2023 is that we came into the year with too strong of a plan. When the trend turned out to be weaker, in some of our businesses, we were not liquid enough to react. It would have been better if we had had a lower plan and then chased.  Moving on to margin. With our comp range of flat to 2%, we expect to be able to drive operating margin expansion of 10 basis points to 50 basis points. There are three drivers of this margin expansion. Higher merchant margin, lower freight expenses, and lower supply chain expenses. Kristin will talk more about these, but we feel good about the underlying plans we have in each of these areas.  Kristin will also explain that we expect this margin expansion to be slightly higher in Q1, 20 basis points to 60 basis points on a flat to 2% comp.  Let me wrap up now with a few comments on our longer term outlook. In our November call, we discussed our expectations for the growth of our business over the next five years. We believe we can grow total sales to approximately $16 billion and operating income to about $1.6 billion over this period.  We see three drivers of this growth. I will comment on each of these. New store openings and relocations \u2013 we expect to open about 100 net new stores a year, plus two to three dozen relocations of older, oversized, less productive stores.  As I described a moment ago, we are well positioned for 2024. Looking further out, we anticipate some lumpiness in the number of openings year to year. But, overall, we feel good about our longer term pipeline and the likely availability of attractive new store locations over the next few years.  Secondly, comp sales growth. There are good reasons to be cautious in how we plan and manage our business in the short term, especially the year ahead. But over the next five years, we believe we can achieve average comp growth in the mid-single-digits.  We think the external environment over the next few years is likely to be favorable for off price, and we are excited about the initiatives we have been pursuing to improve our own execution of the model.  Thirdly, margins. We believe we can grow our operating margins to 10% in the next five years from a combination of leverage on higher sales and cost savings opportunities that are unrelated to sales. We made good progress in 2023, and we are confident in our plans for 2024.  At this point, I would like to ask Kristin to share additional financial details on Q4 and on our first quarter 2024 and full year guidance.\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you, Michael. And good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional details on the fourth quarter. Please note that the following discussion of fourth quarter financial results will be on a 13-week non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise indicated.  Total sales growth in the quarter was 9%. This was higher than our guidance of 5% to 7%, driven by higher comp store sales. Our comp sales growth in Q4 was 2%, which was above our guidance of minus 2% to flat. In addition, the 53rd week added $138 million in total sales to this result, bringing our Q4 total sales increase on a 14-week basis to approximately 14%.  The gross margin rate for the fourth quarter was 42 .6%, an increase of 190 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 140 basis point increase in merchandise margins, mostly driven by lower markdowns, as well as a 50 basis point decrease in freight expense.  Product sourcing costs were 20 basis points lower than last year. This was driven by supply chain leverage of 40 basis points, as we've made progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. This supply chain leverage was partially offset by higher incentive compensation.  Adjusted SG&A costs in Q4 were 100 basis points higher than last year, which included 20 basis points of deleverage attributable to expenses related to the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding Bed Bath & Beyond leases, adjusted SG&A deleverage was 80 basis points, driven primarily by higher incentive comp accruals and investments in store payroll.  Q4 adjusted EBIT margin was 11.1%, 110 basis points higher than last year, compared with guidance of 0 to 40 basis points. Again, this excludes Bed Bath & Beyond costs worth 20 basis points.  Our adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.69. This was well above the high end of our range of $3.10 to $3.25. This result and the guidance range exclude approximately $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were acquired last fall. On a 14-week basis, our adjusted EPS was $3.72, again excluding $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores.  At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 5% below 2022, while our reserve inventory was 39% of our total inventory versus 48% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve.  We ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position, with approximately $1.6 billion in total liquidity, which consisted of $925 million in cash and $709 million in availability in our ABL. We had no borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter on our ABL.  During the quarter, we repurchased $103 million in common stock, bringing our annual share repurchases to $232 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $500 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in 2025.  In Q4, we opened 30 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 1,007 stores. This included 39 new store openings, 4 relocations, and 5 closings. For the full year, we opened 104 new stores, while relocating 13 stores and closing 11 stores, adding 80 net new stores to our fleet.  I will now move on to discuss our full-year 2023 results. Please note that the following discussion of fiscal 2023 financial results will be on a 52-week non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, the full year results I will share exclude the impact of approximately $18 million in expenses related to the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. In fiscal 2023, total sales increased 10% and comp store sales increased 4%. Our operating margin for the full year expanded by 130 basis points. Merchandise margin increased by 110 basis points, while freight improved by 90 basis points, which more than offset 40 basis points of deleverage in SG&A and 20 basis points of deleverage in product sourcing costs.  Let's now move to 2024 guidance. I will compare 2024 guidance to 2023 results on a 52-week basis. Also, this 2024 guidance excludes an anticipated $9 million in expenses associated with the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. $8 million of these expenses are expected in the first quarter and $1 million in the second quarter.  For the 2024 fiscal year, we expect total sales growth in the range of 9% to 11%. We expect comp store sales to increase in the range of 0% to 2% for fiscal 2024, and our adjusted EBIT margin to increase 10 to 50 basis points versus last year. We expect higher merchandise margins, as well as freight and supply chain leverage to be the primary margin drivers in fiscal 2024. Keep in mind that we will be reporting comparable store sales in fiscal 2024 on a shifted basis, lining up the comparable weeks in fiscal 2023.  Capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances, are expected to be approximately $750 million in fiscal 2024. This results in adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $7 to $7.60, an expected increase of 12% to 22%.  For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total sales growth in the range of 9% to 11%. Comp store sales are assumed to increase between 0% and 2%.  We are expecting adjusted EBIT margin to increase in the range of 20 to 60 basis points over the first quarter of 2023, which result in an adjusted EPS outlook in the range of $0.95 to $1.10 in the first quarter. Again, we expect merchandise margin scrapes and supply chain leverage to be the primary drivers of this anticipated margin improvement.  I will now turn the call back to Michael. \nMichael O'Sullivan : Thank you, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed. We are happy that we beat our comp guidance for the fourth quarter. But the more important takeaway from the quarter is that we have the opportunity to drive even stronger performance, especially by delivering stronger and more compelling value to trade down shoppers.  Stepping back and looking at 2023 as a whole, we would have liked to have done more. But, overall, we are happy with our double-digit total sales growth, 80 net new stores, 4% comp growth, and 130 basis points of margin expansion.  As we look ahead to 2024, there is plenty of uncertainty, and we see good reasons to be cautious. We are guiding 9% to 11% total sales growth, driven by 100 net new stores and 0% to 2% comp growth. With this sales growth, we anticipate margin expansion of 10 basis points to 50 basis points.  Lastly, we are very excited about the long-term prospects for our business. As we discussed in November, we think that, over the next five years, we can grow sales to $16 billion and drive our operating earnings to approximately $1.6 billion.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.\nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a really nice quarter. Michael, maybe to start off, could you elaborate on the rationale behind your 2024 comp sales guidance and just how we should think about this guidance in relation to your long-term target, which calls for mid-single digit comps on average over the next five years? \nMichael O'Sullivan: It's a good question. Let me start by putting 2024 into context with the last three years. If I go back to 2021, our trend was extraordinarily strong, stronger than peers, fueled by the impact of pandemic era benefits on our poor, lower income shoppers. Then in 2022, we came back down to earth with a bump as those shoppers were crushed by lower benefits and by big increases in their cost of living. Now those issues continue to bleed into the first half of 2023.  So here we are, what to expect in 2024? I'm going to whisper this, but we think it's possible that 2024 could be the first full normal year since I joined Burlington in 2019. And that's kind of how we approached guidance for 2020.  In normal times, before the pandemic, we would likely have planned a low single-digit comp and then been ready to chase. Of course, we don't know if the trend in 2024 will be stronger or weaker. There is plenty of economic uncertainty, interest rates, inflation, gas prices, as well as political and geopolitical risks even.  But by planning 0% to 2% comp, we're positioning ourselves to react, I think, to an appropriate range of outcomes. If the trend is weaker than 2%, we can pull back and absorb it. If it's stronger than 2%, then we know we could chase it. I should add, in Q4, as we've just reported, we grew 2% comp versus last year, so that gives us some confidence that our 2024 guidance is reasonable.  The key part of your question was about our longer-term outlook, so let me try and reconcile our 2024 guidance to a longer range target of mid-single-digit comp growth. In the years leading up to the pandemic, although we might have planned low-single-digit comp, the intent was always to chase above that. And measured over multiple years, our comp indeed averaged 3% to 4%.  But we think that, as the after effects of the pandemic continue to recede, that's the right baseline for our longer term model. We believe all the underlying consumer, competitive and structural factors that drove that growth still exist.  But, in addition, we know that we've taken significant actions to improve our own execution of the off-price model. And as those actions gain traction, we expect to outperform that 3% to 4% baseline. So, if I pull all this together, for the 12 months ahead, for 2024, our plan is based on low-single-digit comp growth with the potential to chase.  In future years, I should add, it will likely take a similar approach, and I expect in some years, we'll chase and beat that number. In other years, we won't. But we believe over an extended period, a five-year period, we will be able to achieve average annual comp growth in the mid-single-digits. \nMatthew Boss: Kristin, maybe to follow up on the 2024 margin guide, could you just walk us through some of the puts and takes in this year's guidance and, maybe more specifically, could walk through the drivers of leverage on a flat to 2% comp for this year?\nKristin Wolfe: The margin drivers for 2024 are consistent with what we shared on the November call. That's higher merchandise margin and savings and freight and in supply chain. And these three margin drives are not dependent on sales, which is why we believe we can increase our EBIT margin on a flat to 2% comp by 10 to 50 basis points.  So let me go through each of these quickly. I'll start with merchandise margin. We continue to make good progress here, as evidenced by the 110 basis point increase in merchandise margin in fiscal 2023. We continue to believe we can turn faster and drive lower markdown. And as in 2024, we're entering with clearance levels down meaningfully versus last year, and our inventory levels and assortments are well-transitioned, are fresh, and with great values.  Secondly, on freight, freight continues to be a tailwind for us, particularly in the first half of 2024. We're benefiting from lower contracted domestic rates and remain largely covered with our contracts on ocean freight rates.  And finally, we're making good progress on supply chain expenses, as evidenced by the 40 basis points of leverage we drove in the fourth quarter. I would say these are the three line items that are the primary drivers of leverage in 2024.  There are two offsets that we're planning for in 2024 that I want to mention. One is SG&A. We do expect some modest deleverage in SG&A due to continued investment in store payroll, which we really didn't step up into the back half of 2023. In addition, we'd expect some deleverage on a 0% to 2% comp in SG&A, given that range.  And the second offset is in depreciation. We're planning for some modest deleverage in depreciation, given the step-up in CapEx we're planning for this year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Congrats on the quarter. Kristin, I guess first for you, you guys ended up with really nice margins in the fourth quarter and the full year. I guess how much of the upside do you consider to be one-time in any way? In other words, how much of this upside would stick on a go-forward P&L? And I have a follow-up for Michael. \nKristin Wolfe: We didn't provide line item guidance for the fourth quarter, so let me provide some color. The first thing I would say is there were not any, what I would consider, one-time benefits. In fact, we faced a margin headwind given the higher accrued incentive comp expense versus the fourth quarter of 2022.  So when I look at our Q4 margin, I feel good about the quality of the upside. Starting with gross margin, that increased 190 basis points. Freight came in largely as we had expected at 50 basis points lower, but the 140 basis point increase in merchandise margin was very healthy and better than we planned. As Michael highlighted in his prepared remarks, strong regular price selling did help drive lower markdowns than in turn a higher merchandise margin.  Within product sourcing costs, as I just mentioned, supply chain leveraged 40 basis points. That was ahead of our expectations, and that was due to higher productivity and benefits we're starting to realize from our efficiency initiatives and supply chain.  SG&A in the fourth quarter did delever by 80 basis points. Now, that excludes the Bed Bath & Beyond expenses. But that was in line with what we had expected and was driven primarily by higher incentive comp, as well as our store payroll investment during the quarter.  So, overall, for the fourth quarter, our 110 basis point increase in EBIT margin, that was 70 basis points above the high end of our guidance. We felt like this was a strong outcome, gives us confidence as we head into 2024, continue to expand operating margin.  And finally, the strength of Q4 did contribute to the 130 basis point increase in EBIT margin for the full year fiscal 2023. And that enabled us to ultimately exceed the high end of that original EBIT margin guidance for 120 basis point increase in fiscal 2023. \nIke Boruchow: Just a quick one for Michael. Just on real estate, you still sound very confident on 100 net new stores for 2024. You mentioned some things like lumpiness in openings over the next couple of years. I wonder if you could maybe just elaborate a little bit on that and maybe just update us on the overall real estate environment and what your pipeline looks like. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Let me anchor my answer on the gross number of new store openings. We expect to open about 140 new stores on a gross basis this year. That includes relocating a couple of dozen of our older, oversized, less productive stores.  As we've described previously, that program of relocations is pretty important. It's going to be important to us in the next few years as we reposition ourselves away from some of our less attractive legacy real estate.  Anyway, if you take 140 gross new stores and remove those relocations and remove any closures, then we expect our incremental number of new stores to net down to about 100. As I said in the prepared remarks, we have high standards and tight controls for the quality of the real estate where we open new stores. Each potential location is analyzed carefully based on the traffic, trade area, demographics, and co-tenants. And based upon those detailed characteristics, we feel pretty excited about the new stores that we're planning to open this year.  Now beyond this year, it's a little difficult to get specific, but I'd offer up a couple of comments. We typically manage our new store pipeline two to three years out. So we still have plenty of work to do on our 2025 new store pipeline, but so far I would say it's shaping up well.  It includes a number of additional former Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we didn't pursue directly during the bankruptcy process, but instead have negotiated directly with the underlying landlords. And we're excited about those locations.  Beyond 2025, the pipeline is going to depend on the availability of attractive real estate locations. Again, difficult to be specific, but given the weak outlook across bricks and mortar retail, there are reasons to think that that availability could be fairly strong. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Hutchinson: Michael, can you give us more color on what you see as the opportunity with the trade down or that slightly higher income customer? I'm interested in how you're thinking about that opportunity and the actions you're taking to address it. \nMichael O'Sullivan: I would say that historically in off price, and certainly for us, the lower income shopper has been, A, or even B, major driver of growth. But since early 2022, that has not been the case. In fact, I would say that, for the last few years, it's been clear that right now the growth in off price is being driven by higher income shoppers. That's not a new revelation. We talked about that last year.  In 2023, especially in the fall, we pursued a number of strategies to go after those shoppers, in particular focused on delivering a higher mix of recognizable brands and on elevating our assortments in specific businesses. Those strategies worked. They worked really well. But looking back, we could see that we could/should maybe have been even more aggressive.  Many of the areas that I'm talking about require that you make buying commitments well ahead of time. In other words, it's more difficult to chase in some of those businesses. And that means that you have to commit further out. And that means you have to be prepared to take more risk. So although I'm happy with the success of the strategies we pursued, in retrospect, I think we should have leaned in more. We should have taken a little more risk. And we might have ended up actually with a slightly lower margin, but we could have driven more sales.  So as we look at 2024, we see that as an opportunity. Again, the lead times are a little longer for many of those brands and those businesses. So I would say the opportunity is likely to be stronger in the second half versus the first.  I guess the last thing I would say is that we have always had a lower mix of higher income shoppers than some of our peers. We know this. It's partly a reflection of where our stores are located.  I think we've shared before that about 70% of our stores are in trade areas where the mean household income is less than $80 ,000. That footprint is not going to change in the short term. But what 2023 demonstrated is that we have enough higher income shoppers coming into our stores, but we can drive incremental sales if we offer great value on the recognizable brands, styles, and items that they are looking for. So we're going to go after that business much more aggressively in 2024. \nLorraine Hutchinson: Kristin, in November, you had mentioned that you expect CapEx to be elevated over the next few years. Can you walk us through the uses on capital spend in 2024? \nKristin Wolfe: Our CapEx plan for 2024 is $750 million, which is about 7% of sales. And most of that investment is in our stores and supply chain as we're stepping up investments to support accelerated new store growth, as well as the expansion of our distribution center network to support our larger store base.  Let me provide a little bit more color on these two main drivers. So starting with stores, as Michael mentioned, we're planning to open 100 net new stores, close or relocate about 40 stores. So that's approximately 140 gross new stores.  This is well above the level we've opened the last few years and actually the highest number of stores we've opened in our history in a year. Our store CapEx represents about 45% of the CapEx spend in 2024.  Secondly, on supply chain, supply chain CapEx is about 30% of our CapEx spend. The big driver of our CapEx spend in supply chain is the material handling equipment that will go into our state-of-the-art 2 million square foot DC opening in the southeast in 2026. That's about twice the size of our next largest DC and will be designed and built for our off-price business, be highly automated and more productive than any DC in our current network. These incremental investments in new stores and supply chain capacity are really what's driving the step up in CapEx this year and in the next few years. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Kristin, it's encouraging freight and supply chain are now sources of margin improvement. They've been a source of pressure the past few years. Are you making faster progress here than you expected on those two line items? How do we think about the potential improvement on freight and supply chain in your 2024 guidance? And just what's the long-term. magnitude of the margin amount here. \nKristin Wolfe: I'll take you through these separately starting with freight. In fiscal 2023, freight leveraged 90 basis points. Those savings were driven by lower freight rates, but also specific transportation initiatives we have to optimize our outbound and inbound processes.  We still expect freight to be a contributor to our margin expansion in fiscal 2024 as we anniversary lower freight rates in the first part of the year and we continue to drive efficiencies across transportation.  There has been some limited pressure on ocean freight on certain routes, but we do not see significant risk to our ocean freight and that's embedded in our merchandise margin. Domestic freight represents a significant majority of our freight expense and we continue to see some opportunity to bring that expense lower as we plan.  On supply chain, in the fourth quarter, I think I mentioned, supply chain cost leveraged 40 basis points compared to last year. And the efficiency initiatives that drove that that we previously discussed to reduce labor hours and processing reserve to more efficiently manage the flow of goods and minimize number of touches across distribution center, that's really what's driving this deleverage recapture.  In 2024, we are assuming continued modest improvement on supply chain costs as a percentage of sales, driven by those initiatives I just mentioned, but also other specific productivity initiatives we're working on.  We are planning supply chain leverage as a contributor to the 50 basis points of operating margin expansion at the high end of our margin guidance for 2024. So those are the shorter term objectives.  Longer term, while we haven't specifically built this into the five year model we've laid out, we are building out much larger, more automated, more productive new distribution centers to accommodate our growth. Over time, we'll move an increasing percentage of our merchandise through these more efficient DCs that are designed for off price. And in the long term, this could drive even more leverage on supply chain expense. \nJohn Kernan: Maybe a follow-up for David. You increased the share buyback this quarter, $100 million, but the business generated nearly $400 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2023. How should we model the buyback on a quarterly basis and annual basis going forward? \nMichael O'Sullivan: We did, in fact, increase our buybacks to a little over $100 million last quarter, which was nearly double the previous quarter. So we were more opportunistic this past quarter, as we will from time to time, depending on valuation and liquidity. And we don't guide to buybacks, but I think you can see, looking at our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we had over $900 million in cash and over $1.6 billion in liquidity, so we're in a really very strong liquidity position.  As we've said many times before, our first priority is to invest in our growth. And Kristin just, a few questions ago, walked through our larger CapEx investment in 2024. Nevertheless, despite that step up, we still expect to generate sufficient cash flow, free cash flow to return excess cash to shareholders.  We're going to continue to be active, but we're not going to guide to a level. I guess what I would say is, if you look at the buyback level in fiscal 2023 for the year as a whole, that's probably a reasonable proxy for what you might expect, again, depending on market conditions.  I would also remind you that we had $500 million remaining at the end of Q4 on our buyback authorizations that run through August 2025. So we'll update you in May on our Q1 buyback opportunities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.\nBrooke Roach: Michael, as you evaluate the better-than-expected comp result in 4Q, can you share a bit more color on the impact that you may have seen in the fourth quarter from weather or other factors? \nMichael O'Sullivan: I'm going to answer your question, but I want to preface my answer by saying, we're students of our business, so we always analyze weather. We always analyze everything, but we always analyze weather to help us explain the context for our trends. But internally, and I want to underscore this internally, we're very careful to focus on what we control. We don't want our merchants or operators to use weather as an excuse.  But with that said, there were two main weather call-outs in Q4. I think the one that's most widely reported elsewhere is January. The weather in January was certainly disruptive with winter storms in many of our major markets. As we came into the month, we were running a stronger trend, but the disruptive weather dragged down our comp for the quarter.  But, look, it's, our view is it's January. Winter storms happen, and I assume that those storms also hurt other retailers in our markets.  There was another sort of weather impact in Q4 that probably hurt us disproportionately versus other retailers. That was driven by milder temperatures for most of November and for December versus last year. Those are obviously the prime selling months for outerwear, which for a company that many people still think of as Burlington Coat Factory is relatively very important. Our outerwear business is not just to drive our sales in its own right. It also brings traffic to the store and therefore lifts sales across other departments.  Now in Q4, our comp sales in outerwear was down in the negative mid-single digits. Leaving aside the broader impact on store traffic, that comp sales impact alone cost us a full point in overall comp sales for the quarter. \nBrooke Roach: As you look ahead, how are trends progressing quarter-to-date? Are there any specific items we should keep in mind as we think about the cadence of comp growth opportunity throughout the year? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Quarter-to-date, we've just wrapped up February. So, we're four weeks into the quarter. And truthfully, I would describe the trend in February as softer than we had anticipated.  Now I suspect you've probably heard that from some other retailers as well. We attribute that softness to maybe some unfavorable weather early in the month and then a slower pace of tax refunds versus last year. As we've discussed previously, our core customer is just extremely sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, especially the timing of earned income tax credit.  Now we're expecting that tax refunds will catch up over the next few weeks. But candidly, this is a good example of why it makes sense to plan our comp conservatively and flexibly, which is what we've done. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley.\nAlex Straton: I have two for Kristin. The first being, can you just break down the drivers of comp growth in the fourth quarter? How did that look across traffic, conversion, basket size, and AUR? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nKristin Wolfe: The single biggest driver of our comp growth in the fourth quarter was higher traffic. We see this as further evidence of the improving health of the off-price shopper. And in addition, conversion was slightly higher compared to last year.  Higher units per transaction were actually more than offset by lower AURs. The lower AURs were driven by a mix of business and expanded opening price points versus a year ago. \nAlex Straton: Any color on how the different regions performed in the quarter as well? \nKristin Wolfe: All regions were positive and comp performance was relatively broad based geographically. In the fourth quarter, the Southwest and the Midwest regions, those were the strongest performing regions in fourth-quarter 2023. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih: Congratulations on a nice end to the year. Michael, I was wondering, can you provide some additional color on the point that you had made about red price selling versus clearance, kind of two things to dig into there.  What do you think is the biggest driver of that? Is it the seasoning of the merch team? Is it the consumer at the margin slightly less price sensitive or is it the sharper price points that Kristin just mentioned? \nMichael O'Sullivan: One of the metrics that we always look at internally is our comp sales growth on regular price versus markdown merchandise. That's particularly important for us.  As you know, one of the major elements of Burlington 2.0 is to turn our in-store inventory out faster. That means fewer markdowns, and that means less clearance inventory. That's very healthy from a margin perspective, but lower clearance balances are also a slight headwind to comp.  I call that out in the comments because it was quite significant in Q4. Our clearance sales were down by about a fifth versus last year. Our regular price comp was up about 4%. We regard that as a very healthy sign. In other words, the customer likes what we're putting in front of them.  I would attribute it to all three of the things that you called out. I think our execution on the merchant side in the fall season was very good. And actually, one of things I really liked about how we managed the business in the fall season, there were some merchandise areas that did not perform well. But early in this season, we saw that they were not performing well, and our merchants and planners moved very quickly to take money out of those businesses and push that money into faster trending areas.  That's exactly what you want in an off -price business, and that worked well for us. It obviously saved margin dollars because had we not done that, we would have taken markdowns in those businesses. But it also helps drive the sales trend in businesses that we could chase.  So I feel good about what it says about the seasoning of the buyers, and also I also feel about good what is says our values. Ultimately, what's driving the customer to make a purchase is the value they are seeing in front of them. And if they're seeing great value at a regular price, then we don't need to mark it down. So, I take that as a very positive sign.  The last thing, I should say, I should add that we are planning faster inventory turns in 2024. So we anticipate that that comp headwind from lower clearance will continue to have an impact, especially in the first half of the year. We've factored that into our guidance, but I think it's worth calling out. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Maybe first for Michael, what impact would you expect department store closures to have on your business? \nMichael O'Sullivan: I would say that, in general, whenever a bricks and mortar competitor shuts down stores, that tends to help us. We would expect to pick up some of their traffic. But of course, the size of the impact depends upon which particular retailer, which specific geographies and which specific stores.  If a retailer closes stores that it has in more urban, lower to moderate income areas where we have a strong presence, then we would expect the impact to be bigger.  Stepping back, in terms of the overall outlook for bricks and mortar retail, we think it's likely that there are going to be a lot of store closures over the next two years. So like I say, in general, it's hard to be specific without looking at specific details. But in general, we would expect those closures to be a tailwind for us. \nMark Altschwager: And a follow-up for Kristin. Can you remind us how many of the Bed Bath leases you acquired last year? How many opened in the fourth quarter? And how should we think about the cadence for the remaining openings this year?\nKristin Wolfe: In total, we acquired 64 leases from Bed Bath & Beyond in the fall of last year. Of those 64 Bed Bath locations, we opened 32 in fiscal 2023 with the majority opening during the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we feel very good about how these stores are performing so far, pretty much as we had expected.  So at the end of Q4, we had 32 remaining to open. We expect to open the majority of these locations in the first quarter with the balance to open in the second quarter of 2024, and that will be all 64.  In 2023, the cost associated with the Bed Bath dark rent, these are the costs that we incur before the store is opened, totaled $18 million last year. In Q1, we expect these costs to be approximately $8 million with about $1 million expected in Q2. And then at that point, those costs will be fully recognized. \nOperator: We have time for one more question and that question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the low income consumer, can you expand on the health of the low income consumer, what you saw last year and how you're thinking about it for 2024? \nMichael O'Sullivan: I think this is a very important question. You probably picked this up from the script, but I think how this customer performs this year is going to be very important to our business. This customer is critical for us.  As I said in the prepared comments, we think that their situation has improved versus last year. Back then, they were experiencing double-digit increases in the cost of everyday essentials \u2013 food, rent, transportation, et cetera. So we think that that pressure eased in the back half of last year and that that helped to underpin our trend. But I don't want to overstate that.  Discretionary spending levels for this segment of shoppers have been seriously impacted over the last two years. You can see that in the results of most retailers who serve that lower end customer.  I should also add that although the situation may have eased, those customers are still highly sensitive to things like timing of tax refunds, which obviously we just spoke about.  And although inflation has come down, I think it's going to take a bit of time, considerable time for that customer to really start to recover. So that sort of ties to something else that we talked about in the script and that we've responded to on some of the questions.  So we really think the incremental growth for our business this year is going to have to come from increased penetration with trade down customers. We think that's where the opportunity is. We think that's really what drove our comp in the second half of last year. And we think there's more opportunity for us there. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone. I will now turn the call back to Michael O'Sullivan, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in May to discuss our first quarter 2024 fiscal results.  Thank you for your time today. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. And good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional details on the fourth quarter. Please note that the following discussion of fourth quarter financial results will be on a 13-week non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise indicated.  Total sales growth in the quarter was 9%. This was higher than our guidance of 5% to 7%, driven by higher comp store sales. Our comp sales growth in Q4 was 2%, which was above our guidance of minus 2% to flat. In addition, the 53rd week added $138 million in total sales to this result, bringing our Q4 total sales increase on a 14-week basis to approximately 14%.  The gross margin rate for the fourth quarter was 42 .6%, an increase of 190 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 140 basis point increase in merchandise margins, mostly driven by lower markdowns, as well as a 50 basis point decrease in freight expense.  Product sourcing costs were 20 basis points lower than last year. This was driven by supply chain leverage of 40 basis points, as we've made progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. This supply chain leverage was partially offset by higher incentive compensation.  Adjusted SG&A costs in Q4 were 100 basis points higher than last year, which included 20 basis points of deleverage attributable to expenses related to the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding Bed Bath & Beyond leases, adjusted SG&A deleverage was 80 basis points, driven primarily by higher incentive comp accruals and investments in store payroll.  Q4 adjusted EBIT margin was 11.1%, 110 basis points higher than last year, compared with guidance of 0 to 40 basis points. Again, this excludes Bed Bath & Beyond costs worth 20 basis points.  Our adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.69. This was well above the high end of our range of $3.10 to $3.25. This result and the guidance range exclude approximately $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that were acquired last fall. On a 14-week basis, our adjusted EPS was $3.72, again excluding $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores.  At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 5% below 2022, while our reserve inventory was 39% of our total inventory versus 48% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve.  We ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position, with approximately $1.6 billion in total liquidity, which consisted of $925 million in cash and $709 million in availability in our ABL. We had no borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter on our ABL.  During the quarter, we repurchased $103 million in common stock, bringing our annual share repurchases to $232 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $500 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in 2025.  In Q4, we opened 30 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 1,007 stores. This included 39 new store openings, 4 relocations, and 5 closings. For the full year, we opened 104 new stores, while relocating 13 stores and closing 11 stores, adding 80 net new stores to our fleet.  I will now move on to discuss our full-year 2023 results. Please note that the following discussion of fiscal 2023 financial results will be on a 52-week non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, the full year results I will share exclude the impact of approximately $18 million in expenses related to the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. In fiscal 2023, total sales increased 10% and comp store sales increased 4%. Our operating margin for the full year expanded by 130 basis points. Merchandise margin increased by 110 basis points, while freight improved by 90 basis points, which more than offset 40 basis points of deleverage in SG&A and 20 basis points of deleverage in product sourcing costs.  Let's now move to 2024 guidance. I will compare 2024 guidance to 2023 results on a 52-week basis. Also, this 2024 guidance excludes an anticipated $9 million in expenses associated with the acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. $8 million of these expenses are expected in the first quarter and $1 million in the second quarter.  For the 2024 fiscal year, we expect total sales growth in the range of 9% to 11%. We expect comp store sales to increase in the range of 0% to 2% for fiscal 2024, and our adjusted EBIT margin to increase 10 to 50 basis points versus last year. We expect higher merchandise margins, as well as freight and supply chain leverage to be the primary margin drivers in fiscal 2024. Keep in mind that we will be reporting comparable store sales in fiscal 2024 on a shifted basis, lining up the comparable weeks in fiscal 2023.  Capital expenditures, net of landlord allowances, are expected to be approximately $750 million in fiscal 2024. This results in adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $7 to $7.60, an expected increase of 12% to 22%.  For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total sales growth in the range of 9% to 11%. Comp store sales are assumed to increase between 0% and 2%.  We are expecting adjusted EBIT margin to increase in the range of 20 to 60 basis points over the first quarter of 2023, which result in an adjusted EPS outlook in the range of $0.95 to $1.10 in the first quarter. Again, we expect merchandise margin scrapes and supply chain leverage to be the primary drivers of this anticipated margin improvement.  I will now turn the call back to Michael. The margin drivers for 2024 are consistent with what we shared on the November call. That's higher merchandise margin and savings and freight and in supply chain. And these three margin drives are not dependent on sales, which is why we believe we can increase our EBIT margin on a flat to 2% comp by 10 to 50 basis points.  So let me go through each of these quickly. I'll start with merchandise margin. We continue to make good progress here, as evidenced by the 110 basis point increase in merchandise margin in fiscal 2023. We continue to believe we can turn faster and drive lower markdown. And as in 2024, we're entering with clearance levels down meaningfully versus last year, and our inventory levels and assortments are well-transitioned, are fresh, and with great values.  Secondly, on freight, freight continues to be a tailwind for us, particularly in the first half of 2024. We're benefiting from lower contracted domestic rates and remain largely covered with our contracts on ocean freight rates.  And finally, we're making good progress on supply chain expenses, as evidenced by the 40 basis points of leverage we drove in the fourth quarter. I would say these are the three line items that are the primary drivers of leverage in 2024.  There are two offsets that we're planning for in 2024 that I want to mention. One is SG&A. We do expect some modest deleverage in SG&A due to continued investment in store payroll, which we really didn't step up into the back half of 2023. In addition, we'd expect some deleverage on a 0% to 2% comp in SG&A, given that range.  And the second offset is in depreciation. We're planning for some modest deleverage in depreciation, given the step-up in CapEx we're planning for this year. We didn't provide line item guidance for the fourth quarter, so let me provide some color. The first thing I would say is there were not any, what I would consider, one-time benefits. In fact, we faced a margin headwind given the higher accrued incentive comp expense versus the fourth quarter of 2022.  So when I look at our Q4 margin, I feel good about the quality of the upside. Starting with gross margin, that increased 190 basis points. Freight came in largely as we had expected at 50 basis points lower, but the 140 basis point increase in merchandise margin was very healthy and better than we planned. As Michael highlighted in his prepared remarks, strong regular price selling did help drive lower markdowns than in turn a higher merchandise margin.  Within product sourcing costs, as I just mentioned, supply chain leveraged 40 basis points. That was ahead of our expectations, and that was due to higher productivity and benefits we're starting to realize from our efficiency initiatives and supply chain.  SG&A in the fourth quarter did delever by 80 basis points. Now, that excludes the Bed Bath & Beyond expenses. But that was in line with what we had expected and was driven primarily by higher incentive comp, as well as our store payroll investment during the quarter.  So, overall, for the fourth quarter, our 110 basis point increase in EBIT margin, that was 70 basis points above the high end of our guidance. We felt like this was a strong outcome, gives us confidence as we head into 2024, continue to expand operating margin.  And finally, the strength of Q4 did contribute to the 130 basis point increase in EBIT margin for the full year fiscal 2023. And that enabled us to ultimately exceed the high end of that original EBIT margin guidance for 120 basis point increase in fiscal 2023. Our CapEx plan for 2024 is $750 million, which is about 7% of sales. And most of that investment is in our stores and supply chain as we're stepping up investments to support accelerated new store growth, as well as the expansion of our distribution center network to support our larger store base.  Let me provide a little bit more color on these two main drivers. So starting with stores, as Michael mentioned, we're planning to open 100 net new stores, close or relocate about 40 stores. So that's approximately 140 gross new stores.  This is well above the level we've opened the last few years and actually the highest number of stores we've opened in our history in a year. Our store CapEx represents about 45% of the CapEx spend in 2024.  Secondly, on supply chain, supply chain CapEx is about 30% of our CapEx spend. The big driver of our CapEx spend in supply chain is the material handling equipment that will go into our state-of-the-art 2 million square foot DC opening in the southeast in 2026. That's about twice the size of our next largest DC and will be designed and built for our off-price business, be highly automated and more productive than any DC in our current network. These incremental investments in new stores and supply chain capacity are really what's driving the step up in CapEx this year and in the next few years. I'll take you through these separately starting with freight. In fiscal 2023, freight leveraged 90 basis points. Those savings were driven by lower freight rates, but also specific transportation initiatives we have to optimize our outbound and inbound processes.  We still expect freight to be a contributor to our margin expansion in fiscal 2024 as we anniversary lower freight rates in the first part of the year and we continue to drive efficiencies across transportation.  There has been some limited pressure on ocean freight on certain routes, but we do not see significant risk to our ocean freight and that's embedded in our merchandise margin. Domestic freight represents a significant majority of our freight expense and we continue to see some opportunity to bring that expense lower as we plan.  On supply chain, in the fourth quarter, I think I mentioned, supply chain cost leveraged 40 basis points compared to last year. And the efficiency initiatives that drove that that we previously discussed to reduce labor hours and processing reserve to more efficiently manage the flow of goods and minimize number of touches across distribution center, that's really what's driving this deleverage recapture.  In 2024, we are assuming continued modest improvement on supply chain costs as a percentage of sales, driven by those initiatives I just mentioned, but also other specific productivity initiatives we're working on.  We are planning supply chain leverage as a contributor to the 50 basis points of operating margin expansion at the high end of our margin guidance for 2024. So those are the shorter term objectives.  Longer term, while we haven't specifically built this into the five year model we've laid out, we are building out much larger, more automated, more productive new distribution centers to accommodate our growth. Over time, we'll move an increasing percentage of our merchandise through these more efficient DCs that are designed for off price. And in the long term, this could drive even more leverage on supply chain expense. The single biggest driver of our comp growth in the fourth quarter was higher traffic. We see this as further evidence of the improving health of the off-price shopper. And in addition, conversion was slightly higher compared to last year.  Higher units per transaction were actually more than offset by lower AURs. The lower AURs were driven by a mix of business and expanded opening price points versus a year ago. All regions were positive and comp performance was relatively broad based geographically. In the fourth quarter, the Southwest and the Midwest regions, those were the strongest performing regions in fourth-quarter 2023. In total, we acquired 64 leases from Bed Bath & Beyond in the fall of last year. Of those 64 Bed Bath locations, we opened 32 in fiscal 2023 with the majority opening during the fourth quarter. It's still early, but we feel very good about how these stores are performing so far, pretty much as we had expected.  So at the end of Q4, we had 32 remaining to open. We expect to open the majority of these locations in the first quarter with the balance to open in the second quarter of 2024, and that will be all 64.  In 2023, the cost associated with the Bed Bath dark rent, these are the costs that we incur before the store is opened, totaled $18 million last year. In Q1, we expect these costs to be approximately $8 million with about $1 million expected in Q2. And then at that point, those costs will be fully recognized."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us.  I would like to cover four topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our fourth quarter results. Secondly, I will comment on our full-year 2023 results. Thirdly, I will talk about our guidance for the year ahead. And finally, I will offer some longer term commentary. Then, Kristin will provide some additional financial details.  Okay. Let's talk about our Q4 results. Comp store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2% on a 13-week basis. This was above our guidance of minus 2% to flat.  I would like to peel back the onion a little and describe some important aspects of this fourth quarter comp performance. Firstly, we continue to see strong selling at our opening price points. The lower income customer, the need a deal shopper, is responding well to these values. This is a very important customer for us. A year ago, this shopper was really struggling with a higher cost of living and with the loss of pandemic era benefits. This customer is still fragile. The cost of living is not declining. It is just going up less quickly. That said, this represents an improvement versus last year and it may have helped to underpin our comp in Q4.  Secondly, what really drove our incremental comp growth in Q4 was the success of our strategies and businesses targeting trade downs or slightly higher income shoppers. These customers responded well with a higher mix of recognizable brands in our apparel and accessories businesses. These shoppers also grow very strong selling across our key holiday categories in gifting, accessories and home decor.  Frankly though, looking at the results of our peers, I am disappointed that we didn't drive stronger comp growth with these shoppers. There is clearly a bigger opportunity. The implication is that we have to offer stronger and even more compelling values on the brands and styles that these trade down shoppers are looking for.  The final point I would like to make about our Q4 results is that we saw strong selling on regular priced merchandise. In Q4, the merchandise in our stores turned faster and we ended up with less clearance inventory.  Our comp selling on clearance merchandise was down double digits. If I strip this out from our overall Q4 comp growth, in other words, if we just look at comp sales growth on regular priced merchandise, it was up 4%. This is very healthy. Later on, Kristin will talk about the impact that this strong regular price selling had on our merchandise margin.  Wrapping up my comments on our Q4 comp performance, we are happy that we beat guidance, but more importantly we see some clear opportunities to drive even stronger performance.  I would like to move off Q4 now. In fact, I would like to step back and provide a report card, if you will, for our full year 2023 performance. In 2023, our total sales grew by 10%. We believe that total sales is the best proxy indicator on what is happening with market share. This total sales growth was driven by 4% comp growth plus 80 net new store openings.  As I look back on these numbers, candidly, we would have liked to have done more. Let's start with new stores. In 2023, we opened 80 net new stores, but our goal over the last couple of years has been to ramp up to 100 net new stores a year. We have rigorous standards for the quality of new store locations, and over the last couple of years, this has made it difficult to hit this 100 store run rate.  That said, 2023 was a breakthrough year for our new store program. In the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy process, we acquired a large number of very attractive new store locations, and we identified and are negotiating on many others with the landlords. These deals have significantly strengthened our new store pipeline, and as we will discuss later, we are confident that we will hit our goal of 100 net new stores in 2024.  Okay, let me turn now to comp sales growth. For the full year 2023, we achieved comp growth of 4%. This was right in the middle of our original guidance range of 3% to 5%. But frankly, coming into 2023, we had hoped for better. There were external and internal factors that slowed us down in the first half of the year.  Externally, our core low income shopper continued to struggle with lower government benefits and with the rising cost of living. We did see some growth in trade down traffic from want-a-deal higher-income customers, but in Q1 and Q2, this was not enough to offset weakness with our core low income shoppers.  Internally, we had planned for a stronger trend at the start of the year. This hurt us because when the trend turned out to be weaker, we struggled to reposition ourselves. In retrospect, it would have been better to have had a lower sales plan and more liquidity. The Q1 trend would still have been solved, but we could have better positioned ourselves for Q2. In any event, by the second half, we were able to get ourselves in shape and to build momentum, beating our sales plan for the full season. Okay, the final section of the 2023 report card is earnings. We were able to drive 130 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023. This was ahead of our original guidance of 80 to 120 basis points. This helped to drive EPS growth of 46%, well ahead of guidance.  In a few moments, Kristin will dissect these results, but the headline is, this was a high quality earnings beat, driven by stronger merchandise margins and faster-than-expected progress on our major expense initiatives in freight and supply chains.  So, wrapping up on the 2023 report card, yes, we would have liked to have done more, but overall, we are happy with our double-digit total sales growth, 80 net new stores, 4% comp sales growth, and 130 basis points of operating margin expansion. These results give us confidence in the long-range financial targets that we shared on our November call.  Now, let's move on to 2024 and talk about our guidance. Of course, we previewed this guidance in November. Back then, we described our forecast as being based on 2% comp growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. Since then, we have built flexibility into the lower end of the range to give ourselves more room to chase. But to be clear, nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our thinking on the 2024 outlook.  I would like to discuss each driver of this guidance, new stores, comp stores, and operating margin expansion. In 2024, we expect to open approximately 140 gross new stores. Stripping out relocation and closures, this should result in 100 net new stores. We anticipate approximately one-third of these will open in the spring and two-thirds in the fall.  As discussed previously, new stores average about $7 million in volume in their first full year. These new store openings, together with our comp sales growth, should drive a total sales increase in the range of 9% to 11% this year.  Moving on to comp sales. For the full year and for Q1, we are guiding to 0% to 2% comp growth. As discussed in November, there is plenty of uncertainty in the outlook for 2024, so it makes sense to be cautious. As an off-price retailer, this allows us to manage our business and position ourselves to chase a stronger trend.  As I described a moment ago, one of the lessons from the spring of 2023 is that we came into the year with too strong of a plan. When the trend turned out to be weaker, in some of our businesses, we were not liquid enough to react. It would have been better if we had had a lower plan and then chased.  Moving on to margin. With our comp range of flat to 2%, we expect to be able to drive operating margin expansion of 10 basis points to 50 basis points. There are three drivers of this margin expansion. Higher merchant margin, lower freight expenses, and lower supply chain expenses. Kristin will talk more about these, but we feel good about the underlying plans we have in each of these areas.  Kristin will also explain that we expect this margin expansion to be slightly higher in Q1, 20 basis points to 60 basis points on a flat to 2% comp.  Let me wrap up now with a few comments on our longer term outlook. In our November call, we discussed our expectations for the growth of our business over the next five years. We believe we can grow total sales to approximately $16 billion and operating income to about $1.6 billion over this period.  We see three drivers of this growth. I will comment on each of these. New store openings and relocations \u2013 we expect to open about 100 net new stores a year, plus two to three dozen relocations of older, oversized, less productive stores.  As I described a moment ago, we are well positioned for 2024. Looking further out, we anticipate some lumpiness in the number of openings year to year. But, overall, we feel good about our longer term pipeline and the likely availability of attractive new store locations over the next few years.  Secondly, comp sales growth. There are good reasons to be cautious in how we plan and manage our business in the short term, especially the year ahead. But over the next five years, we believe we can achieve average comp growth in the mid-single-digits.  We think the external environment over the next few years is likely to be favorable for off price, and we are excited about the initiatives we have been pursuing to improve our own execution of the model.  Thirdly, margins. We believe we can grow our operating margins to 10% in the next five years from a combination of leverage on higher sales and cost savings opportunities that are unrelated to sales. We made good progress in 2023, and we are confident in our plans for 2024.  At this point, I would like to ask Kristin to share additional financial details on Q4 and on our first quarter 2024 and full year guidance. Thank you, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed. We are happy that we beat our comp guidance for the fourth quarter. But the more important takeaway from the quarter is that we have the opportunity to drive even stronger performance, especially by delivering stronger and more compelling value to trade down shoppers.  Stepping back and looking at 2023 as a whole, we would have liked to have done more. But, overall, we are happy with our double-digit total sales growth, 80 net new stores, 4% comp growth, and 130 basis points of margin expansion.  As we look ahead to 2024, there is plenty of uncertainty, and we see good reasons to be cautious. We are guiding 9% to 11% total sales growth, driven by 100 net new stores and 0% to 2% comp growth. With this sales growth, we anticipate margin expansion of 10 basis points to 50 basis points.  Lastly, we are very excited about the long-term prospects for our business. As we discussed in November, we think that, over the next five years, we can grow sales to $16 billion and drive our operating earnings to approximately $1.6 billion.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to your questions. It's a good question. Let me start by putting 2024 into context with the last three years. If I go back to 2021, our trend was extraordinarily strong, stronger than peers, fueled by the impact of pandemic era benefits on our poor, lower income shoppers. Then in 2022, we came back down to earth with a bump as those shoppers were crushed by lower benefits and by big increases in their cost of living. Now those issues continue to bleed into the first half of 2023.  So here we are, what to expect in 2024? I'm going to whisper this, but we think it's possible that 2024 could be the first full normal year since I joined Burlington in 2019. And that's kind of how we approached guidance for 2020.  In normal times, before the pandemic, we would likely have planned a low single-digit comp and then been ready to chase. Of course, we don't know if the trend in 2024 will be stronger or weaker. There is plenty of economic uncertainty, interest rates, inflation, gas prices, as well as political and geopolitical risks even.  But by planning 0% to 2% comp, we're positioning ourselves to react, I think, to an appropriate range of outcomes. If the trend is weaker than 2%, we can pull back and absorb it. If it's stronger than 2%, then we know we could chase it. I should add, in Q4, as we've just reported, we grew 2% comp versus last year, so that gives us some confidence that our 2024 guidance is reasonable.  The key part of your question was about our longer-term outlook, so let me try and reconcile our 2024 guidance to a longer range target of mid-single-digit comp growth. In the years leading up to the pandemic, although we might have planned low-single-digit comp, the intent was always to chase above that. And measured over multiple years, our comp indeed averaged 3% to 4%.  But we think that, as the after effects of the pandemic continue to recede, that's the right baseline for our longer term model. We believe all the underlying consumer, competitive and structural factors that drove that growth still exist.  But, in addition, we know that we've taken significant actions to improve our own execution of the off-price model. And as those actions gain traction, we expect to outperform that 3% to 4% baseline. So, if I pull all this together, for the 12 months ahead, for 2024, our plan is based on low-single-digit comp growth with the potential to chase.  In future years, I should add, it will likely take a similar approach, and I expect in some years, we'll chase and beat that number. In other years, we won't. But we believe over an extended period, a five-year period, we will be able to achieve average annual comp growth in the mid-single-digits. Let me anchor my answer on the gross number of new store openings. We expect to open about 140 new stores on a gross basis this year. That includes relocating a couple of dozen of our older, oversized, less productive stores.  As we've described previously, that program of relocations is pretty important. It's going to be important to us in the next few years as we reposition ourselves away from some of our less attractive legacy real estate.  Anyway, if you take 140 gross new stores and remove those relocations and remove any closures, then we expect our incremental number of new stores to net down to about 100. As I said in the prepared remarks, we have high standards and tight controls for the quality of the real estate where we open new stores. Each potential location is analyzed carefully based on the traffic, trade area, demographics, and co-tenants. And based upon those detailed characteristics, we feel pretty excited about the new stores that we're planning to open this year.  Now beyond this year, it's a little difficult to get specific, but I'd offer up a couple of comments. We typically manage our new store pipeline two to three years out. So we still have plenty of work to do on our 2025 new store pipeline, but so far I would say it's shaping up well.  It includes a number of additional former Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we didn't pursue directly during the bankruptcy process, but instead have negotiated directly with the underlying landlords. And we're excited about those locations.  Beyond 2025, the pipeline is going to depend on the availability of attractive real estate locations. Again, difficult to be specific, but given the weak outlook across bricks and mortar retail, there are reasons to think that that availability could be fairly strong. I would say that historically in off price, and certainly for us, the lower income shopper has been, A, or even B, major driver of growth. But since early 2022, that has not been the case. In fact, I would say that, for the last few years, it's been clear that right now the growth in off price is being driven by higher income shoppers. That's not a new revelation. We talked about that last year.  In 2023, especially in the fall, we pursued a number of strategies to go after those shoppers, in particular focused on delivering a higher mix of recognizable brands and on elevating our assortments in specific businesses. Those strategies worked. They worked really well. But looking back, we could see that we could/should maybe have been even more aggressive.  Many of the areas that I'm talking about require that you make buying commitments well ahead of time. In other words, it's more difficult to chase in some of those businesses. And that means that you have to commit further out. And that means you have to be prepared to take more risk. So although I'm happy with the success of the strategies we pursued, in retrospect, I think we should have leaned in more. We should have taken a little more risk. And we might have ended up actually with a slightly lower margin, but we could have driven more sales.  So as we look at 2024, we see that as an opportunity. Again, the lead times are a little longer for many of those brands and those businesses. So I would say the opportunity is likely to be stronger in the second half versus the first.  I guess the last thing I would say is that we have always had a lower mix of higher income shoppers than some of our peers. We know this. It's partly a reflection of where our stores are located.  I think we've shared before that about 70% of our stores are in trade areas where the mean household income is less than $80 ,000. That footprint is not going to change in the short term. But what 2023 demonstrated is that we have enough higher income shoppers coming into our stores, but we can drive incremental sales if we offer great value on the recognizable brands, styles, and items that they are looking for. So we're going to go after that business much more aggressively in 2024. We did, in fact, increase our buybacks to a little over $100 million last quarter, which was nearly double the previous quarter. So we were more opportunistic this past quarter, as we will from time to time, depending on valuation and liquidity. And we don't guide to buybacks, but I think you can see, looking at our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we had over $900 million in cash and over $1.6 billion in liquidity, so we're in a really very strong liquidity position.  As we've said many times before, our first priority is to invest in our growth. And Kristin just, a few questions ago, walked through our larger CapEx investment in 2024. Nevertheless, despite that step up, we still expect to generate sufficient cash flow, free cash flow to return excess cash to shareholders.  We're going to continue to be active, but we're not going to guide to a level. I guess what I would say is, if you look at the buyback level in fiscal 2023 for the year as a whole, that's probably a reasonable proxy for what you might expect, again, depending on market conditions.  I would also remind you that we had $500 million remaining at the end of Q4 on our buyback authorizations that run through August 2025. So we'll update you in May on our Q1 buyback opportunities. I'm going to answer your question, but I want to preface my answer by saying, we're students of our business, so we always analyze weather. We always analyze everything, but we always analyze weather to help us explain the context for our trends. But internally, and I want to underscore this internally, we're very careful to focus on what we control. We don't want our merchants or operators to use weather as an excuse.  But with that said, there were two main weather call-outs in Q4. I think the one that's most widely reported elsewhere is January. The weather in January was certainly disruptive with winter storms in many of our major markets. As we came into the month, we were running a stronger trend, but the disruptive weather dragged down our comp for the quarter.  But, look, it's, our view is it's January. Winter storms happen, and I assume that those storms also hurt other retailers in our markets.  There was another sort of weather impact in Q4 that probably hurt us disproportionately versus other retailers. That was driven by milder temperatures for most of November and for December versus last year. Those are obviously the prime selling months for outerwear, which for a company that many people still think of as Burlington Coat Factory is relatively very important. Our outerwear business is not just to drive our sales in its own right. It also brings traffic to the store and therefore lifts sales across other departments.  Now in Q4, our comp sales in outerwear was down in the negative mid-single digits. Leaving aside the broader impact on store traffic, that comp sales impact alone cost us a full point in overall comp sales for the quarter. Quarter-to-date, we've just wrapped up February. So, we're four weeks into the quarter. And truthfully, I would describe the trend in February as softer than we had anticipated.  Now I suspect you've probably heard that from some other retailers as well. We attribute that softness to maybe some unfavorable weather early in the month and then a slower pace of tax refunds versus last year. As we've discussed previously, our core customer is just extremely sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, especially the timing of earned income tax credit.  Now we're expecting that tax refunds will catch up over the next few weeks. But candidly, this is a good example of why it makes sense to plan our comp conservatively and flexibly, which is what we've done. One of the metrics that we always look at internally is our comp sales growth on regular price versus markdown merchandise. That's particularly important for us.  As you know, one of the major elements of Burlington 2.0 is to turn our in-store inventory out faster. That means fewer markdowns, and that means less clearance inventory. That's very healthy from a margin perspective, but lower clearance balances are also a slight headwind to comp.  I call that out in the comments because it was quite significant in Q4. Our clearance sales were down by about a fifth versus last year. Our regular price comp was up about 4%. We regard that as a very healthy sign. In other words, the customer likes what we're putting in front of them.  I would attribute it to all three of the things that you called out. I think our execution on the merchant side in the fall season was very good. And actually, one of things I really liked about how we managed the business in the fall season, there were some merchandise areas that did not perform well. But early in this season, we saw that they were not performing well, and our merchants and planners moved very quickly to take money out of those businesses and push that money into faster trending areas.  That's exactly what you want in an off -price business, and that worked well for us. It obviously saved margin dollars because had we not done that, we would have taken markdowns in those businesses. But it also helps drive the sales trend in businesses that we could chase.  So I feel good about what it says about the seasoning of the buyers, and also I also feel about good what is says our values. Ultimately, what's driving the customer to make a purchase is the value they are seeing in front of them. And if they're seeing great value at a regular price, then we don't need to mark it down. So, I take that as a very positive sign.  The last thing, I should say, I should add that we are planning faster inventory turns in 2024. So we anticipate that that comp headwind from lower clearance will continue to have an impact, especially in the first half of the year. We've factored that into our guidance, but I think it's worth calling out. I would say that, in general, whenever a bricks and mortar competitor shuts down stores, that tends to help us. We would expect to pick up some of their traffic. But of course, the size of the impact depends upon which particular retailer, which specific geographies and which specific stores.  If a retailer closes stores that it has in more urban, lower to moderate income areas where we have a strong presence, then we would expect the impact to be bigger.  Stepping back, in terms of the overall outlook for bricks and mortar retail, we think it's likely that there are going to be a lot of store closures over the next two years. So like I say, in general, it's hard to be specific without looking at specific details. But in general, we would expect those closures to be a tailwind for us. I think this is a very important question. You probably picked this up from the script, but I think how this customer performs this year is going to be very important to our business. This customer is critical for us.  As I said in the prepared comments, we think that their situation has improved versus last year. Back then, they were experiencing double-digit increases in the cost of everyday essentials \u2013 food, rent, transportation, et cetera. So we think that that pressure eased in the back half of last year and that that helped to underpin our trend. But I don't want to overstate that.  Discretionary spending levels for this segment of shoppers have been seriously impacted over the last two years. You can see that in the results of most retailers who serve that lower end customer.  I should also add that although the situation may have eased, those customers are still highly sensitive to things like timing of tax refunds, which obviously we just spoke about.  And although inflation has come down, I think it's going to take a bit of time, considerable time for that customer to really start to recover. So that sort of ties to something else that we talked about in the script and that we've responded to on some of the questions.  So we really think the incremental growth for our business this year is going to have to come from increased penetration with trade down customers. We think that's where the opportunity is. We think that's really what drove our comp in the second half of last year. And we think there's more opportunity for us there. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in May to discuss our first quarter 2024 fiscal results.  Thank you for your time today."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Burlington Stores, Inc. Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to David Glick, Group Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will share a few comments on our third quarter results and our forecast for the rest of the year. But then we are going to devote most of our remarks talking about our longer-range financial expectations. We will also provide some early thinking on the outlook for 2024.  Okay. Let's start with our Q3 results. Comp store sales for the third quarter increased 6%. This was the midpoint of our guidance range of 5% and to 7%. During the quarter, we were very pleased with our back-to-school trends. Our quarter-to-date comp growth through September were slightly ahead of our guidance range, but then unseasonably warm weather in October slowed this trend. Of course, we have a very strong heritage in outerwear.  So warmer temperatures in October tend to have a more negative impact on us compared to other retailers. Overall, given this unfavorability in weather as well as the general softness across discretionary retail, we were pleased with our third quarter performance. For the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our previously issued comp store and adjusted EPS guidance. We are up against our toughest multiyear compares and the external economic environment is uncertain. Our guidance is for comp growth in the range of negative 2% to flat. We are pleased that November is off to a solid start, but the highest volume weeks are still ahead of us. I'm going to move on now and talk about our longer-range financial model.  Some time ago, we had said that we would update our longer-range model this year. I am going to share the main headlines from this model, and then I will discuss the key assumptions behind these headlines. While any long-range model is, of course, subject to various uncertainties we think it is important and helpful for investors as well as vendors, landlords and other constituents to understand where we are headed.  Okay, the main headlines. Over the next 5 years, we expect to grow our total sales to approximately $16 billion. This represents about 60% of aggregate growth versus 2023. We project that our average growth rate each year for total sales will be in the low double digits. We expect our operating income over this period to grow to approximately $1.6 billion. In dollar terms, this is almost 3x our forecasted 2023 operating income. As a percentage of sales, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 10% by 2028. The assumptions that underpin this financial model can be grouped into 3 main buckets: new store sales, comp store sales and operating margin.  Starting with new store sales. Over the next 5 years, we now expect to open approximately 500 net new stores on our current pace of over 1,000. These will be comprised mostly by our 25,000 square foot prototype located in busy script malls.  We feel very good about the economics of these stores. We also plan to relocate or downsize a substantial number of our older, less productive and oversized locations. We anticipate 2 to 3 dozen of these store relocations and downsizes each year. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute these new store openings and relocations. As you would expect, our plans for 2024 are well advanced. And our new store pipeline beyond 2024 looks healthy. There may be some lumpiness year-to-year, but still, we expect to achieve the aggregate number of net new openings that I have just outlined.  We anticipate that this new store opening program will be the most significant driver of our annual double-digit total sales growth. I'm going to move on to comp sales growth. Looking at the next 5 years as a whole, we expect that our average annual comp sales growth will be in the mid-single digits. The starting point for this average annual mid-single-digit comp assumption is that prior to 2020, our average comp growth was in the range of 3% to 4%. This comp trend was interrupted by the pandemic. And over the last 3 years, it has been positive 15% followed by minus 13%. And now for fiscal 2023, we are forecasting positive 3%. We anticipate some continued variability year-to-year. In some years, our comp growth may be below mid-single digits and in some years, it may be above.  That said, we believe that the extreme pandemic era volatility is now behind us. In fact, this is evident in our 2023 year-to-date comp trend. As we look at the outlook for off-price and for our core customer over the next 5 years, we think that this 3% to 4% baseline is a good starting point for our model. But there are strong reasons why we believe we can outperform this baseline over the 5-year period. Firstly, since 2019, we have taken numerous steps to make our business more off-price these steps have included strengthening our merchandising capabilities and making our operational processes more flexible. These are not unproven strategies. They have driven the success of our off-price peers over many years. We recognize that over the last few years, we have introduced a lot of change all at once. And this has impacted our ability to achieve the level of execution that we would have liked.  Also, we have been rolling out these changes -- at the same time, as the external environment has been difficult. Since early 2022, our core customer has been under significant economic pressure. But let me get back to my main point. It is important to understand that leaving aside for short-term challenges, the strategies we have been pursuing to become more off-price are not unproven strategies. Over the next few years, we expect these strategies and our improved execution of these strategies have a growing and positive impact on our results.  In addition, our new store and relocation programs have the potential provide a helpful comp tailwind over time. This will not happen right away. In fact, as we ramp up our new store openings, in 2024, there will be some slight cannibalization of comp stores by the newer stores. But then as the new stores join the comp base, they typically out-comp the chain for several years. As more and more new stores join our comp base, we believe this tailwind to comp growth could increase. One other point to note is that when we relocate older stores, we typically see a nice sales lift.  This makes sense. We are moving to a better, more up-to-date store in a busier location. We expect that this could be an additional comp tailwind in in the next few years as we increase relocations. Okay. I am going to move on now and talk about our operating margin. Based on our latest 2023 forecast, we have lost about 300 basis points of operating margin since 2019. This has been driven by higher supply chain costs, mostly labor rates and higher freight costs. In the next 5 years, we expect to offset all of this, 300 basis points and more, taking operating margins to approximately 10% in 2028.  Let me describe the key components of this expansion. Firstly, there are a number of savings opportunities that are unrelated to sales growth. We estimate that these are worth about 200 basis points. And we expect to capture the majority of these savings over the next few years, starting with about 50 basis points in 2024. There are 3 main sources of these savings. Higher merchant margin, mostly lower markdowns, lower freight expenses, partially from lower freight rates, but also driven by specific transportation initiatives and lower supply chain expenses again, driven by specific efficiency and labor productivity initiatives. There may be additional upside in supply chain expenses through investments in distribution center automation. But our expectation is that these benefits may take longer than 3 years and we have, therefore, not included them in these savings estimates.  The second major source of margin expansion is sales leverage. There are 2 forms of this total sales leverage and comp sales leverage. By growing total sales at double-digit rates, we expect to capture leverage on G&A costs, including buying and planning expenses and costs related to corporate functions. In addition, if we grow comp sales at mid-single-digit rates, and we should be able to leverage store-related fixed costs such as occupancy -- over the next 5 years, we expect to capture about 200 basis points of margin from these sources of sales leverage. Let me segue now to our initial thinking on 2024. Although we believe that over the next 5 years, we can achieve average annual comp sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are planning 2024 more cautiously than this. There is a lot of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainties.  It is difficult to predict what this uncertainty might mean for our business. In addition, over the past couple of years, we have implemented a lot of changes in our business, and we think that it makes sense to be cautious about how quickly these changes may have an impact. So for 2024, our initial forecast is for 2% comp growth. With this 2% comp growth, we expect to capture about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion next year.  At this point, I would like to hand the call off to Kristin to discuss more financial details on Q3, our long-range model and 2024. \nKristin Wolfe : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional details on the third quarter. Total sales growth in the quarter was 12%. This was slightly lower than we had expected, driven by later opening dates for new stores during the quarter as well as a shift in a handful of new store openings into the fourth quarter. In Q3, we opened 38 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 977 stores. For the full year, we now expect to open approximately 80 net new stores. Our comp sales growth in Q3 was 6%, which was the midpoint of our range of 5% to 7%.  As Michael described, we were very pleased with our comps trend through September had then softened due to unseasonably warm temperatures in October. As a point of reference, at this time of year, cold weather merchandise categories, such as outerwear, represent about 25% of our business. Many shoppers still think of us as Burlington Coat Factory. So as you would expect, our comp trends strengthened when the weather finally turned cooler at the start of November. Our adjusted EPS in Q3 was $1.10, which was near the high end of our range of $0.97 to $1.12. This result and the guidance range excludes approximately $10 million of expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we acquired earlier this year.  As a reminder, these expenses are mostly dark rent for the period between the acquisition of the leases and this time that the stores will open. The gross margin rate for Q3 was 43.2%, an increase of 200 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 150 basis point increase in merchandise margin, mostly driven by lower markdowns and a 50 basis point decrease in freight expense. Product sourcing costs were 10 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher supply chain costs. These costs have been a headwind all year. But as we have discussed, we have identified and developed a number of specific initiatives to drive efficiency savings and labor productivity improvements in our distribution centers over the next few years.  Adjusted SG&A costs in Q3 were about 50 basis points higher than last year, which included 40 basis points of deleverage attributable to expenses related to the recently acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding those expenses, the slight SG&A deleverage was driven by a deliberate decision to increase staffing levels in our stores. We were not happy with the service levels in our stores last year and the increase in store payroll is intended to address this. Our Q4 guidance and our initial plans for 2024 include this additional store payroll. Q3 adjusted EBIT margin was 4.8%. 210 basis points higher than last year compared with guidance of 170 basis points to 220 basis points. Again, this excludes Bed Bath and Beyond costs worth 40 basis points.  Turning to Q4. As Michael mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance is based on comp sales of negative 2% to flat versus last year. We expect that this current range should lead to a Q4 adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.25. Including the 53rd week, which has adjusted EPS of approximately $0.05 Q4 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30.  Now I would like to share some additional details on our long-range financial model. These additional details may be useful to understand our underlying assumptions in developing this model.  Starting with new stores. We expect to average about 100 net new store openings a year over the next 5 years. As we have described previously, we expect new stores to open at about 70% of our average store volume. New stores joined the comp base about 15 months after opening. And then they typically out comp the chain for several years. As a reminder, our underwriting hurdles for new stores require that they be EBIT accretive in their first full year with the relevant performance title being based on our 2019 EBIT margin. Over the next 5 years, we also expect to relocate a substantial number of our older less productive oversized stores.  When we relocate a store, we typically see a comp sales lift for that store and improved profitability. The comp lift averages about 10%. The new store is usually close to the old location within a 0.5 mile, but it's typically in a better and busier sensor. Our goal when we relocate a store is to retain the existing customer and also importantly, to pick up new customers' traffic. As Michael described, we expect that our new store openings, together with mid-single-digit comp sales growth should drive low double-digit total sales growth over the next 5 years.  Now let me review our long-range assumptions for operating margin. We have identified savings opportunities unrelated to sales leverage, that are worth about 200 basis points. We believe that we can capture most of these savings in the next few years. In addition, over the next 5 years, we expect about 200 basis points of expansion, driven by the leverage on total sales and on comp sales growth. This means that if sales perform in line with our projections, then we anticipate that our operating margin over the next 5 years should increase to approximately 10%.  The pace at which this happens will depend on year-to-year sales growth. One other point to call out is that in order to support new store growth and the expansion of distribution center capacity, we are planning to increase our CapEx spending. We expect CapEx to run at about 7% of sales for the next few years before dropping back to around 5% of sales. We expect to generate a lot of cash in the next 5 years sufficient to fund the growth needs of the business while still returning excess cash to shareholders.  Let me wrap up with some additional details on how we are thinking about 2024. We are in the midst of our 2024 budgeting process. But right now, our working assumption is for top line growth of about 11%. This is driven by 2% comp store sales growth plus 100 net new store openings. We also expect about 30 store relocations in 2024. As described earlier, in 2024, with 2% comp sales growth, we expect to capture about 50 basis points of margin expansion. We have more work to do, but we feel good about our detailed plans for going after these savings. As a reminder, we typically generate 10 to 15 basis points of operating margin leverage for each point of comp ahead of the sales plan.  Of course, the comments that we have made today regarding our 2024 plans are preliminary and subject to change based on the developments over the next few months. We will provide final guidance in more detail during our Q4 call in early March.  I will now turn the call back to Michael \nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed this morning. First of all, briefly on Q3, given the softness across retail and the unfavorable weather in October, we are pleased with our Q3 comp and earnings performance. Meanwhile, November is off to a solid start, and this gives us confidence in our previously discussed Q4 guidance. Secondly and more importantly, we have spent most of these remarks talking about the longer-term outlook. The last few years have been extraordinarily volatile and unpredictable. But that volatility has started to wane. We are very bullish about the prospects for our business. We expect to grow our top line sales by about 60% in the next 5 years driven by our new store opening program and comp store sales growth.  We also see significant opportunity to recover and drive our operating margin. Compared to 2023, we expect our operating margin in dollar terms to almost triple in the next 5 years. Lastly, for 2024, we are developing our initial plans based on 2% comp store sales growth and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. If the underlying sales trend turns out to be stronger, then we will be ready to chase. And if we achieved sales above plan, then we would expect additional operating margin expansion.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And really appreciate all the additional color. So Michael, on your initial comp sales assumption for 2024, which calls for 2% growth, is that comp assumption being driven by specific concerns about the outlook next year? Or should we think of it just being driven by your standard off-price playbook of planning comp sales conservatively and being ready to chase? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Matt, thank you for the question. The direct one is that it's a bit of both. There are valid reasons to be cautious and it makes sense to manage our business this way. Clearly, there's a lot of concern and anxiety among analysts and investors about the external environment, the economy, retail sales and especially about the low-income consumer. And to that, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty about the political and geopolitical environment. We're not economic experts. So it's difficult for us to assess all those risks and to calibrate the potential impact on our business.  We also know that many of the improvements that we've made over the past few years, especially the new tools and processes that we've rolled out in merchandising will take time to gain momentum. They are going to have a significant impact, but that impact is likely to build over time. The last thing I'll say is that when we came into 2023, we had bigger expectations for the strength of our sales trend this year. Our business has gotten stronger this year. Our comp is running at positive 5% year-to-date. But we'd actually hoped for a little bit more. I think that those higher expectations hurt us in some parts of our business, we may have over planned sales.  And then when the trend turned out to be a little weaker, it made it harder for us to pull back. In retrospect, it might have turned out better for us if we plan our business a bit more cautiously this year. So putting all those things together, given all the uncertainty, given the changes we've made in our business, given some of the lessons from this year, we think a 2% comp growth assumption is an appropriate one at this point for our budget for 2024. We hope the trend is stronger. We're very confident that if it is, we'll be able to chase it. \nMatthew Boss : Great. And then to follow up, Kristin, could you share any more details of the 200 basis points of margin opportunity that you cited as unrelated to sales? And maybe just more specifically, any additional color that you can provide on the 50 basis points that you think you can capture in 2024 would be great. \nKristin Wolfe : Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. As you said, and we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to capture about 200 basis points of margin expansion in the next few years, unrelated to sales leverage. There are really 3 main sources of these savings. First is higher merchandise margin. This is mostly driven by lower markdowns and while we have made meaningful progress increasing merch margins, but we continue to believe we have opportunity to turn faster and reduce markdowns further.  The second area is in lower freight expenses these savings in freight are driven by lower freight rates as well as specific transportation initiatives that we have to optimize outbound and inbound processes and drive efficiencies throughout our transportation. We've made good progress on freight. By the end of this year, freight will be less than 100 basis points higher than 2019 levels, and we believe that we can recover more of this in the next few years. The third area is the third area of opportunity is from lower supply chain expenses, really driven by productivity and efficiency initiatives in our DCs.  As you know, and as we've talked about, we've significantly increased the level of closeout or true off-price buys. These all require more time to process in distribution centers. We've also substantially increased our use of reserve inventory. So we've had a significant number of learnings, and we're focused on numerous efficiency initiatives to: one, reduce labor hours and processing these buys two: more efficiently manage the flow of goods in and out of reserves. And lastly, to minimize the number of touches in our distribution center and finally, as it relates to the last part of your question as it relates to 2024, we expect 50 basis points of EBIT expansion on a 2 comp.  And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're still in the midst of the budgeting process. We have more work to do. But at this point, we have good line of sight and fairly detailed plans for going after this 50 basis points of margin expansion and it includes a combination of leverage from these 3 items we talked about, merch margin, freight expenses and supply chain. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIke Boruchow : A couple of questions. First, thank you, everyone, for the information and the long-range financial model, very helpful. I guess if I just take a step back, be interested if there's any commentary on where you think the biggest risks are in the model when you look at? And I guess maybe specifically, are there any major risks that could undermine the financial projections that you guys have, whether it's revenue or margin or just anything there would be helpful? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Okay. Yes, it's a good question. It's something I've thought a lot about. Let me -- I'm going to describe and editorialize three sets of risks in the model. I'll start with long term or structural risks. This is my third decade in off-price retail. And as long as I've been in the industry, there have always been some commentators who are worried that off-price is going to run out of market share or run out of supply or that it will be eclipsed by some new innovative business model or perhaps some new technology. Now of course, it's important that we always be alert to those kinds of structural risks but I have to say that I'm extremely skeptical. I see nothing out there that seriously threatens the long-term growth of off-price. So at this point, I'm really not that worried about long-term or structural or strategic risks.  The second bucket is short-term risk. These are things that can happen in any given year that can impact the trend such as a spike in inflation or a sharp economic slowdown or some other major disruptive event I'm much more wary of those short-term risks than I am of the longer-term structural. Any long-term structural threats. These short-term factors are, by definition, very hard to predict. The implication for us is that we need to be flexible. If we can plan cautiously and if we tightly control liquidity, inventory levels and expenses, then we'll be in much better shape to react to whatever happens, and that's really the poor principle behind Burlington 2.0. But as I say, I do worry about those short-term risks.  The third bucket of risks is internal. In other words, our own execution. As I said in the script, we've introduced a lot of change in a short period of time. And together with a tough external environment, especially for our core customer over the past 18 months, that's all impact -- it impacted our ability to achieve the level of execution we would have liked. But here's the thing. The changes that we've made are proven strategies. We recognize that it may take time to get the momentum, and it may take time to get the consistent execution that we'd like. But we know that these strategies were.  We know that upside is still ahead of us. So anyway, I guess just sort of summing up my answer, long term or structural risks, we need to watch them. But candidly, I wouldn't be too concerned. Much more concerned about the term risks. We need to plan sales cautiously, then be ready to react and to chase.  And then lastly, internal risks. We've made a lot of changes, but their impact, in my view, is only a question of timing. We're confident that the changes we've made, the strategies we're pursuing are going to drive stronger execution over the next few years. \nIke Boruchow : Got it. And then I have one follow-up for Kristin in regarding the new stores. progress have you made in opening the Bed Bath stores you guys acquired last quarter? And can you remind us how these stores impact net store openings this year in the 100 number for next year? \nKristin Wolfe : Ike, good morning. Thanks for the question. Quickly, as a point of clarification, we were able to acquire 2 additional leases from Bed Bath & Beyond. So the total is now 64 leases through the bankruptcy process. And as a quick reminder, we prioritized these leases based on nonfinancial and financial criteria. So the nonfinancial criteria included strategic factors like the location, the specific market as well as competitive and site particular site-specific aspects, the strip center, the co-tenancy, the demographics.  And then on the financial side, we ensure that these new stores met our financial hurdles, taking into account rent levels, including the dark rent will be incurred before we stored open the expected volumes, operating margins, the CapEx and obviously, the expected rate of return. So we're pleased that we will open approximately half of these 64 stores we acquired in fiscal '23 and we'll open the other half in early 2024. Now because we're incurring occupancy costs in these locations, we prioritize these stores. We're pushing to get them open as quickly as possible. And of course, prioritizing these stores meant some of our non-Bed Bath & Beyond store openings flipped into next year. Thus, our overall net new store count for the year is 80 net new stores at the high end of our original plan. Now this group of stores will also enable us to open that 100 net new stores in 2024. And then the last point I want to make is it's important to call out, there are many other former Bed Bath & Beyond stores that have reverted to the landlord. And it's likely we'll pursue many of these stores with the landlords over the next couple of years and these stores would form an important part of our normal new store pipeline. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America \nLorraine Hutchinson : I wanted to ask a question on the long-range model. You described 3 drivers of earnings growth, new stores, comp growth and margin expansion. If the comp sales growth is lower, like in the low single digits, would the model still generate significant earnings growth? \nKristin Wolfe : I'll take that question. As you said, our long-range model has 3 drivers of earnings growth. New stores, comp sales growth and margin expansion. Now of course, to maximize shareholder value and to achieve our full potential, we will aggressively go after all 3 of these drivers. We believe that we have significant opportunity in each of them. But I'll spend just a minute to your question on comp sales growth. We expect over the next several years, off-price retail will continue to take share from other retail formats. This will come as new store growth and as comp sales growth.  Now we've improved and we've invested in our business over the last few years to make the assortments in our stores as compelling as possible to make sure we are offering great value, and we are very confident that these improvements are going to drive significant comp sales growth over the next several years. That is what is in our long-range model. But yes, hypothetically, you are correct in your question, even with low single-digit comp growth, our business has significant earnings power, driven by new store growth an operating margin expansion that's unrelated to comp growth that we've talked about. But I just want to underscore one last point here. We believe and we expect that we're going to drive significant comp sales growth over the next several years.  So even though it may be true that we can drive earnings growth with a low single-digit comp, we would not be happy with that performance as that would not be full potential. \nLorraine Hutchinson : And then I wanted to ask a follow-up question to Michael. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of customer trends. Are you seeing any improvement or deterioration in the low-income consumer? And also any increase in terms of trade down consumers in your stores? \nMichael O'Sullivan: Lorraine. As you know, in 2022, this shopper really struggled with the combination of lower benefits and higher inflation. I would say as the cost of living went up last year, money that those shoppers might have spent at Burlington had to be used instead to pay for higher grocery bills or higher rent or higher gas prices. Now turning to this year, inflation is obviously lower this year. So I would say the situation has improved. The cost of living hasn't gone down, but at least it stopped going up or at least stop going up by as much.  And I think we may be seeing some early evidence that the low-income customer is actually starting to recover at least starting to recover from the shock of last year. One point I would make about this customer is that they go shopping when they have a true need. We think that's why our business did so well going back to school. Every year, kids get bigger and they go back to school, there's a true need. You have to buy them close and supplies. So this low income customer comes out to shop curing back to school and it felt like this year, they had a little more money to spend, certainly versus last year. And I think that's consistent with the point that they may be feeling a little less economic pressure than they were in 2022.  Add to that, I do think our teams do a very nice job delivering great value on opening price points going back to school, not just by opening price points, I mean, merchandise that isn't just cheap, but it has great fashion and quality all at a great value.  Let me move on and talk about the trade-down customer because I think -- and obviously, the trade down customer tends to be a little higher income, moderate to hire income and then more of a wanted deal rather than a net deal shopper. I would say that customer has definitely contributed to our 5% comp growth year-to-date.  We really leaned into that shopping. We've increased the proportion of better and more recognizable brands in the assortment. And we've adjusted our mix of good, better and best. And this has worked well for us this year. There are also -- there are specific categories that I would say we're doing particularly well at with the shopper. Our accessories business, parts of our home business, parts of our ladies apparel business. We've chased and fueled some really nice trends in those categories by delivering a higher mix of recognizable brands and elevated assortments.  Our expectation coming into this year was that the economy would slow down, and that would cause shoppers to become more value conscious, and therefore, we've seen more trade down traffic in our stores. And that has happened, perhaps not to the extent we would have liked, but it has happened. As we look forward to 2024, we think it's possible that we'll see more of that trade down -- if that happens, I think we're in very good shape to take advantage of it. The off-price supply environment continues to be very good, and we have strong and growing access to brands at great values. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan from Cowen. \nJohn Kernan : Excellent. Michael, Kristin and David, thanks for the detail. Michael, it sounds like you're happier with the level of execution you achieved this year versus last year? Are there additional opportunities particularly as you look at the margin improvement opportunities. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, thank you for your question. Let me start my answer by contrasting this year with last year. In 2022, the external environment was very difficult. Business would have been tough, no matter what. But we compounded that tough environment by making some mistakes of our own. And I would say we definitely learned from those mistakes. This year, in 2023, the external environment has gotten a lot better, and our own execution has significantly improved. That said, there's still plenty of room for improvement.  I would say one of the core strengths of Burlington is that we're fairly humble and self-critical. And our teams are very focused on learning and improving our own execution of the off-price model. So let me talk about opportunities, and I'll start with merchandising. There are some businesses where we've done really well year-to-date. Some of our center core businesses, some of our home categories have shown very strong performance. We've delivered great value in these businesses and the customers responded we planned and managed those businesses cautiously and then we chased and that worked really well.  There are other categories where performance has not been as strong. In some of those underperforming areas, we may have over planned sales. So we bought into certain styles and fashions. But then the trend shifted and because we'd over-plan sales, it was difficult for us to react. Now those types of mistakes will happen, especially in fashion businesses where the trend can shift quickly. But the bottom line is that we need to plan cautiously and be much more agile and I'm pretty confident -- I'm very confident that in those businesses, we're going to perform a lot better in 2024. That's also why I'm very excited about the new merchandising 2.0 process and tools that we've rolled out this year. They're really going to help us be more nimble, more agile and they're really going to make a difference over time.  Let me move on and talk about improvements and changes that we've made in other areas, operational areas. Earlier on this call, Kristin discussed some of the work that we've been doing in supply chain to drive efficiency and flexibility. So I'm going to focus just a few comments on stores. There are some aspects of store operations where we've made huge progress in the last few years. In particular, stores receive and move merchandise much faster now than they've ever done before. There's a lot more emphasis on getting fresh receipts out to the sales floor.  And that matters, it's really helped us to drive inventory turns and it's really contributed to the lower markdowns we've been able to achieve. Now part of that is stores have also gotten much more nimble at flexing the sales floor based upon receipts. We flex up businesses that are doing well. We checked down businesses that are not. Now there are other aspects of store performance where we know we can do a lot better, speed of checkout, sales floor recovery, asset protection, scheduling staff, payroll allocation Burlington 2.0 is not just about buying great merchandise. It's also about delivering those great values and a neat, clean and controlled environment. We've strengthened our leadership team in stores. I'm really excited about the team that we have. We've already begun to see some improvement, but I think that we have a lot more opportunity ahead of us, a lot more to come. \nJohn Kernan : All right. Just a follow-up for Kristin. Can you walk us through the gross margin and SG&A puts and takes for Q3 and also the Q4 implied guidance? \nKristin Wolfe : Sure. John, overall, for Q3, we're pleased with the EBIT margin performance in the quarter, increasing 210 basis points over last year. That's after excluding those Bed Bath & Beyond expenses. And as I shared in the prepared remarks, merchandise margin was the primary driver here, increasing 150 basis points. This was really due to lower markdowns, followed by freight, which leveraged 50 basis points and these line items came in largely as we expected. SG&A also came in about what we expected 10 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to the investments we made in store payroll.  Now excluding the approximately $10 million of Bed Bath & Beyond worth about 40 basis points in SG&A. In Q3, the upside in our EBIT margin versus our guidance was primarily driven by product sourcing costs coming in a bit lower than we had planned. Now as far as Q4 is concerned, directionally, the margin dynamics will be similar to Q3. We expect merchant margins to be up as well as continued freight leverage. However, we do expect this gross margin leverage to be partially offset by SG&A deleverage due to 2 factors: one, investment in store payroll as we did in the third quarter. And then secondly, the fact that we are up against an incentive comp accrual reversal that benefited the fourth quarter last year by about 50 basis points. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley. \nAlex Straton : Congrats on a great quarter. My first one, I think, is for really Kristin, can you perhaps break down the drivers of comp growth in the quarter, maybe by traffic, basket, et cetera? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nKristin Wolfe : Sure. Alex. The third quarter comp was driven by an increase in both traffic and conversion, which translates, of course, to our comp being driven by an increase in the number of transactions. We did see higher units per transaction, but this was largely offset by lower AURs. As a result, our average transaction size was flattish. I would add here that this is a familiar pattern. We've seen all year. Our comp year-to-date has consistently been driven by higher traffic and conversion, i.e., the number of transactions and this is a trend that we've seen pretty much across the off-price sector. \nAlex Straton : That's super helpful. Can you also provide commentary on your inventory levels exiting the quarter? \nKristin Wolfe : Great. Thanks. Yes, our comp store inventory was relatively flattish, up about 2%. Total inventory was down 8% now the biggest driver of that decrease was lower reserve inventory and lower in transit. And I can provide just a little bit of color on each of these.  First, on reserve. In the third quarter last year, we significantly built up reserve inventory. One of the key reasons for doing that was that we were concerned about industry-wide supply chain disruption and delays in Q4 so we brought goods in early, and we stage them in reserve.  Now this year, the environment is very different, and there's been no need to bring in receipts in early. And in addition, again, because of those supply chain delays last year, we had an unusually high level of in-transit inventory. And this inflated our overall inventory levels. This year or in transit inventory is much lower and at a more normalized level. Our supply chain teams are doing a great job moving goods quickly through the DCs and flowing product to stores. Our reserve penetration as a percent of inventory at the end of the third quarter was essentially flat to last year, 30% versus 31% and I'll just add that we feel really good about the content of this inventory and the availability of reserve bus remains quite strong. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Operator, last question. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Brooke Roach. \nBrooke Roach: I was hoping you could elaborate on the drivers of what gives you confidence in delivering a 2% comp result in 2024? Relative to the more cautious outlook embedded in the fourth quarter outlook, understanding that you have delivered a 5% year-to-date. Just trying to understand the more cautious outlook for fourth quarter and then the improvement into next \nMichael O'Sullivan: Brooke, I'll take that. Of course, most retailers do not give guidance for the year ahead until they get through Q4. And as Kristin said in her remarks, our final guidance, our formal guidance for 2024 will be informed by developments over the next few months, of course, it will. We need to get through Q4 to really. Before we're ready to give final guidance Nevertheless, let me sort of -- I think it's helpful at this point to share our initial thinking and that's what we've tried to do in terms of putting that 2% comp growth out there. So let me explain why we think that an appropriate assumption at this point. And we recognize that next year, there's lots of concern and uncertainty about the economy, about lower income shoppers, other risks but with all that said, there are 3 reasons why we think a 2% comp growth is appropriate.  The first and we've touched on some of these during our remarks today. The first is that -- the lower income customer who was really struggling in 2022 has stabilized and is even starting to show some signs of improvement. Now I know analysts are worried about the economy next year, and they're worried about that customer for next year. But frankly, that customer was already -- already went through a lot in 2022. So I think with the cost of living, if the cost of living continues to grow at a slower pace, I think that customer will continue to -- they'll feel relief, and I think they'll continue to recover.  Secondly, as I said earlier, we've also seen some trade down traffic this year. When I look at when I look at our business, we're getting really good turns on recognizable brands at higher price points. And when I look at some specific merchandise categories, it's clear that we're attracting that trade-down customer and it's supposing that the economy does slow down next year, I think we'll likely see more of that trade-down customer and then the third thing I'd say is when we look within our own business this year, there were things this year that we could have done better in every quarter so far this year in Q1, in Q2 and in Q3 there were businesses where I know we could have done better.  And I mentioned some of those a little bit earlier. So there are lessons that we're taking away from this year that we can apply to next year. So if I put those 3 things together, we feel pretty we have some confidence in the 2% comp growth assumption at this point. \nBrooke Roach: Great. And then for Kristin, can you elaborate on your capital allocation priorities beyond the step-up in CapEx that was identified in the prepared remarks? What contribution potential do you see the long term to the long-range model from share buyback? And how are you evaluating the potential near-term cadence of buybacks, given your confidence in the Burlington 2.0 plan? \nKristin Wolfe : Want to take that? \nDavid Glick: Yes, I'll take that one, Kristin. Thanks, Brooke, for the question. Our first priority always is to invest in our growth, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks, the reasons why we're stepping up but that said, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow in our 5-year plan to return excess cash to shareholders. You probably noted that in the fourth quarter, we did, in fact, step up our -- excuse me, in the third quarter, we did step up our buybacks versus the second quarter, about double the previous quarter. We don't guide to buybacks. But you probably also noted in our release today, we had over $600 million in cash and $1.4 billion in liquidity. So we're in a really strong liquidity position. So our expectation is that we'll continue to return cash to shareholders at appropriate levels. We're cognizant of our current valuation. As you heard today, we're confident in our future growth and margin prospects.  We had over $700 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the third quarter. And as we always do, we'll update you on our next quarter call on our buyback activities. \nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Michael O'Sullivan for closing remarks. \nMichael O'Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today, and Happy Thanksgiving. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional details on the third quarter. Total sales growth in the quarter was 12%. This was slightly lower than we had expected, driven by later opening dates for new stores during the quarter as well as a shift in a handful of new store openings into the fourth quarter. In Q3, we opened 38 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 977 stores. For the full year, we now expect to open approximately 80 net new stores. Our comp sales growth in Q3 was 6%, which was the midpoint of our range of 5% to 7%.  As Michael described, we were very pleased with our comps trend through September had then softened due to unseasonably warm temperatures in October. As a point of reference, at this time of year, cold weather merchandise categories, such as outerwear, represent about 25% of our business. Many shoppers still think of us as Burlington Coat Factory. So as you would expect, our comp trends strengthened when the weather finally turned cooler at the start of November. Our adjusted EPS in Q3 was $1.10, which was near the high end of our range of $0.97 to $1.12. This result and the guidance range excludes approximately $10 million of expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we acquired earlier this year.  As a reminder, these expenses are mostly dark rent for the period between the acquisition of the leases and this time that the stores will open. The gross margin rate for Q3 was 43.2%, an increase of 200 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 150 basis point increase in merchandise margin, mostly driven by lower markdowns and a 50 basis point decrease in freight expense. Product sourcing costs were 10 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher supply chain costs. These costs have been a headwind all year. But as we have discussed, we have identified and developed a number of specific initiatives to drive efficiency savings and labor productivity improvements in our distribution centers over the next few years.  Adjusted SG&A costs in Q3 were about 50 basis points higher than last year, which included 40 basis points of deleverage attributable to expenses related to the recently acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding those expenses, the slight SG&A deleverage was driven by a deliberate decision to increase staffing levels in our stores. We were not happy with the service levels in our stores last year and the increase in store payroll is intended to address this. Our Q4 guidance and our initial plans for 2024 include this additional store payroll. Q3 adjusted EBIT margin was 4.8%. 210 basis points higher than last year compared with guidance of 170 basis points to 220 basis points. Again, this excludes Bed Bath and Beyond costs worth 40 basis points.  Turning to Q4. As Michael mentioned, we are maintaining our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance is based on comp sales of negative 2% to flat versus last year. We expect that this current range should lead to a Q4 adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.25. Including the 53rd week, which has adjusted EPS of approximately $0.05 Q4 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30.  Now I would like to share some additional details on our long-range financial model. These additional details may be useful to understand our underlying assumptions in developing this model.  Starting with new stores. We expect to average about 100 net new store openings a year over the next 5 years. As we have described previously, we expect new stores to open at about 70% of our average store volume. New stores joined the comp base about 15 months after opening. And then they typically out comp the chain for several years. As a reminder, our underwriting hurdles for new stores require that they be EBIT accretive in their first full year with the relevant performance title being based on our 2019 EBIT margin. Over the next 5 years, we also expect to relocate a substantial number of our older less productive oversized stores.  When we relocate a store, we typically see a comp sales lift for that store and improved profitability. The comp lift averages about 10%. The new store is usually close to the old location within a 0.5 mile, but it's typically in a better and busier sensor. Our goal when we relocate a store is to retain the existing customer and also importantly, to pick up new customers' traffic. As Michael described, we expect that our new store openings, together with mid-single-digit comp sales growth should drive low double-digit total sales growth over the next 5 years.  Now let me review our long-range assumptions for operating margin. We have identified savings opportunities unrelated to sales leverage, that are worth about 200 basis points. We believe that we can capture most of these savings in the next few years. In addition, over the next 5 years, we expect about 200 basis points of expansion, driven by the leverage on total sales and on comp sales growth. This means that if sales perform in line with our projections, then we anticipate that our operating margin over the next 5 years should increase to approximately 10%.  The pace at which this happens will depend on year-to-year sales growth. One other point to call out is that in order to support new store growth and the expansion of distribution center capacity, we are planning to increase our CapEx spending. We expect CapEx to run at about 7% of sales for the next few years before dropping back to around 5% of sales. We expect to generate a lot of cash in the next 5 years sufficient to fund the growth needs of the business while still returning excess cash to shareholders.  Let me wrap up with some additional details on how we are thinking about 2024. We are in the midst of our 2024 budgeting process. But right now, our working assumption is for top line growth of about 11%. This is driven by 2% comp store sales growth plus 100 net new store openings. We also expect about 30 store relocations in 2024. As described earlier, in 2024, with 2% comp sales growth, we expect to capture about 50 basis points of margin expansion. We have more work to do, but we feel good about our detailed plans for going after these savings. As a reminder, we typically generate 10 to 15 basis points of operating margin leverage for each point of comp ahead of the sales plan.  Of course, the comments that we have made today regarding our 2024 plans are preliminary and subject to change based on the developments over the next few months. We will provide final guidance in more detail during our Q4 call in early March.  I will now turn the call back to Michael Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. As you said, and we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to capture about 200 basis points of margin expansion in the next few years, unrelated to sales leverage. There are really 3 main sources of these savings. First is higher merchandise margin. This is mostly driven by lower markdowns and while we have made meaningful progress increasing merch margins, but we continue to believe we have opportunity to turn faster and reduce markdowns further.  The second area is in lower freight expenses these savings in freight are driven by lower freight rates as well as specific transportation initiatives that we have to optimize outbound and inbound processes and drive efficiencies throughout our transportation. We've made good progress on freight. By the end of this year, freight will be less than 100 basis points higher than 2019 levels, and we believe that we can recover more of this in the next few years. The third area is the third area of opportunity is from lower supply chain expenses, really driven by productivity and efficiency initiatives in our DCs.  As you know, and as we've talked about, we've significantly increased the level of closeout or true off-price buys. These all require more time to process in distribution centers. We've also substantially increased our use of reserve inventory. So we've had a significant number of learnings, and we're focused on numerous efficiency initiatives to: one, reduce labor hours and processing these buys two: more efficiently manage the flow of goods in and out of reserves. And lastly, to minimize the number of touches in our distribution center and finally, as it relates to the last part of your question as it relates to 2024, we expect 50 basis points of EBIT expansion on a 2 comp.  And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're still in the midst of the budgeting process. We have more work to do. But at this point, we have good line of sight and fairly detailed plans for going after this 50 basis points of margin expansion and it includes a combination of leverage from these 3 items we talked about, merch margin, freight expenses and supply chain. Ike, good morning. Thanks for the question. Quickly, as a point of clarification, we were able to acquire 2 additional leases from Bed Bath & Beyond. So the total is now 64 leases through the bankruptcy process. And as a quick reminder, we prioritized these leases based on nonfinancial and financial criteria. So the nonfinancial criteria included strategic factors like the location, the specific market as well as competitive and site particular site-specific aspects, the strip center, the co-tenancy, the demographics.  And then on the financial side, we ensure that these new stores met our financial hurdles, taking into account rent levels, including the dark rent will be incurred before we stored open the expected volumes, operating margins, the CapEx and obviously, the expected rate of return. So we're pleased that we will open approximately half of these 64 stores we acquired in fiscal '23 and we'll open the other half in early 2024. Now because we're incurring occupancy costs in these locations, we prioritize these stores. We're pushing to get them open as quickly as possible. And of course, prioritizing these stores meant some of our non-Bed Bath & Beyond store openings flipped into next year. Thus, our overall net new store count for the year is 80 net new stores at the high end of our original plan. Now this group of stores will also enable us to open that 100 net new stores in 2024. And then the last point I want to make is it's important to call out, there are many other former Bed Bath & Beyond stores that have reverted to the landlord. And it's likely we'll pursue many of these stores with the landlords over the next couple of years and these stores would form an important part of our normal new store pipeline. I'll take that question. As you said, our long-range model has 3 drivers of earnings growth. New stores, comp sales growth and margin expansion. Now of course, to maximize shareholder value and to achieve our full potential, we will aggressively go after all 3 of these drivers. We believe that we have significant opportunity in each of them. But I'll spend just a minute to your question on comp sales growth. We expect over the next several years, off-price retail will continue to take share from other retail formats. This will come as new store growth and as comp sales growth.  Now we've improved and we've invested in our business over the last few years to make the assortments in our stores as compelling as possible to make sure we are offering great value, and we are very confident that these improvements are going to drive significant comp sales growth over the next several years. That is what is in our long-range model. But yes, hypothetically, you are correct in your question, even with low single-digit comp growth, our business has significant earnings power, driven by new store growth an operating margin expansion that's unrelated to comp growth that we've talked about. But I just want to underscore one last point here. We believe and we expect that we're going to drive significant comp sales growth over the next several years.  So even though it may be true that we can drive earnings growth with a low single-digit comp, we would not be happy with that performance as that would not be full potential. Sure. John, overall, for Q3, we're pleased with the EBIT margin performance in the quarter, increasing 210 basis points over last year. That's after excluding those Bed Bath & Beyond expenses. And as I shared in the prepared remarks, merchandise margin was the primary driver here, increasing 150 basis points. This was really due to lower markdowns, followed by freight, which leveraged 50 basis points and these line items came in largely as we expected. SG&A also came in about what we expected 10 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to the investments we made in store payroll.  Now excluding the approximately $10 million of Bed Bath & Beyond worth about 40 basis points in SG&A. In Q3, the upside in our EBIT margin versus our guidance was primarily driven by product sourcing costs coming in a bit lower than we had planned. Now as far as Q4 is concerned, directionally, the margin dynamics will be similar to Q3. We expect merchant margins to be up as well as continued freight leverage. However, we do expect this gross margin leverage to be partially offset by SG&A deleverage due to 2 factors: one, investment in store payroll as we did in the third quarter. And then secondly, the fact that we are up against an incentive comp accrual reversal that benefited the fourth quarter last year by about 50 basis points. Sure. Alex. The third quarter comp was driven by an increase in both traffic and conversion, which translates, of course, to our comp being driven by an increase in the number of transactions. We did see higher units per transaction, but this was largely offset by lower AURs. As a result, our average transaction size was flattish. I would add here that this is a familiar pattern. We've seen all year. Our comp year-to-date has consistently been driven by higher traffic and conversion, i.e., the number of transactions and this is a trend that we've seen pretty much across the off-price sector. Great. Thanks. Yes, our comp store inventory was relatively flattish, up about 2%. Total inventory was down 8% now the biggest driver of that decrease was lower reserve inventory and lower in transit. And I can provide just a little bit of color on each of these.  First, on reserve. In the third quarter last year, we significantly built up reserve inventory. One of the key reasons for doing that was that we were concerned about industry-wide supply chain disruption and delays in Q4 so we brought goods in early, and we stage them in reserve.  Now this year, the environment is very different, and there's been no need to bring in receipts in early. And in addition, again, because of those supply chain delays last year, we had an unusually high level of in-transit inventory. And this inflated our overall inventory levels. This year or in transit inventory is much lower and at a more normalized level. Our supply chain teams are doing a great job moving goods quickly through the DCs and flowing product to stores. Our reserve penetration as a percent of inventory at the end of the third quarter was essentially flat to last year, 30% versus 31% and I'll just add that we feel really good about the content of this inventory and the availability of reserve bus remains quite strong. Want to take that?"

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will share a few comments on our third quarter results and our forecast for the rest of the year. But then we are going to devote most of our remarks talking about our longer-range financial expectations. We will also provide some early thinking on the outlook for 2024.  Okay. Let's start with our Q3 results. Comp store sales for the third quarter increased 6%. This was the midpoint of our guidance range of 5% and to 7%. During the quarter, we were very pleased with our back-to-school trends. Our quarter-to-date comp growth through September were slightly ahead of our guidance range, but then unseasonably warm weather in October slowed this trend. Of course, we have a very strong heritage in outerwear.  So warmer temperatures in October tend to have a more negative impact on us compared to other retailers. Overall, given this unfavorability in weather as well as the general softness across discretionary retail, we were pleased with our third quarter performance. For the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our previously issued comp store and adjusted EPS guidance. We are up against our toughest multiyear compares and the external economic environment is uncertain. Our guidance is for comp growth in the range of negative 2% to flat. We are pleased that November is off to a solid start, but the highest volume weeks are still ahead of us. I'm going to move on now and talk about our longer-range financial model.  Some time ago, we had said that we would update our longer-range model this year. I am going to share the main headlines from this model, and then I will discuss the key assumptions behind these headlines. While any long-range model is, of course, subject to various uncertainties we think it is important and helpful for investors as well as vendors, landlords and other constituents to understand where we are headed.  Okay, the main headlines. Over the next 5 years, we expect to grow our total sales to approximately $16 billion. This represents about 60% of aggregate growth versus 2023. We project that our average growth rate each year for total sales will be in the low double digits. We expect our operating income over this period to grow to approximately $1.6 billion. In dollar terms, this is almost 3x our forecasted 2023 operating income. As a percentage of sales, we expect our operating margin to be approximately 10% by 2028. The assumptions that underpin this financial model can be grouped into 3 main buckets: new store sales, comp store sales and operating margin.  Starting with new store sales. Over the next 5 years, we now expect to open approximately 500 net new stores on our current pace of over 1,000. These will be comprised mostly by our 25,000 square foot prototype located in busy script malls.  We feel very good about the economics of these stores. We also plan to relocate or downsize a substantial number of our older, less productive and oversized locations. We anticipate 2 to 3 dozen of these store relocations and downsizes each year. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute these new store openings and relocations. As you would expect, our plans for 2024 are well advanced. And our new store pipeline beyond 2024 looks healthy. There may be some lumpiness year-to-year, but still, we expect to achieve the aggregate number of net new openings that I have just outlined.  We anticipate that this new store opening program will be the most significant driver of our annual double-digit total sales growth. I'm going to move on to comp sales growth. Looking at the next 5 years as a whole, we expect that our average annual comp sales growth will be in the mid-single digits. The starting point for this average annual mid-single-digit comp assumption is that prior to 2020, our average comp growth was in the range of 3% to 4%. This comp trend was interrupted by the pandemic. And over the last 3 years, it has been positive 15% followed by minus 13%. And now for fiscal 2023, we are forecasting positive 3%. We anticipate some continued variability year-to-year. In some years, our comp growth may be below mid-single digits and in some years, it may be above.  That said, we believe that the extreme pandemic era volatility is now behind us. In fact, this is evident in our 2023 year-to-date comp trend. As we look at the outlook for off-price and for our core customer over the next 5 years, we think that this 3% to 4% baseline is a good starting point for our model. But there are strong reasons why we believe we can outperform this baseline over the 5-year period. Firstly, since 2019, we have taken numerous steps to make our business more off-price these steps have included strengthening our merchandising capabilities and making our operational processes more flexible. These are not unproven strategies. They have driven the success of our off-price peers over many years. We recognize that over the last few years, we have introduced a lot of change all at once. And this has impacted our ability to achieve the level of execution that we would have liked.  Also, we have been rolling out these changes -- at the same time, as the external environment has been difficult. Since early 2022, our core customer has been under significant economic pressure. But let me get back to my main point. It is important to understand that leaving aside for short-term challenges, the strategies we have been pursuing to become more off-price are not unproven strategies. Over the next few years, we expect these strategies and our improved execution of these strategies have a growing and positive impact on our results.  In addition, our new store and relocation programs have the potential provide a helpful comp tailwind over time. This will not happen right away. In fact, as we ramp up our new store openings, in 2024, there will be some slight cannibalization of comp stores by the newer stores. But then as the new stores join the comp base, they typically out-comp the chain for several years. As more and more new stores join our comp base, we believe this tailwind to comp growth could increase. One other point to note is that when we relocate older stores, we typically see a nice sales lift.  This makes sense. We are moving to a better, more up-to-date store in a busier location. We expect that this could be an additional comp tailwind in in the next few years as we increase relocations. Okay. I am going to move on now and talk about our operating margin. Based on our latest 2023 forecast, we have lost about 300 basis points of operating margin since 2019. This has been driven by higher supply chain costs, mostly labor rates and higher freight costs. In the next 5 years, we expect to offset all of this, 300 basis points and more, taking operating margins to approximately 10% in 2028.  Let me describe the key components of this expansion. Firstly, there are a number of savings opportunities that are unrelated to sales growth. We estimate that these are worth about 200 basis points. And we expect to capture the majority of these savings over the next few years, starting with about 50 basis points in 2024. There are 3 main sources of these savings. Higher merchant margin, mostly lower markdowns, lower freight expenses, partially from lower freight rates, but also driven by specific transportation initiatives and lower supply chain expenses again, driven by specific efficiency and labor productivity initiatives. There may be additional upside in supply chain expenses through investments in distribution center automation. But our expectation is that these benefits may take longer than 3 years and we have, therefore, not included them in these savings estimates.  The second major source of margin expansion is sales leverage. There are 2 forms of this total sales leverage and comp sales leverage. By growing total sales at double-digit rates, we expect to capture leverage on G&A costs, including buying and planning expenses and costs related to corporate functions. In addition, if we grow comp sales at mid-single-digit rates, and we should be able to leverage store-related fixed costs such as occupancy -- over the next 5 years, we expect to capture about 200 basis points of margin from these sources of sales leverage. Let me segue now to our initial thinking on 2024. Although we believe that over the next 5 years, we can achieve average annual comp sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are planning 2024 more cautiously than this. There is a lot of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainties.  It is difficult to predict what this uncertainty might mean for our business. In addition, over the past couple of years, we have implemented a lot of changes in our business, and we think that it makes sense to be cautious about how quickly these changes may have an impact. So for 2024, our initial forecast is for 2% comp growth. With this 2% comp growth, we expect to capture about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion next year.  At this point, I would like to hand the call off to Kristin to discuss more financial details on Q3, our long-range model and 2024. Thank you, Kristin. Let me summarize the key points that we have discussed this morning. First of all, briefly on Q3, given the softness across retail and the unfavorable weather in October, we are pleased with our Q3 comp and earnings performance. Meanwhile, November is off to a solid start, and this gives us confidence in our previously discussed Q4 guidance. Secondly and more importantly, we have spent most of these remarks talking about the longer-term outlook. The last few years have been extraordinarily volatile and unpredictable. But that volatility has started to wane. We are very bullish about the prospects for our business. We expect to grow our top line sales by about 60% in the next 5 years driven by our new store opening program and comp store sales growth.  We also see significant opportunity to recover and drive our operating margin. Compared to 2023, we expect our operating margin in dollar terms to almost triple in the next 5 years. Lastly, for 2024, we are developing our initial plans based on 2% comp store sales growth and 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. If the underlying sales trend turns out to be stronger, then we will be ready to chase. And if we achieved sales above plan, then we would expect additional operating margin expansion.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Matt, thank you for the question. The direct one is that it's a bit of both. There are valid reasons to be cautious and it makes sense to manage our business this way. Clearly, there's a lot of concern and anxiety among analysts and investors about the external environment, the economy, retail sales and especially about the low-income consumer. And to that, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty about the political and geopolitical environment. We're not economic experts. So it's difficult for us to assess all those risks and to calibrate the potential impact on our business.  We also know that many of the improvements that we've made over the past few years, especially the new tools and processes that we've rolled out in merchandising will take time to gain momentum. They are going to have a significant impact, but that impact is likely to build over time. The last thing I'll say is that when we came into 2023, we had bigger expectations for the strength of our sales trend this year. Our business has gotten stronger this year. Our comp is running at positive 5% year-to-date. But we'd actually hoped for a little bit more. I think that those higher expectations hurt us in some parts of our business, we may have over planned sales.  And then when the trend turned out to be a little weaker, it made it harder for us to pull back. In retrospect, it might have turned out better for us if we plan our business a bit more cautiously this year. So putting all those things together, given all the uncertainty, given the changes we've made in our business, given some of the lessons from this year, we think a 2% comp growth assumption is an appropriate one at this point for our budget for 2024. We hope the trend is stronger. We're very confident that if it is, we'll be able to chase it. Okay. Yes, it's a good question. It's something I've thought a lot about. Let me -- I'm going to describe and editorialize three sets of risks in the model. I'll start with long term or structural risks. This is my third decade in off-price retail. And as long as I've been in the industry, there have always been some commentators who are worried that off-price is going to run out of market share or run out of supply or that it will be eclipsed by some new innovative business model or perhaps some new technology. Now of course, it's important that we always be alert to those kinds of structural risks but I have to say that I'm extremely skeptical. I see nothing out there that seriously threatens the long-term growth of off-price. So at this point, I'm really not that worried about long-term or structural or strategic risks.  The second bucket is short-term risk. These are things that can happen in any given year that can impact the trend such as a spike in inflation or a sharp economic slowdown or some other major disruptive event I'm much more wary of those short-term risks than I am of the longer-term structural. Any long-term structural threats. These short-term factors are, by definition, very hard to predict. The implication for us is that we need to be flexible. If we can plan cautiously and if we tightly control liquidity, inventory levels and expenses, then we'll be in much better shape to react to whatever happens, and that's really the poor principle behind Burlington 2.0. But as I say, I do worry about those short-term risks.  The third bucket of risks is internal. In other words, our own execution. As I said in the script, we've introduced a lot of change in a short period of time. And together with a tough external environment, especially for our core customer over the past 18 months, that's all impact -- it impacted our ability to achieve the level of execution we would have liked. But here's the thing. The changes that we've made are proven strategies. We recognize that it may take time to get the momentum, and it may take time to get the consistent execution that we'd like. But we know that these strategies were.  We know that upside is still ahead of us. So anyway, I guess just sort of summing up my answer, long term or structural risks, we need to watch them. But candidly, I wouldn't be too concerned. Much more concerned about the term risks. We need to plan sales cautiously, then be ready to react and to chase.  And then lastly, internal risks. We've made a lot of changes, but their impact, in my view, is only a question of timing. We're confident that the changes we've made, the strategies we're pursuing are going to drive stronger execution over the next few years. Lorraine. As you know, in 2022, this shopper really struggled with the combination of lower benefits and higher inflation. I would say as the cost of living went up last year, money that those shoppers might have spent at Burlington had to be used instead to pay for higher grocery bills or higher rent or higher gas prices. Now turning to this year, inflation is obviously lower this year. So I would say the situation has improved. The cost of living hasn't gone down, but at least it stopped going up or at least stop going up by as much.  And I think we may be seeing some early evidence that the low-income customer is actually starting to recover at least starting to recover from the shock of last year. One point I would make about this customer is that they go shopping when they have a true need. We think that's why our business did so well going back to school. Every year, kids get bigger and they go back to school, there's a true need. You have to buy them close and supplies. So this low income customer comes out to shop curing back to school and it felt like this year, they had a little more money to spend, certainly versus last year. And I think that's consistent with the point that they may be feeling a little less economic pressure than they were in 2022.  Add to that, I do think our teams do a very nice job delivering great value on opening price points going back to school, not just by opening price points, I mean, merchandise that isn't just cheap, but it has great fashion and quality all at a great value.  Let me move on and talk about the trade-down customer because I think -- and obviously, the trade down customer tends to be a little higher income, moderate to hire income and then more of a wanted deal rather than a net deal shopper. I would say that customer has definitely contributed to our 5% comp growth year-to-date.  We really leaned into that shopping. We've increased the proportion of better and more recognizable brands in the assortment. And we've adjusted our mix of good, better and best. And this has worked well for us this year. There are also -- there are specific categories that I would say we're doing particularly well at with the shopper. Our accessories business, parts of our home business, parts of our ladies apparel business. We've chased and fueled some really nice trends in those categories by delivering a higher mix of recognizable brands and elevated assortments.  Our expectation coming into this year was that the economy would slow down, and that would cause shoppers to become more value conscious, and therefore, we've seen more trade down traffic in our stores. And that has happened, perhaps not to the extent we would have liked, but it has happened. As we look forward to 2024, we think it's possible that we'll see more of that trade down -- if that happens, I think we're in very good shape to take advantage of it. The off-price supply environment continues to be very good, and we have strong and growing access to brands at great values. Thank you. Well, thank you for your question. Let me start my answer by contrasting this year with last year. In 2022, the external environment was very difficult. Business would have been tough, no matter what. But we compounded that tough environment by making some mistakes of our own. And I would say we definitely learned from those mistakes. This year, in 2023, the external environment has gotten a lot better, and our own execution has significantly improved. That said, there's still plenty of room for improvement.  I would say one of the core strengths of Burlington is that we're fairly humble and self-critical. And our teams are very focused on learning and improving our own execution of the off-price model. So let me talk about opportunities, and I'll start with merchandising. There are some businesses where we've done really well year-to-date. Some of our center core businesses, some of our home categories have shown very strong performance. We've delivered great value in these businesses and the customers responded we planned and managed those businesses cautiously and then we chased and that worked really well.  There are other categories where performance has not been as strong. In some of those underperforming areas, we may have over planned sales. So we bought into certain styles and fashions. But then the trend shifted and because we'd over-plan sales, it was difficult for us to react. Now those types of mistakes will happen, especially in fashion businesses where the trend can shift quickly. But the bottom line is that we need to plan cautiously and be much more agile and I'm pretty confident -- I'm very confident that in those businesses, we're going to perform a lot better in 2024. That's also why I'm very excited about the new merchandising 2.0 process and tools that we've rolled out this year. They're really going to help us be more nimble, more agile and they're really going to make a difference over time.  Let me move on and talk about improvements and changes that we've made in other areas, operational areas. Earlier on this call, Kristin discussed some of the work that we've been doing in supply chain to drive efficiency and flexibility. So I'm going to focus just a few comments on stores. There are some aspects of store operations where we've made huge progress in the last few years. In particular, stores receive and move merchandise much faster now than they've ever done before. There's a lot more emphasis on getting fresh receipts out to the sales floor.  And that matters, it's really helped us to drive inventory turns and it's really contributed to the lower markdowns we've been able to achieve. Now part of that is stores have also gotten much more nimble at flexing the sales floor based upon receipts. We flex up businesses that are doing well. We checked down businesses that are not. Now there are other aspects of store performance where we know we can do a lot better, speed of checkout, sales floor recovery, asset protection, scheduling staff, payroll allocation Burlington 2.0 is not just about buying great merchandise. It's also about delivering those great values and a neat, clean and controlled environment. We've strengthened our leadership team in stores. I'm really excited about the team that we have. We've already begun to see some improvement, but I think that we have a lot more opportunity ahead of us, a lot more to come. Operator, last question. Brooke, I'll take that. Of course, most retailers do not give guidance for the year ahead until they get through Q4. And as Kristin said in her remarks, our final guidance, our formal guidance for 2024 will be informed by developments over the next few months, of course, it will. We need to get through Q4 to really. Before we're ready to give final guidance Nevertheless, let me sort of -- I think it's helpful at this point to share our initial thinking and that's what we've tried to do in terms of putting that 2% comp growth out there. So let me explain why we think that an appropriate assumption at this point. And we recognize that next year, there's lots of concern and uncertainty about the economy, about lower income shoppers, other risks but with all that said, there are 3 reasons why we think a 2% comp growth is appropriate.  The first and we've touched on some of these during our remarks today. The first is that -- the lower income customer who was really struggling in 2022 has stabilized and is even starting to show some signs of improvement. Now I know analysts are worried about the economy next year, and they're worried about that customer for next year. But frankly, that customer was already -- already went through a lot in 2022. So I think with the cost of living, if the cost of living continues to grow at a slower pace, I think that customer will continue to -- they'll feel relief, and I think they'll continue to recover.  Secondly, as I said earlier, we've also seen some trade down traffic this year. When I look at when I look at our business, we're getting really good turns on recognizable brands at higher price points. And when I look at some specific merchandise categories, it's clear that we're attracting that trade-down customer and it's supposing that the economy does slow down next year, I think we'll likely see more of that trade-down customer and then the third thing I'd say is when we look within our own business this year, there were things this year that we could have done better in every quarter so far this year in Q1, in Q2 and in Q3 there were businesses where I know we could have done better.  And I mentioned some of those a little bit earlier. So there are lessons that we're taking away from this year that we can apply to next year. So if I put those 3 things together, we feel pretty we have some confidence in the 2% comp growth assumption at this point. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today, and Happy Thanksgiving."

I will now turn the call over to David Glick, Group Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Glick, please go ahead.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our second quarter results. Secondly, I will share our outlook for the rest of the year. And thirdly, I will talk about our new store opening program. Then I will hand the call over to Kristin to walk through the financial details. Okay, let's talk about our Q2 results. Comp store sales for the second quarter increased 4% versus our guidance of 2% to 4%. This represents a 3% comp store sales growth versus 2019 on a geometric GAAP basis. This was very similar to our trend in Q1 and it means that for the spring season as a whole, our comp store sales growth was 4% on a one year and 3% on a four year geometric stat basis. We are a little disappointed with these numbers. As we came into 2023, we guided to 3% to 5% comp growth. Year-to-date, on a four year basis, we are at the low end of this range. We had hoped to do better. As discussed previously, we believe the key external factor negatively influencing our underlying sales trend is the health of the low income shopper, our core customer. This demographic continues to be under significant economic pressure, Increases in the cost of living, which had a huge impact on this customer's discretionary spending last year have moderated but not but of course, these costs are still going up. Add to that, these lower income shoppers have been impacted by lower benefits and lower tax refunds in the first half of 2023. So overall, while there has been some moderation in the headwinds facing this customer, their discretionary spending is still significantly constrained. Our strategy with this customer has been to focus on great value, especially at opening price points. We are pleased with our execution of this strategy, we are driving strong turns and margins at these price points. But this is an area where we can and must continue to improve. As any off price merchant will tell you, showing value at opening price points is one of the most difficult things to do. It's not just about price it's about offering fashion, quality and even a great brand at these low opening prices. I feel much better about our values at opening price points now than I did last year but these values are really critical to our core customer, so we need to get even better and sharper in all aspects of opening price point value. As we have said before, this economic cycle has been unusual in that while low income shoppers, our core customers, have been impacted by inflation, other demographic groups, higher income groups have been relatively [unscathed]. Coming into 2023, we thought it was possible that if the overall economy slowed down then we might see more trade down traffic in our stores and this could potentially offset some of the weakness among our lower income customers. Our strategy for going after these trade down shoppers has been to increase the mix of recognizable brands and to offer great value across good, better, best price points within the assortment. Our merchants have done a nice job executing this strategy. The mix of recognizable brands is much higher now than last year and our values are significantly stronger. Again, this is a strategy that we need to continue to push and improve. Our good, better, best value strategy has been helped by the fact that there is a very strong availability of off price branded merchandise. This strong supply environment means that not only have we been able to increase our mix of recognizable brands at great value, but as Kristin will describe later in the call, we have also been able to drive up our merchant margins. Although we feel good about our execution of this strategy, we have not seen as much trade down activity in our stores as we would have liked. The fact is that the overall economy has not slowed down significantly, unemployment levels remain low. We have seen some trade down traffic, but so far, the impact of this on our trend has been lower than in previous cycles. Let me move on now and talk about our outlook for the rest of the year. It is important to start by putting our year-to-date comp trend into context with our expectations coming into the year. Our comp guidance for the full year was 3% to 5% on a one year and similarly, 3% to 5% on a four year geometric stat basis. This guidance was predicated on three things. Number one, improved execution, which we feel like we've achieved. Number two, some moderation in the impact of inflation on lower income households. As described a moment ago this has happened but it has been partially offset by lower benefits payments and tax refunds. The lower income shopper is still struggling. And number three, an increase in trade down traffic in our stores driven by a slowdown in the economy. Again, as described earlier, the overall economy has not really slowed down. Our actual year-to-date comp growth of 3% on a four year basis is at the lower end of our full year comp guidance range. We are disappointed with this year-to-date trend but given the commentary that I have just provided this trend makes sense. We are now planning the full season based on 2% to 4% geometric comp stack. The midpoint of this range is what we have achieved year-to-date. This means that we are narrowing our full year guidance versus 2022 from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 3% to 4%. In a moment, Kristin will break out the guidance for Q3 and Q4 and she will explain that we are applying the same logic, the same 2% to 4% geometric tax for both quarters. Again, our year-to-date comp trend is the midpoint of this range. Kristin will also discuss the earnings implications of this comp guidance. But before we go there, I would like to provide a brief update on our new store opening program. We are, by far, the smallest of the major off price retailers. And as discussed previously, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our store count. Also, as discussed previously, we are very excited about our smaller store prototype. For a number of historical reasons, our stores have always been much larger than our peers and they have tended to be in less well traffic, less visible and less desirable locations. As a result, our sales productivity per square foot and our individual store economics are inferior to our off price peers. In addition to adding new stores, we have an opportunity to relocate and downsize many of our older and less productive locations. Our stated goal has been to open in excess of 100 net new stores a year. But given the lack of real estate availability over the last few years, we have struggled to hit this number. As we announced in March this year, we expect to open between 70 and 80 net new stores. I'm glad to say that the supply of great real estate locations has opened up significantly over the last several months, driven especially by the winding down of Bed Bath & Beyond. There are two main implications of this that I would like to discuss. Firstly, we have acquired 62 store leases directly from Bed Bath & Beyond. It is unusual for us to acquire leases from another retailer even in the bankruptcy. We would typically wait until the store locations revert back to the landlord. The benefit of acquiring leases directly is that we get to cherry pick the locations that we're most interested in. The downside is that as soon as we acquire the lease, we start paying rent even though it may take six to nine months to prepare the location and open the store. In a moment, Kristin will provide details on these expenses. Given the timing, we do not expect these stores to have a material impact on our net new store count or on our total sales this year. These stores will largely benefit us in 2024. Secondly, in addition to these 62 stores, there are many other former Bed Bath & Beyond locations that may be of interest to us once they are returned to their landlord in the bankruptcy process. So as we look at our pipeline of store locations, we are now much more confident in our ability to open the number of new stores that we would like in 2024. At this point, it is too early to provide specifics on our 2024 new store opening program, but we will do that at a later time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q2, then I will move on to our outlook for the rest of the year. Total sales in the quarter were up 9%, while comparable store sales were up 4%. This means that for the spring season as a whole, our comparable store sales have grown 4% on a one year basis and 3% on a four year geometric stack basis. The gross margin rate in Q2 was 41.7%, an increase of 280 basis points versus 2022's second quarter gross margin rate of 38.9%. This was driven by a merchandise margin improvement of 150 basis points and a 130 basis point decrease in freight expense. The higher merchandise margin was driven by higher markup, lower markdowns and by lower shortage expense versus Q2 of last year. The higher markup reflects the very strong off price buying environment that Michael described earlier. Product sourcing costs were $183 million versus $157 million in the second quarter of 2022, increasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. Buying expense and supply chain costs, both contributed to this deleverage. Adjusted SG&A was $587 million versus $518 million in 2022, increasing 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, largely in line with our expectations, driven primarily by the timing of marketing spend, higher store related costs and higher corporate expense. The Bed Bath & Beyond leases had a 10 basis point negative impact on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 3.1%, 100 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases, adjusted EBIT margin would have been 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.47 versus $0.18 in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.60 versus $0.35 in the second quarter of 2022. The Bed Bath & Beyond related expenses had a $0.03 negative impact on the adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 1% on a comparable store basis. At the end of Q2, reserve inventory represented 45% of our inventory versus 52% last year. In 2022, we had built up our short stay reserve inventory due to the lingering supply chain delays, which are not impacting us this year. Therefore, we are able to carry a lower level of reserve inventory while still taking advantage of a very strong buying environment. As a point of comparison, our reserve inventory is still significantly ahead of prepandemic levels, up nearly 90% since 2019. This reflects the fact that compared with our history, we are making much greater use of reserve to chase off price buying opportunities and hold for later release. During the quarter, we opened six net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the second quarter to 939 stores. This included nine new store openings and three relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Please note that the following guidance excludes costs associated with the leases on 62 stores recently acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond. These expenses, primarily dark rent, will negatively impact the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 by $0.11 and $0.09 per share respectively. Together with the $0.03 impact incurred in the second quarter, this translates to an expected full year negative impact from Bed Bath & Beyond lease acquisitions of $0.23 per share. As Michael described, based on how these store leases were acquired, we immediately incur expenses for these stores while we are remodeling and converting. Revenues and profit from these stores will largely benefit us in fiscal 2024. Of course, this timing was factored into our detailed financial assessment of these lease acquisitions. These store locations had strong pro forma economics and are in locations or strip malls where we would otherwise have a difficult time finding a suitable new store opportunity. So we are very excited to be adding these store locations to our network. We are updating our full year sales and earnings guidance as follows: we now expect full year fiscal 2023 sales to increase 11% to 12%, which includes a comp sales outlook of up 3% to up 4%. Based on this comp sales outlook, we expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 80 to 100 basis points and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.90, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.50 to $6 issued back in March. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of the $21 million of expenses relating to our acquisition of Bed Bath & Beyond leases and includes $0.05 of earnings per share from the 53rd week. As Michael mentioned, we are planning a 2% to 4% increase for the fall season on a four year geometric stack basis. The midpoint of this range is what we've achieved year-to-date. So for the third quarter, we are guiding to a one year comp sales increase of plus 5% to plus 7% which on a four year geometric stack basis translates to a 2% to 4% increase. Based on this comp sales outlook, we expect operating margin expansion of 170 basis points to 220 basis points versus Q3 of 2022 and adjusted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.12. For the fourth quarter, our updated full year outlook implies comp store sales of negative 2% to flat, which, again, is based on a plus 2% to plus 4%, four year geometric comp stack. Based on that outlook, on a 13 week basis, we expect Q4 adjusted EBIT margin to be flat to up 40 basis points and adjusted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.25. When including the $0.05 benefit from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, Kristin. Before we open up the call to questions, I would like to summarize some key points from today's call. Firstly, for the spring season as a whole, we achieved 4% comp growth on a one year basis. This represents a 3% geometric comp stack. We are a little disappointed with these results. We are happy with our major strategies, but coming into the year, we had hoped that external factors would be more favorable. In particular, it is clear that the low income shopper, our core customer is still struggling. Secondly, looking forward to the second half of the year, we are adjusting our guidance to line up with our year-to-date trend. The midpoint of our guidance range for Q3 and Q4 is a 3% geometric debt comp, the same as our year-to-date trend. If the underlying trend is stronger then we are ready to chase it. Thirdly, we are very excited about the opportunities that have opened up to expand our new store and our store relocation programs. We are, by far, the smallest of the major off price retailers and historically, our stores have been physically larger than our peers and have had core economics. The increased supply of attractive real estate locations gives us more confidence in our ability to achieve our new store opening targets over the next few years. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Matthew Boss with JPMorgan, your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter. So Michael, larger picture, maybe compared to broader retail, the big three off price retailers reported healthy same-store sales year-to-date. I guess what's your assessment of how off price is performing relative to other retail channels, and any commentary on the relative performance among the major off price retailers?\nMichael O'Sullivan: I think the first thing I would say is I agree with you. Off price, off price looks like maybe it's starting to pull away from traditional retail. On a one year basis, year-to-date comp performance for the major off price retailers has been in the mid to high single digit range, positive mid to high single digit range whereas for department and specialty stores, it looks like it's mostly been negative. I don't think that that's too surprising. It feels like perhaps we're starting to revert to the longer term structural trends that prevailed before the pandemic, where off price over many years gained share at the expense of other bricks and mortar retail. I think maybe that's what we're going back to. The second point I would make though is that within off price, there continues to be a very significant divergence in relative comp performance between the off price chains, especially when you compare us all on a multiyear basis. When you look at the numbers, we at Burlington, we're at the lower end of that performance range. I think that the factor that perhaps best explains that relative performance is the difference in core customer profiles between the different retailers. Those differences didn't really matter historically. But in the last 18 months, lower income shoppers have been differentially impacted by the higher cost of living and by the scaling down of pandemic era benefits. Our strength -- at Burlington our strength is with shoppers who are younger lower income and more ethnically diverse and in the longer term, this is a really great core customer. But since early 2022, these shoppers have really been struggling. When you look at other discretionary retailers that serve lower income customers, I think you see the same pattern. We all performed differentially well in 2021 and then we've outperformed differentially poorly since early 2022, and I think that correlates with the spending power of lower income shoppers. But let me wrap up my answer by making one final point. I like that our off price peers are doing well, it gives me encouragement. And Burlington 2.0 is all about becoming more off price. But the strong performance of our peers demonstrates, if you like, the art of the possible in off price. We know that right now, we're facing strong customer headwinds and we have been since early 2022, but those headwinds are not going to last. And the strong performance of our peers gives me confidence in off price, but it also suggests that we have a big opportunity once the discretionary spending of our core customer begins to recover from this inflationary cycle.\nMatthew Boss: Maybe, Michael, just a follow-up on your back half guidance. So the logic of basing the forecast on the year-to-date multiyear comp trend it makes sense and seems as if you've derisked the guide. But relative to some other retailers that actually raised the back half and 4Q assumptions, are there any specific concerns that are causing you to be more cautious?\nMichael O'Sullivan: There were really [two] factors that drove our thinking on the updated guidance. Number one, our year-to-date comp trend on a four year bank basis is 3%. It was 3% in Q1 and it was 3% in Q2. So it feels reasonable to reset our guidance for Q3 and Q4 based on this year-to-date four year stack trend. Q3 of last year was our weakest quarter. So that logic means that mathematically, our Q3 one year comp guidance is 5% to 7%, again, consistent with the multiyear trend we've seen year-to-date. I should also add that we're very happy with our sales trend August month-to-date and that trend gives us further confidence in the guide. That said, of course, we're only three weeks into the quarter. The second factor that drove our thinking on our back half guidance is that we know that if the trend turns out to be stronger then we can chase it. In fact, my assessment is that we always perform better when we plan cautiously and then chase that puts us in a stronger position to respond to what the customer is telling us. And in this environment where availability is exceptionally strong, we know we can find great merchandise to support a stronger trend. Now in your question you asked whether there's anything specific, any specific concerns we have that are making us cautious. And the direct answer is no. Of course, there are risks, the impact of student loan repayments or unpredictable weather in October, but we don't have any special insight or intelligence into those. Our continual guidance was much more straightforward, it's based on year-to-date trend and confidence that we can chase the trend if it turns out to be stronger.\nOperator: Irwin Boruchow with Wells Fargo, you line is open.\nIrwin Boruchow: I actually have two questions for Kristin, both on the new stores. I guess, firstly, can you provide any detail on your expectations in terms of new store economics and I guess, in particular, as you're opening more stores over the next few years? How should we be modeling things like new store volumes, four wall margins, margin impact to the stores, just things like that would be helpful?\nKristin Wolfe: I'll first speak to new store sales volumes and then speak to the margin impact from new stores. On sales, for modeling purposes, you should assume that on average, new stores will have sales volumes of about 70% of an average store in their first full year. This equates to about $7 million in sales and then these new stores will then slightly outperform the chain in terms of comp growth for the first few years. On the margin side, while there may be a handful of exceptions but we typically only approve a new store location if we believe it will be accretive to our overall operating margin in year two, and the hurdle we use here is based on our 2019 operating margin. And of course, it's not just about operating margin we also apply an IRR hurdle. On average, new stores have a very attractive IRR. As we've shifted our new store openings towards a greater mix of the smaller prototype locations, we've seen an increase in both sales productivity as measured by sales per square foot but also operating margin per store. The smaller prototype locations, they have superior economics to our older oversized stores. So with that said, though, it's important to point out that when you segment our overall store base, it's still the case that approximately 80% of our stores are larger than 30,000 square feet and about half of our stores are larger than 45,000 square feet. So we still have a lot of oversized and less productive stores in our chain. That's one of the reasons why we're very excited about the expansion of our new store opening program.\nIrwin Boruchow: And then I guess staying on the topic of new stores, Kristin. Curious have you done any analysis on the degree to which the new stores kind of cannibalize your existing stores? I guess specifically is the number of store openings increase, will that create a headwind to comp growth? How do you think about cannibalization?\nKristin Wolfe: Actually, it's a good question. It's something we've looked at. Of course, as you indicated, we know that as we open new stores, we cannibalize older existing stores to some degree. The cannibalization effect is relatively modest, though, when you compare with the incremental sales volume that a new store generates. I can share some additional data here. Over the last four years, we've opened about 250 net new stores. These stores represent about 30% of our 2023 year-to-date sales. And we estimate that this group of stores has cannibalized sales in our existing stores by about 3 to 4 percentage points since 2019. In other words, new stores have represented a headwind of about 1 point of comp each year since 2019. But again, the incremental sales from new stores have far outweighed the cannibalization impact. And I think the last part of your question was getting at what happens as we ramp up new store openings. Of course, we anticipate that, that comp headwind will increase, it's very likely it could exceed a point of comp each year over the next couple of years. But again, the total sales benefit will be significantly higher.\nOperator: Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America, your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Kristin, you said in your prepared remarks that shortage was favorable in the second quarter, which is very different to the broader trend across retail. Can you talk through the reasons for this improved shortage?\nKristin Wolfe: You're right, in the prepared remarks, I noted our storage expense was lower on a year-over-year basis. This was because of the adjustment we made to our shortage accrual in the second quarter of last year based on that quarter's physical inventory. Last year's adjustment was a function of a higher accrual in Q2 as well as a catch-up accrual in Q1 of last year. This had a negative impact last year and the anniversary of this accrual is what drives some gross margin leverage in the second quarter of this year. So that said, we had expected an improvement in our shortage results based on this quarter's physical inventory. Unfortunately, we did not see the benefit we were expecting as the retail industry wide shrink challenges continue and just have not abated. So while we did see a year-over-year shrink benefit in Q2 as compared to the significant headwind we incurred last year, it was just not as much of a benefit as we expected. [Fortunately] our improvement in merch margin taking out the impact of the shrink change still enabled us to have a strong merch margin performance in the quarter. And I'll just -- last point, want to acknowledge that we continue to take steps to control shortage and continue to make significant investments in shortage control initiatives. We believe based on these continued investments, we can mitigate the higher shrink rates over time.\nLorraine Hutchinson: And then my second question is for Michael about the Bed Bath stores. Can you provide any more details on these stores, what kind of process did you go through to select the locations and also what kind of financial hurdles did you apply?\nMichael O'Sullivan: We looked very closely at all of the available Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As I'm sure you know, there were several hundred stores. We had a large internal team of people, real estate experts and legal and finance experts that pull over the data. Typically at retail bankruptcy, the majority of store leases revert back to the landlords. In fact, it's usually our preference to deal with the underlying landlord. That said, it's not uncommon in a bankruptcy process for many locations to be picked off before then. If a retailer has a strong interest in a particular location then it makes sense to acquire it directly rather than to wait. Now there were several specific criteria that we used to identify the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we were most interested in. Those included nonfinancial and financial -- the nonfinancial criteria covered things like strategic factors, for example, is the site in a strategically important location or market. It also covered competitive and, I would say, location-specific factors, for example, do we like the demographics in that trade area and what do we think of the quotas. And then thirdly, we looked at whether or not the site would still likely be available to us if we just waited for it to revert to the landlord. We then, having looked at those nonfinancial factors, we then layered on all of the financial analysis that you would expect. We looked at rent levels, including the dark rent that we would incur before the store would open, we looked at expected sales volumes for the store, projected operating margins, CapEx requirements and perhaps most important of all, we looked at the expected rate of return versus our hurdle. And so based on all those factors, we identified the stores that we were most interested in acquiring directly from Bed Bath & Beyond. I would say that was a fairly rigorous process and we're very happy with the stores that we came away with. I'd also make the point that many other former Bed Bath & Beyond stores will now revert to the landlords. And it's likely that we will pursue many of those stores, again, directly with landlords over the next couple of years. And those locations were just [formed] part of our normal new store pipeline. Before I leave this question though, there probably is one point of clarification that I should make. We may be able to open some of the newly acquired Bed Bath & Beyond stores this fiscal year. As you'd expect, given the fact that we are incurring occupancy costs on those locations, we have an incentive. We will push to get them open as soon as possible. But in prioritizing those stores, it may mean letting some of our non-Bed Bath & Beyond openings slip to early next year. So that's the reason we're saying that we don't expect these newly acquired Bed Bath & Beyond stores to have a material impact on our net new store count or on our total sales in 2023. These stores are really going to largely benefit us in 2024.\nOperator: John Kernan with TD Cowen, your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: I have a couple of [modelling] questions for Kristin. Just first on Q2, the comp growth for the quarter was at the high end of the guidance. Operating margin was also well ahead of the 10 to 50 basis points you had originally guided to, EPS was ahead of guidance. Can you walk us through the main drivers of the margin beat versus your expectations?\nKristin Wolfe: I'll start by saying we're pleased with our margin performance this quarter. What really drove our year-over-year margin increase was on the gross margin line that increased 280 basis points more than offsetting any SG&A and product sourcing cost deleverage we incurred that we have largely expected in the quarter. The gross margin leverage was driven by a 150 basis point increase in merch margin and then a 130 basis point decrease in freight expense. And as Michael noted earlier, the buying environment is very favorable that really helped our markup, and that was the biggest driver in terms of our merch margin. In addition, we benefited from lower markdowns as well as the lower shortage accrual, as I described in the answer to your previous question. The freight decline was driven by both lower ocean freight costs and lower domestic freight costs, including favorable fuel rates. Going forward, we expect freight savings to primarily come from the domestic freight line as we've largely anniversaried the decline in ocean freight at this point. The balance of the P&L, including product sourcing costs and adjusted SG&A was better than we expected as our operating teams manage expenses very tightly during the quarter.\nJohn Kernan: I guess a follow-up for you, Kristin. Apart from the adjustments to the comp guidance in the second half, are there any other factors affecting the EBIT margin and the earnings guidance for the full year for fiscal '23? And just on that note, it doesn't look like the Q2 earnings beat flowed through to the full year guidance. Just helpful -- it\u2019d be helpful to understand your thinking here.\nKristin Wolfe: Let me talk you through the puts and takes. As Michael described, we believe it's prudent to plan our back half sales at the plus 2% to plus 4% four year comp stack, this is aligned with our year-to-date trend. And then we know, of course, if the trend turns out to be stronger, we can effectively chase it. But this updated sales outlook results in a reduction in our fall sales and earnings plan. Full year total sales growth moderates from 12% to 14% to 11% to 12% and overall full year comp range narrows to 3% to 4% from 3% to 5%. The reason the low end full year comp of 3% is maintained versus our original guide, that's really a function of rounding. The reduction in our second half sales and earnings plan offset the earnings beat we saw in Q2. So as a result, after excluding the impact of the Bed Bath & Beyond lease acquisition costs as a result, we are essentially maintaining the low end of our original comp sales and EBIT margin plan and then tightening the range of our adjusted EPS guidance.\nOperator: Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nAlex Straton: I just quickly wanted to dig in on the brief comment you made on student loans. Can you just speak to how you're thinking about the impact of student loan repayments on your consumer going forward? And then I have a follow-up.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Frankly, it's difficult to know what the net impact of student loan repayments will be. The way we've been thinking about it is that there\u2019s a direct impact and indirect impact on us and frankly, they could offset each other. And what I mean by that is the direct impact is that obviously there is a subset of our customers who have student loans. And when the student loan repayments come back up in October, assuming that they will, then those customers will be affected. They'll have less money in their pockets and that could impact their discretionary spending, including their spending at Burlington and net-net, that's not a good thing. The indirect impact is that there's a much broader population of shoppers who maybe don't shop at Burlington today will also be affected by student loan repayments and maybe those shoppers will become more value oriented. In my earlier remarks, I talked about the potential trade down shoppers in our stores. It's possible that the end of the moratorium on student loan repayments could trigger more trade down activity and conversely, that would be a good thing. So the answer is we don't know, it's very difficult to predict what the overall impact will be. That said, I feel like we've planned our business and we're managing our business, so I think we're in a pretty good position to react to no matter what happens.\nAlex Straton: Maybe Kristin, I think you mentioned freight as a benefit to the quarter briefly in the prior question. Can we just revisit that, maybe where does freight stand for you now, how we should think about that factor heading into the back half?\nKristin Wolfe: Yes, as we called out, we made good progress on freight as external freight rates have really moderated. By the end of this year, we would expect to recover about half of the freight delevers we've seen since 2019. Our teams have worked hard to renegotiate our freight contracts and take advantage of a softening freight market, both on ocean and domestic freight and our outlook does factor in more favorable domestic contracts that we've made. Of course, diesel fuel prices could move that number around, so we'll see how that shakes out. Additionally, we are continuing to optimize our inbound and outbound transportation processes and are actively focused on several initiatives that drive transportation efficiency. Well, I'll say, we don't think we'll get all the way back to 2019 freight as a percent of sales but there should be more opportunity to close that gap further beyond 2023.\nOperator: Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett, your line is open.\nChuck Grom: I was wonder if you guys could speak to real estate opportunities beyond 2023? I think you're targeting 70 to 80 stores next year. And maybe a little bit of color on how much the enterprise can handle over the next couple of years, '24 and into '25. And then on near term follow-up would be just category color in the second quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about all the areas and particularly touch on the home business.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the format that Bed Bath & Beyond [leases] that we've been able to acquire over the last few months. As you know over the last few years, we've been trying to get up to 100 net new stores a year. The 62 leases we've acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond, together with our existing pipeline of potential new store locations. So it gives us some -- quite a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to achieve that goal next year. Now as you'd expect, as you ramp up new store openings that puts pressure on things like our -- well, our operating teams, you need to make sure that you have a bench of store managers and store associates. It also puts pressure on our delivery and distribution teams, you need to make sure that you can obviously deliver merchandise to those new stores. And we feel like we've gone through and we've done our homework, and we're prepared for that for next year. So we feel good about that. I think you also, in your question, we're getting at what are the opportunities beyond this year and beyond 2024. And I would say that in addition to the 62 leases that we've acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond, there\u2019s also a very attractive pool of additional store locations that will go back to the landlords from Bed Bath & Beyond, and they should provide us with a pool of new store locations over the next two to three years, I would say. Now obviously, there will be other retailers interested in those locations, too. We know that. But nevertheless, there's an expanded supply of resale locations, which is great. Now also, I should add that although we're talking a lot about Bed Bath & Beyond, there are likely to be other retail closures and bankrupt fees, and there have been smaller retail closures and bankruptcies so far this year. So we actually are feeling very bullish about the pool of potential locations. I guess I'd sort of sum up by saying we have the clearest visibility right now into 2024, and we're very confident we're going to be able to expand our new store program next year. As we look further out beyond 2024, we have slightly less visibility but we have a growing confidence that there'll be an increased availability of attractive locations for at least a year or two after next year.\nChuck Grom: Could you just provide some color on category color in the second quarter? And also, I'm also curious, how your stores in higher income markets performed in the quarter? So two part question.\nMichael O'Sullivan: I think I'll take the category question first. So in the second quarter, our beauty accessories and footwear businesses were our strongest businesses. I think that's sort of been reported by the retailers, so not too much to call out there. I think those are the businesses the customer are really buying right now and I think our merchants did a very nice job chasing into those businesses. In terms of the comparison of home versus apparel, our home business was weaker than our apparel business on a one year basis, but I think that's a little bit of an unfair comparison. Our home business has grown so strongly over the last three or four years because if you look at on a four year basis, our home business is well ahead of our apparel business. So it depends on the basis of comparison. Let me -- I think the last part of your question was higher income stores and higher income locations. We had talked a little bit about this earlier in the year. We regularly slice and dice our stores to understand underlying performance and the degree to which our sales trends are correlating with store characteristics or locations or demographics. And in the last 12 months, we've seen stronger comp performance in our stores that are located in relatively higher income areas versus lower income areas, that's notable because it's the opposite of what we've seen historically. That said, it's consistent with sort of the external macroeconomic environment. Since early 2022, lower income customers have had a tougher time than other income groups. So it's not surprising the relative performance of our stores that are in higher income versus lower income areas is stronger. Now obviously, compared with peers, we have a smaller mix of stores in those higher income areas, and our store base tends to skew much more heavily towards low to moderate income areas. And we believe that those lower income stores are going to come back over time and perform very strongly once we're through the cycle. But right now, the higher -- the stores in higher income areas are out comping the stores in lower incomes.\nOperator: Adrienne Yih with Barclays, your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: My first question is, can you discuss the traffic trends during the quarter? And then relative to your basket, whether that -- if you want to break it down to AUR and UPT that would be great. And then my second question is in each of these kind of Burlington 2.0, the three kind of big areas merchandising, the distribution center, right, investments in there? And then, Kristin, you kind of talked and alluded to about the store -- the kind of store progress. So maybe on the first two, just where are you in that journey? It sounds like the merchant teams are performing and delivering the productivity that you want. But if you can also give me an update on kind of the investments you've made in getting those DCs to act as sort of off-price infrastructure for you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Kristin, why don't you take the question on basket size and then I'll take the question on Burlington 2.0 investments.\nKristin Wolfe: So overall growth in transactions really what drove the comp for the quarter, this is primarily higher traffic but also higher conversion. We also saw gains in higher units per transaction, higher UPT, but that was largely offset by lower AURs as we've expanded opening price points as we've discussed.\nMichael O'Sullivan: And then, Adrianne, on the second part of your question, I'm going to sort of take a broad approach to this. I think it's probably worth, first of all, just stating the key elements of Burlington 2.0. Burlington 2.0 is all about providing the strongest value that we can by executing the off price model more effectively. That means chasing the trend based upon what the customer is telling us and focusing on off price opportunistic buying. And then from an operating point of view, getting those receipts out to the floor in a timely and cost effective way, providing a flexible store environment and driving improved new store economics by reducing the size of the store. So those will look [indiscernible] bits of Burlington 2.0. As we think about it internally, we think about that as sort of four main buckets of activity or investment, if you like. The first is merchandising, which I'll come back to, second is store operations, third is real estate and the fourth is supply chain. On merchandising, we've been -- since 2019, we've been strengthening our merchandising capability, it's really a sort of a core element of Burlington 2.0. Now since 2019, we've invested in growing the merchant team. And then we've also invested in new tools, systems and processes for the merchant, so I think we call merchandising 2.0. We began rolling out those new tools earlier this year and the reception from the merchants has been terrific. Now do I think that they're having -- those tools are having an impact and helping us to improve our execution? Maybe. I actually feel very good about our execution this year. And maybe those tools are starting to have an impact. But I think most of the benefit is yet to come. I think over the next couple of years, I really think we can drive much greater value over the investment -- out of the investments that we've made in merchandising. Let me move on to store operations. We've done a number of things in the last few years to make our stores more flexible, so we can chase sales or pull back based upon the trend and we've also had a lot more focus on getting receipts out to the floor. Now we faced some headwinds because wages have gone up over the last three years, there have been labor shortages in some markets. So that hasn't necessarily gone as smoothly as we would like. But again, I feel pretty good about the progress that we've made there. We're much more flexible in our stores now than we were back in 2019. The third bucket, real estate, I'm not going to talk a lot about because I felt like we've already covered it in some depth today. Our real focus with real estate is to open more stores and to open them using a much more economically advantaged format, which is our smaller store format and we're pleased with the progress we're making there. And then on supply chain, again, there are a number of things that we've been doing over the last few years in freight and supply chain to get our supply chain and transportation system much more flexible, much faster in moving goods. Again, we've run into some serious headwinds just in terms of the freight constraints, the higher freight rates, et cetera. And I feel like this year we've made some real progress in driving down the freight costs. Obviously, we've been helped by that in terms of what's happening externally. And we're also working very hard to drive down supply chain costs, that's going to take a little bit longer. But I think we have some good initiatives underway to sort of drive progress there in the next year or two.\nOperator: This concludes the time allotted for the Q&A session.

            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q2, then I will move on to our outlook for the rest of the year. Total sales in the quarter were up 9%, while comparable store sales were up 4%. This means that for the spring season as a whole, our comparable store sales have grown 4% on a one year basis and 3% on a four year geometric stack basis. The gross margin rate in Q2 was 41.7%, an increase of 280 basis points versus 2022's second quarter gross margin rate of 38.9%. This was driven by a merchandise margin improvement of 150 basis points and a 130 basis point decrease in freight expense. The higher merchandise margin was driven by higher markup, lower markdowns and by lower shortage expense versus Q2 of last year. The higher markup reflects the very strong off price buying environment that Michael described earlier. Product sourcing costs were $183 million versus $157 million in the second quarter of 2022, increasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. Buying expense and supply chain costs, both contributed to this deleverage. Adjusted SG&A was $587 million versus $518 million in 2022, increasing 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, largely in line with our expectations, driven primarily by the timing of marketing spend, higher store related costs and higher corporate expense. The Bed Bath & Beyond leases had a 10 basis point negative impact on adjusted SG&A in the second quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 3.1%, 100 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of the recently acquired Bed Bath & Beyond leases, adjusted EBIT margin would have been 110 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.47 versus $0.18 in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.60 versus $0.35 in the second quarter of 2022. The Bed Bath & Beyond related expenses had a $0.03 negative impact on the adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 1% on a comparable store basis. At the end of Q2, reserve inventory represented 45% of our inventory versus 52% last year. In 2022, we had built up our short stay reserve inventory due to the lingering supply chain delays, which are not impacting us this year. Therefore, we are able to carry a lower level of reserve inventory while still taking advantage of a very strong buying environment. As a point of comparison, our reserve inventory is still significantly ahead of prepandemic levels, up nearly 90% since 2019. This reflects the fact that compared with our history, we are making much greater use of reserve to chase off price buying opportunities and hold for later release. During the quarter, we opened six net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the second quarter to 939 stores. This included nine new store openings and three relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Please note that the following guidance excludes costs associated with the leases on 62 stores recently acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond. These expenses, primarily dark rent, will negatively impact the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 by $0.11 and $0.09 per share respectively. Together with the $0.03 impact incurred in the second quarter, this translates to an expected full year negative impact from Bed Bath & Beyond lease acquisitions of $0.23 per share. As Michael described, based on how these store leases were acquired, we immediately incur expenses for these stores while we are remodeling and converting. Revenues and profit from these stores will largely benefit us in fiscal 2024. Of course, this timing was factored into our detailed financial assessment of these lease acquisitions. These store locations had strong pro forma economics and are in locations or strip malls where we would otherwise have a difficult time finding a suitable new store opportunity. So we are very excited to be adding these store locations to our network. We are updating our full year sales and earnings guidance as follows: we now expect full year fiscal 2023 sales to increase 11% to 12%, which includes a comp sales outlook of up 3% to up 4%. Based on this comp sales outlook, we expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 80 to 100 basis points and our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.90, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.50 to $6 issued back in March. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of the $21 million of expenses relating to our acquisition of Bed Bath & Beyond leases and includes $0.05 of earnings per share from the 53rd week. As Michael mentioned, we are planning a 2% to 4% increase for the fall season on a four year geometric stack basis. The midpoint of this range is what we've achieved year-to-date. So for the third quarter, we are guiding to a one year comp sales increase of plus 5% to plus 7% which on a four year geometric stack basis translates to a 2% to 4% increase. Based on this comp sales outlook, we expect operating margin expansion of 170 basis points to 220 basis points versus Q3 of 2022 and adjusted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.12. For the fourth quarter, our updated full year outlook implies comp store sales of negative 2% to flat, which, again, is based on a plus 2% to plus 4%, four year geometric comp stack. Based on that outlook, on a 13 week basis, we expect Q4 adjusted EBIT margin to be flat to up 40 basis points and adjusted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.25. When including the $0.05 benefit from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30. I will now turn the call back to Michael. I'll first speak to new store sales volumes and then speak to the margin impact from new stores. On sales, for modeling purposes, you should assume that on average, new stores will have sales volumes of about 70% of an average store in their first full year. This equates to about $7 million in sales and then these new stores will then slightly outperform the chain in terms of comp growth for the first few years. On the margin side, while there may be a handful of exceptions but we typically only approve a new store location if we believe it will be accretive to our overall operating margin in year two, and the hurdle we use here is based on our 2019 operating margin. And of course, it's not just about operating margin we also apply an IRR hurdle. On average, new stores have a very attractive IRR. As we've shifted our new store openings towards a greater mix of the smaller prototype locations, we've seen an increase in both sales productivity as measured by sales per square foot but also operating margin per store. The smaller prototype locations, they have superior economics to our older oversized stores. So with that said, though, it's important to point out that when you segment our overall store base, it's still the case that approximately 80% of our stores are larger than 30,000 square feet and about half of our stores are larger than 45,000 square feet. So we still have a lot of oversized and less productive stores in our chain. That's one of the reasons why we're very excited about the expansion of our new store opening program. Actually, it's a good question. It's something we've looked at. Of course, as you indicated, we know that as we open new stores, we cannibalize older existing stores to some degree. The cannibalization effect is relatively modest, though, when you compare with the incremental sales volume that a new store generates. I can share some additional data here. Over the last four years, we've opened about 250 net new stores. These stores represent about 30% of our 2023 year-to-date sales. And we estimate that this group of stores has cannibalized sales in our existing stores by about 3 to 4 percentage points since 2019. In other words, new stores have represented a headwind of about 1 point of comp each year since 2019. But again, the incremental sales from new stores have far outweighed the cannibalization impact. And I think the last part of your question was getting at what happens as we ramp up new store openings. Of course, we anticipate that, that comp headwind will increase, it's very likely it could exceed a point of comp each year over the next couple of years. But again, the total sales benefit will be significantly higher. You're right, in the prepared remarks, I noted our storage expense was lower on a year-over-year basis. This was because of the adjustment we made to our shortage accrual in the second quarter of last year based on that quarter's physical inventory. Last year's adjustment was a function of a higher accrual in Q2 as well as a catch-up accrual in Q1 of last year. This had a negative impact last year and the anniversary of this accrual is what drives some gross margin leverage in the second quarter of this year. So that said, we had expected an improvement in our shortage results based on this quarter's physical inventory. Unfortunately, we did not see the benefit we were expecting as the retail industry wide shrink challenges continue and just have not abated. So while we did see a year-over-year shrink benefit in Q2 as compared to the significant headwind we incurred last year, it was just not as much of a benefit as we expected. [Fortunately] our improvement in merch margin taking out the impact of the shrink change still enabled us to have a strong merch margin performance in the quarter. And I'll just -- last point, want to acknowledge that we continue to take steps to control shortage and continue to make significant investments in shortage control initiatives. We believe based on these continued investments, we can mitigate the higher shrink rates over time. I'll start by saying we're pleased with our margin performance this quarter. What really drove our year-over-year margin increase was on the gross margin line that increased 280 basis points more than offsetting any SG&A and product sourcing cost deleverage we incurred that we have largely expected in the quarter. The gross margin leverage was driven by a 150 basis point increase in merch margin and then a 130 basis point decrease in freight expense. And as Michael noted earlier, the buying environment is very favorable that really helped our markup, and that was the biggest driver in terms of our merch margin. In addition, we benefited from lower markdowns as well as the lower shortage accrual, as I described in the answer to your previous question. The freight decline was driven by both lower ocean freight costs and lower domestic freight costs, including favorable fuel rates. Going forward, we expect freight savings to primarily come from the domestic freight line as we've largely anniversaried the decline in ocean freight at this point. The balance of the P&L, including product sourcing costs and adjusted SG&A was better than we expected as our operating teams manage expenses very tightly during the quarter. Let me talk you through the puts and takes. As Michael described, we believe it's prudent to plan our back half sales at the plus 2% to plus 4% four year comp stack, this is aligned with our year-to-date trend. And then we know, of course, if the trend turns out to be stronger, we can effectively chase it. But this updated sales outlook results in a reduction in our fall sales and earnings plan. Full year total sales growth moderates from 12% to 14% to 11% to 12% and overall full year comp range narrows to 3% to 4% from 3% to 5%. The reason the low end full year comp of 3% is maintained versus our original guide, that's really a function of rounding. The reduction in our second half sales and earnings plan offset the earnings beat we saw in Q2. So as a result, after excluding the impact of the Bed Bath & Beyond lease acquisition costs as a result, we are essentially maintaining the low end of our original comp sales and EBIT margin plan and then tightening the range of our adjusted EPS guidance. Yes, as we called out, we made good progress on freight as external freight rates have really moderated. By the end of this year, we would expect to recover about half of the freight delevers we've seen since 2019. Our teams have worked hard to renegotiate our freight contracts and take advantage of a softening freight market, both on ocean and domestic freight and our outlook does factor in more favorable domestic contracts that we've made. Of course, diesel fuel prices could move that number around, so we'll see how that shakes out. Additionally, we are continuing to optimize our inbound and outbound transportation processes and are actively focused on several initiatives that drive transportation efficiency. Well, I'll say, we don't think we'll get all the way back to 2019 freight as a percent of sales but there should be more opportunity to close that gap further beyond 2023. So overall growth in transactions really what drove the comp for the quarter, this is primarily higher traffic but also higher conversion. We also saw gains in higher units per transaction, higher UPT, but that was largely offset by lower AURs as we've expanded opening price points as we've discussed."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our second quarter results. Secondly, I will share our outlook for the rest of the year. And thirdly, I will talk about our new store opening program. Then I will hand the call over to Kristin to walk through the financial details. Okay, let's talk about our Q2 results. Comp store sales for the second quarter increased 4% versus our guidance of 2% to 4%. This represents a 3% comp store sales growth versus 2019 on a geometric GAAP basis. This was very similar to our trend in Q1 and it means that for the spring season as a whole, our comp store sales growth was 4% on a one year and 3% on a four year geometric stat basis. We are a little disappointed with these numbers. As we came into 2023, we guided to 3% to 5% comp growth. Year-to-date, on a four year basis, we are at the low end of this range. We had hoped to do better. As discussed previously, we believe the key external factor negatively influencing our underlying sales trend is the health of the low income shopper, our core customer. This demographic continues to be under significant economic pressure, Increases in the cost of living, which had a huge impact on this customer's discretionary spending last year have moderated but not but of course, these costs are still going up. Add to that, these lower income shoppers have been impacted by lower benefits and lower tax refunds in the first half of 2023. So overall, while there has been some moderation in the headwinds facing this customer, their discretionary spending is still significantly constrained. Our strategy with this customer has been to focus on great value, especially at opening price points. We are pleased with our execution of this strategy, we are driving strong turns and margins at these price points. But this is an area where we can and must continue to improve. As any off price merchant will tell you, showing value at opening price points is one of the most difficult things to do. It's not just about price it's about offering fashion, quality and even a great brand at these low opening prices. I feel much better about our values at opening price points now than I did last year but these values are really critical to our core customer, so we need to get even better and sharper in all aspects of opening price point value. As we have said before, this economic cycle has been unusual in that while low income shoppers, our core customers, have been impacted by inflation, other demographic groups, higher income groups have been relatively [unscathed]. Coming into 2023, we thought it was possible that if the overall economy slowed down then we might see more trade down traffic in our stores and this could potentially offset some of the weakness among our lower income customers. Our strategy for going after these trade down shoppers has been to increase the mix of recognizable brands and to offer great value across good, better, best price points within the assortment. Our merchants have done a nice job executing this strategy. The mix of recognizable brands is much higher now than last year and our values are significantly stronger. Again, this is a strategy that we need to continue to push and improve. Our good, better, best value strategy has been helped by the fact that there is a very strong availability of off price branded merchandise. This strong supply environment means that not only have we been able to increase our mix of recognizable brands at great value, but as Kristin will describe later in the call, we have also been able to drive up our merchant margins. Although we feel good about our execution of this strategy, we have not seen as much trade down activity in our stores as we would have liked. The fact is that the overall economy has not slowed down significantly, unemployment levels remain low. We have seen some trade down traffic, but so far, the impact of this on our trend has been lower than in previous cycles. Let me move on now and talk about our outlook for the rest of the year. It is important to start by putting our year-to-date comp trend into context with our expectations coming into the year. Our comp guidance for the full year was 3% to 5% on a one year and similarly, 3% to 5% on a four year geometric stat basis. This guidance was predicated on three things. Number one, improved execution, which we feel like we've achieved. Number two, some moderation in the impact of inflation on lower income households. As described a moment ago this has happened but it has been partially offset by lower benefits payments and tax refunds. The lower income shopper is still struggling. And number three, an increase in trade down traffic in our stores driven by a slowdown in the economy. Again, as described earlier, the overall economy has not really slowed down. Our actual year-to-date comp growth of 3% on a four year basis is at the lower end of our full year comp guidance range. We are disappointed with this year-to-date trend but given the commentary that I have just provided this trend makes sense. We are now planning the full season based on 2% to 4% geometric comp stack. The midpoint of this range is what we have achieved year-to-date. This means that we are narrowing our full year guidance versus 2022 from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 3% to 4%. In a moment, Kristin will break out the guidance for Q3 and Q4 and she will explain that we are applying the same logic, the same 2% to 4% geometric tax for both quarters. Again, our year-to-date comp trend is the midpoint of this range. Kristin will also discuss the earnings implications of this comp guidance. But before we go there, I would like to provide a brief update on our new store opening program. We are, by far, the smallest of the major off price retailers. And as discussed previously, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our store count. Also, as discussed previously, we are very excited about our smaller store prototype. For a number of historical reasons, our stores have always been much larger than our peers and they have tended to be in less well traffic, less visible and less desirable locations. As a result, our sales productivity per square foot and our individual store economics are inferior to our off price peers. In addition to adding new stores, we have an opportunity to relocate and downsize many of our older and less productive locations. Our stated goal has been to open in excess of 100 net new stores a year. But given the lack of real estate availability over the last few years, we have struggled to hit this number. As we announced in March this year, we expect to open between 70 and 80 net new stores. I'm glad to say that the supply of great real estate locations has opened up significantly over the last several months, driven especially by the winding down of Bed Bath & Beyond. There are two main implications of this that I would like to discuss. Firstly, we have acquired 62 store leases directly from Bed Bath & Beyond. It is unusual for us to acquire leases from another retailer even in the bankruptcy. We would typically wait until the store locations revert back to the landlord. The benefit of acquiring leases directly is that we get to cherry pick the locations that we're most interested in. The downside is that as soon as we acquire the lease, we start paying rent even though it may take six to nine months to prepare the location and open the store. In a moment, Kristin will provide details on these expenses. Given the timing, we do not expect these stores to have a material impact on our net new store count or on our total sales this year. These stores will largely benefit us in 2024. Secondly, in addition to these 62 stores, there are many other former Bed Bath & Beyond locations that may be of interest to us once they are returned to their landlord in the bankruptcy process. So as we look at our pipeline of store locations, we are now much more confident in our ability to open the number of new stores that we would like in 2024. At this point, it is too early to provide specifics on our 2024 new store opening program, but we will do that at a later time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kristin. Thank you, Kristin. Before we open up the call to questions, I would like to summarize some key points from today's call. Firstly, for the spring season as a whole, we achieved 4% comp growth on a one year basis. This represents a 3% geometric comp stack. We are a little disappointed with these results. We are happy with our major strategies, but coming into the year, we had hoped that external factors would be more favorable. In particular, it is clear that the low income shopper, our core customer is still struggling. Secondly, looking forward to the second half of the year, we are adjusting our guidance to line up with our year-to-date trend. The midpoint of our guidance range for Q3 and Q4 is a 3% geometric debt comp, the same as our year-to-date trend. If the underlying trend is stronger then we are ready to chase it. Thirdly, we are very excited about the opportunities that have opened up to expand our new store and our store relocation programs. We are, by far, the smallest of the major off price retailers and historically, our stores have been physically larger than our peers and have had core economics. The increased supply of attractive real estate locations gives us more confidence in our ability to achieve our new store opening targets over the next few years. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I think the first thing I would say is I agree with you. Off price, off price looks like maybe it's starting to pull away from traditional retail. On a one year basis, year-to-date comp performance for the major off price retailers has been in the mid to high single digit range, positive mid to high single digit range whereas for department and specialty stores, it looks like it's mostly been negative. I don't think that that's too surprising. It feels like perhaps we're starting to revert to the longer term structural trends that prevailed before the pandemic, where off price over many years gained share at the expense of other bricks and mortar retail. I think maybe that's what we're going back to. The second point I would make though is that within off price, there continues to be a very significant divergence in relative comp performance between the off price chains, especially when you compare us all on a multiyear basis. When you look at the numbers, we at Burlington, we're at the lower end of that performance range. I think that the factor that perhaps best explains that relative performance is the difference in core customer profiles between the different retailers. Those differences didn't really matter historically. But in the last 18 months, lower income shoppers have been differentially impacted by the higher cost of living and by the scaling down of pandemic era benefits. Our strength -- at Burlington our strength is with shoppers who are younger lower income and more ethnically diverse and in the longer term, this is a really great core customer. But since early 2022, these shoppers have really been struggling. When you look at other discretionary retailers that serve lower income customers, I think you see the same pattern. We all performed differentially well in 2021 and then we've outperformed differentially poorly since early 2022, and I think that correlates with the spending power of lower income shoppers. But let me wrap up my answer by making one final point. I like that our off price peers are doing well, it gives me encouragement. And Burlington 2.0 is all about becoming more off price. But the strong performance of our peers demonstrates, if you like, the art of the possible in off price. We know that right now, we're facing strong customer headwinds and we have been since early 2022, but those headwinds are not going to last. And the strong performance of our peers gives me confidence in off price, but it also suggests that we have a big opportunity once the discretionary spending of our core customer begins to recover from this inflationary cycle. There were really [two] factors that drove our thinking on the updated guidance. Number one, our year-to-date comp trend on a four year bank basis is 3%. It was 3% in Q1 and it was 3% in Q2. So it feels reasonable to reset our guidance for Q3 and Q4 based on this year-to-date four year stack trend. Q3 of last year was our weakest quarter. So that logic means that mathematically, our Q3 one year comp guidance is 5% to 7%, again, consistent with the multiyear trend we've seen year-to-date. I should also add that we're very happy with our sales trend August month-to-date and that trend gives us further confidence in the guide. That said, of course, we're only three weeks into the quarter. The second factor that drove our thinking on our back half guidance is that we know that if the trend turns out to be stronger then we can chase it. In fact, my assessment is that we always perform better when we plan cautiously and then chase that puts us in a stronger position to respond to what the customer is telling us. And in this environment where availability is exceptionally strong, we know we can find great merchandise to support a stronger trend. Now in your question you asked whether there's anything specific, any specific concerns we have that are making us cautious. And the direct answer is no. Of course, there are risks, the impact of student loan repayments or unpredictable weather in October, but we don't have any special insight or intelligence into those. Our continual guidance was much more straightforward, it's based on year-to-date trend and confidence that we can chase the trend if it turns out to be stronger. We looked very closely at all of the available Bed Bath & Beyond stores. As I'm sure you know, there were several hundred stores. We had a large internal team of people, real estate experts and legal and finance experts that pull over the data. Typically at retail bankruptcy, the majority of store leases revert back to the landlords. In fact, it's usually our preference to deal with the underlying landlord. That said, it's not uncommon in a bankruptcy process for many locations to be picked off before then. If a retailer has a strong interest in a particular location then it makes sense to acquire it directly rather than to wait. Now there were several specific criteria that we used to identify the Bed Bath & Beyond stores that we were most interested in. Those included nonfinancial and financial -- the nonfinancial criteria covered things like strategic factors, for example, is the site in a strategically important location or market. It also covered competitive and, I would say, location-specific factors, for example, do we like the demographics in that trade area and what do we think of the quotas. And then thirdly, we looked at whether or not the site would still likely be available to us if we just waited for it to revert to the landlord. We then, having looked at those nonfinancial factors, we then layered on all of the financial analysis that you would expect. We looked at rent levels, including the dark rent that we would incur before the store would open, we looked at expected sales volumes for the store, projected operating margins, CapEx requirements and perhaps most important of all, we looked at the expected rate of return versus our hurdle. And so based on all those factors, we identified the stores that we were most interested in acquiring directly from Bed Bath & Beyond. I would say that was a fairly rigorous process and we're very happy with the stores that we came away with. I'd also make the point that many other former Bed Bath & Beyond stores will now revert to the landlords. And it's likely that we will pursue many of those stores, again, directly with landlords over the next couple of years. And those locations were just [formed] part of our normal new store pipeline. Before I leave this question though, there probably is one point of clarification that I should make. We may be able to open some of the newly acquired Bed Bath & Beyond stores this fiscal year. As you'd expect, given the fact that we are incurring occupancy costs on those locations, we have an incentive. We will push to get them open as soon as possible. But in prioritizing those stores, it may mean letting some of our non-Bed Bath & Beyond openings slip to early next year. So that's the reason we're saying that we don't expect these newly acquired Bed Bath & Beyond stores to have a material impact on our net new store count or on our total sales in 2023. These stores are really going to largely benefit us in 2024. Frankly, it's difficult to know what the net impact of student loan repayments will be. The way we've been thinking about it is that there's a direct impact and indirect impact on us and frankly, they could offset each other. And what I mean by that is the direct impact is that obviously there is a subset of our customers who have student loans. And when the student loan repayments come back up in October, assuming that they will, then those customers will be affected. They'll have less money in their pockets and that could impact their discretionary spending, including their spending at Burlington and net-net, that's not a good thing. The indirect impact is that there's a much broader population of shoppers who maybe don't shop at Burlington today will also be affected by student loan repayments and maybe those shoppers will become more value oriented. In my earlier remarks, I talked about the potential trade down shoppers in our stores. It's possible that the end of the moratorium on student loan repayments could trigger more trade down activity and conversely, that would be a good thing. So the answer is we don't know, it's very difficult to predict what the overall impact will be. That said, I feel like we've planned our business and we're managing our business, so I think we're in a pretty good position to react to no matter what happens. Yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the format that Bed Bath & Beyond [leases] that we've been able to acquire over the last few months. As you know over the last few years, we've been trying to get up to 100 net new stores a year. The 62 leases we've acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond, together with our existing pipeline of potential new store locations. So it gives us some -- quite a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to achieve that goal next year. Now as you'd expect, as you ramp up new store openings that puts pressure on things like our -- well, our operating teams, you need to make sure that you have a bench of store managers and store associates. It also puts pressure on our delivery and distribution teams, you need to make sure that you can obviously deliver merchandise to those new stores. And we feel like we've gone through and we've done our homework, and we're prepared for that for next year. So we feel good about that. I think you also, in your question, we're getting at what are the opportunities beyond this year and beyond 2024. And I would say that in addition to the 62 leases that we've acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond, there's also a very attractive pool of additional store locations that will go back to the landlords from Bed Bath & Beyond, and they should provide us with a pool of new store locations over the next two to three years, I would say. Now obviously, there will be other retailers interested in those locations, too. We know that. But nevertheless, there's an expanded supply of resale locations, which is great. Now also, I should add that although we're talking a lot about Bed Bath & Beyond, there are likely to be other retail closures and bankrupt fees, and there have been smaller retail closures and bankruptcies so far this year. So we actually are feeling very bullish about the pool of potential locations. I guess I'd sort of sum up by saying we have the clearest visibility right now into 2024, and we're very confident we're going to be able to expand our new store program next year. As we look further out beyond 2024, we have slightly less visibility but we have a growing confidence that there'll be an increased availability of attractive locations for at least a year or two after next year. I think I'll take the category question first. So in the second quarter, our beauty accessories and footwear businesses were our strongest businesses. I think that's sort of been reported by the retailers, so not too much to call out there. I think those are the businesses the customer are really buying right now and I think our merchants did a very nice job chasing into those businesses. In terms of the comparison of home versus apparel, our home business was weaker than our apparel business on a one year basis, but I think that's a little bit of an unfair comparison. Our home business has grown so strongly over the last three or four years because if you look at on a four year basis, our home business is well ahead of our apparel business. So it depends on the basis of comparison. Let me -- I think the last part of your question was higher income stores and higher income locations. We had talked a little bit about this earlier in the year. We regularly slice and dice our stores to understand underlying performance and the degree to which our sales trends are correlating with store characteristics or locations or demographics. And in the last 12 months, we've seen stronger comp performance in our stores that are located in relatively higher income areas versus lower income areas, that's notable because it's the opposite of what we've seen historically. That said, it's consistent with sort of the external macroeconomic environment. Since early 2022, lower income customers have had a tougher time than other income groups. So it's not surprising the relative performance of our stores that are in higher income versus lower income areas is stronger. Now obviously, compared with peers, we have a smaller mix of stores in those higher income areas, and our store base tends to skew much more heavily towards low to moderate income areas. And we believe that those lower income stores are going to come back over time and perform very strongly once we're through the cycle. But right now, the higher -- the stores in higher income areas are out comping the stores in lower incomes. Kristin, why don't you take the question on basket size and then I'll take the question on Burlington 2.0 investments. And then, Adrianne, on the second part of your question, I'm going to sort of take a broad approach to this. I think it's probably worth, first of all, just stating the key elements of Burlington 2.0. Burlington 2.0 is all about providing the strongest value that we can by executing the off price model more effectively. That means chasing the trend based upon what the customer is telling us and focusing on off price opportunistic buying. And then from an operating point of view, getting those receipts out to the floor in a timely and cost effective way, providing a flexible store environment and driving improved new store economics by reducing the size of the store. So those will look [indiscernible] bits of Burlington 2.0. As we think about it internally, we think about that as sort of four main buckets of activity or investment, if you like. The first is merchandising, which I'll come back to, second is store operations, third is real estate and the fourth is supply chain. On merchandising, we've been -- since 2019, we've been strengthening our merchandising capability, it's really a sort of a core element of Burlington 2.0. Now since 2019, we've invested in growing the merchant team. And then we've also invested in new tools, systems and processes for the merchant, so I think we call merchandising 2.0. We began rolling out those new tools earlier this year and the reception from the merchants has been terrific. Now do I think that they're having -- those tools are having an impact and helping us to improve our execution? Maybe. I actually feel very good about our execution this year. And maybe those tools are starting to have an impact. But I think most of the benefit is yet to come. I think over the next couple of years, I really think we can drive much greater value over the investment -- out of the investments that we've made in merchandising. Let me move on to store operations. We've done a number of things in the last few years to make our stores more flexible, so we can chase sales or pull back based upon the trend and we've also had a lot more focus on getting receipts out to the floor. Now we faced some headwinds because wages have gone up over the last three years, there have been labor shortages in some markets. So that hasn't necessarily gone as smoothly as we would like. But again, I feel pretty good about the progress that we've made there. We're much more flexible in our stores now than we were back in 2019. The third bucket, real estate, I'm not going to talk a lot about because I felt like we've already covered it in some depth today. Our real focus with real estate is to open more stores and to open them using a much more economically advantaged format, which is our smaller store format and we're pleased with the progress we're making there. And then on supply chain, again, there are a number of things that we've been doing over the last few years in freight and supply chain to get our supply chain and transportation system much more flexible, much faster in moving goods. Again, we've run into some serious headwinds just in terms of the freight constraints, the higher freight rates, et cetera. And I feel like this year we've made some real progress in driving down the freight costs. Obviously, we've been helped by that in terms of what's happening externally. And we're also working very hard to drive down supply chain costs, that's going to take a little bit longer. But I think we have some good initiatives underway to sort of drive progress there in the next year or two. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late November to discuss our third quarter results. Thank you for your time today."

I would now like to turn the call over to David Glick, Group SVP, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our first quarter results. Secondly, I will talk about our guidance for the second quarter. And finally, I will comment on the full year outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our first quarter results and our 2023 guidance. Then, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let\u2019s talk about our Q1 results. Comp store sales for the first quarter increased 4% versus our guidance of 5% to 7%. On a geometric stack basis, this represents 3% comp store sales growth versus 2019. As I will explain in a moment, we believe that this weaker-than-planned comp growth was driven by two external factors. We started the quarter very strongly. In fact, until mid-March, our comp growth was running up double-digits. As we have described on the last couple of calls, we have had a very strong focus on delivering great value in our assortment, expanding opening price points and offering great brands of well values. This strategy has driven the improvement in the sales trend that we have seen since early Q4 and this strong momentum continued well into the first quarter. Our merchants and operators have done a nice job executing this value strategy. The slowdown in our sales trend that we saw in the first quarter coincided with two external factors. Firstly, the timing of tax refunds. These had run ahead of last year, early in the quarter, but in March, they began to fall off. Refunds ended the quarter well behind last year\u2019s levels and also below 2019 levels. The reason this is important is that tax refunds are the main delivery vehicle for important federal benefits programs like the earned income tax credit and tile tax credit. So, lower income customers are hugely sensitive to lower tax refunds. This is what happened in Q1. Based on our own historic experience, we estimate that lower tax refunds cost us about 1 point of comp growth in the quarter. I think you have probably heard very similar commentary from other retailers that serve lower income shoppers. The second thing that happened or didn\u2019t happen was weather. In the important weeks leading up to Easter, temperatures across the country were cooler than last year. Our warm weather businesses, which were doing well early in the quarter, softened versus the rest of the store in mid-March. So to summarize, we believe that the compound effect of lower tax refunds and cooler weather leading up to Easter was the primary driver of the sharp falloff in our trend in mid-March. Okay. Let me move on and talk about the more recent trend. On a geometric stack basis, we began to see a pickup in the second half of April and this momentum has continued May, month-to-date. This recent pickup reinforces our belief that the slowdown that we saw in mid-March was driven by external transitory factors. We are guiding and managing our business to a comp growth range of 2% to 4% for the second quarter. If the momentum that we have seen since mid-April is sustained, then this guidance may turn out to be conservative. And if this current trend remains strong and our merchants and operators are ready and able to chase it. There is plenty of merchandise supply to support this chase. Overall, as we look ahead to Q2, we feel good. We believe that our strong focus on value and our strategies to support this are working. We need to stay very focused on these strategies and we will. As I have described, we believe that the slowdown in the trend that we saw in Q1 is explainable and attributable to ex-transitory factors, factors that should now be behind us. With that said, we recognize that this is a very uncertain environment and we remain very concerned about the economic health of the lower income customer. So, it makes sense to manage our business cautiously and be ready to chase a stronger trend. Let me move on to the rest of the year. As we communicated in March, our guidance for the full year is for 3% to 5% comp store sales growth. And based on this comp growth, we expect to drive 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion. We are still comfortable with this guidance. We see plenty of risks and uncertainties, but we also see some potential tailwinds. Let me elaborate on three of these potential tailwinds. Number one, last year, our industry was upside down with inventory and this drove huge promotional activity, especially in mass retail. We think that the soft sales trends that many retailers have reported in Q1 are likely to drive higher promotional activity in Q2 but we still anticipate that this promotional activity will be below last year\u2019s levels. This year-over-year lower promotional activity should help our comp trend. Number two, last year, we made the mistake of taking up retail prices in Q2 and Q3, this backfired. Our core customer was and is under significant economic pressure and those higher retails hurt us, especially in the face of the promotional activity that I have just described. This year, our values are sharpened. And again, this should help our trend. And number three, last summer, there were some external headwinds, in particular, higher gas prices that hurt our customer and our trend. Gas prices are now much lower. And unless something happens to drive them back up and this should become a tailwind for us over the next few months. So based on these tailwinds, we feel very good about our full year guidance. The supply environment remains very strong and with our focus on value, we believe that we are well positioned. In our remarks this morning, we have deliberately focused on the drivers of Q1 performance and the near-term outlook for Q2 and the full year. We recognize that given all the economic uncertainty, investors are trying to understand how the year might unfold across retail. So appropriately, there is a strong level of interest in these near-term performance drivers. With that said, I would like to talk for a moment about our Burlington 2.0 initiatives. Over the last couple of years, even as we have been dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath, we at Burlington have been pursuing a comprehensive program to transform ourselves into a more flexible, nimble and efficient off-price business, with a much greater focus on delivering great value to our shoppers. We are not going to cover this in a lot of depth today, but let me say that I am very pleased with our progress. We have made a lot of changes and improvements in buying and planning stores, supply chain and real estate. In upcoming quarterly calls, I will have more to say about these initiatives, but the one callout for today is the work we have been doing in merchandising. Over the last few years, we have significantly grown this organization. We have brought in tremendous talent at all levels and we have also promoted great talent from within. In parallel, we have been investing in and developing new tools, systems and processes to support and leverage this merchandising talent. Internally, we refer to this program as Merchandising 2.0 and it is designed to transform our buying and planning capabilities, enabling greater flexibility to respond to trends and providing clearer visibility through up-to-date and actionable business data and intelligence. We have just begun rolling out many of these new capabilities to the organization. We are excited and the merchants are especially excited about the impact that these will have on our ability to drive improved and more consistent performance and execution over the next several years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, who will share more details on our first quarter financial results as well as our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Kristin?\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q1. Total sales in the quarter were up 11%, while comparable store sales were up 4%. We are disappointed with this outcome. We had planned and guided to stronger comp growth. But as Michael said, we believe that our weaker comp in Q1 was driven by external headwinds, lower tax refunds and cooler weather. If we are right, then these headwinds are temporary and they should abate as we move into the second quarter. The gross margin rate in Q1 was 42.3%, an increase of 130 basis points versus 2022\u2019s first quarter rate of 41%. This was driven by a 150 basis point decrease in freight expense which more than offset a 20 basis point decrease in merchandise margins. This lower merchandise margin was driven by higher markdowns, which in turn were driven by the sudden slowdown in the trend that we saw during the quarter. Product sourcing costs were $187 million versus $157 million in the first quarter of 2022, increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales, higher buying and asset protection costs represented the majority of this deleverage. Adjusted SG&A was $565 million versus $514 million in 2022, decreasing 20 basis points as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by lower store-related costs. Adjusted EBIT margin was 4.1%, 100 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBIT margin was below the low end of our guidance, primarily due to the lower sales versus our guidance. To sum up, the lower-than-planned sales drove higher markdowns and lower SG&A leverage. And this led to the lower-than-planned expansion of our operating margin in Q1. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.50 versus $0.24 in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.84 versus $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 10% on a comp store basis. This is slightly higher than we had planned, again, driven by lower comp sales and plans. As a point of reference, at the end of May, our in-store inventories are now flat to last year on a comp store basis. At the end of Q1, reserve inventory represented 44% of our inventory versus 50% last year. As a reminder, our reserve inventory is still significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels, up about 65% since 2019. This reflects the fact that compared with our history, we are making much greater use of reserve to chase off-price buying opportunities and hold for later release. During the quarter, we opened 6 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 933 stores. This included 13 new store openings and 7 relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year 2023 and for the second quarter. We are reiterating our full year sales and earnings guidance, which includes a comp sales outlook of up 3% to up 5%. Based on this comp sales outlook, we still expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 80 to 120 basis points. This sales and margin outlook translates to an adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $6. This is consistent with the outlook we provided on our Q4 call in March. As a reminder, this includes $0.05 of EPS from the 53rd week. In the second quarter, for the reasons Michael detailed earlier, we are planning and guiding to a comp increase of plus 2% to plus 4%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 10 to up 50 basis points versus Q2 of 2022. This translates to EPS guidance for the second quarter of $0.35 to $0.45. For the back half of fiscal 2023, this outlook assumes comp store sales of plus 3% to plus 6%. EBIT margins to increase 100 to 150 basis points and EPS in the range of $4.31 to $4.71, an increase of 27% to 39% compared to last year. I will now turn the call back over to Michael.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you, Kristin. Before we open up the call to questions, I would like to summarize some key points from today\u2019s call. Firstly, we are disappointed with our Q1 results, especially given the strength that we saw early in the quarter. But we believe that the weakening of the trend that we experienced in March was driven by 2 external factors that are now behind us, specifically, lower tax refunds and cooler weather leading up to Easter. Secondly, we feel very good about our underlying strategies and our focus on delivering strong value to our customers, and we are encouraged by the recent trend that we have seen in our business. We are being cautious in how we are planning Q2, but we are ready to face if the sales trend turns out to be stronger than guidance. And lastly, we remain comfortable with our full year guidance. We see plenty of uncertainty, and we remain concerned about the economic health of the low-income customer, but we also see some potential tailwinds. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks and good morning. So Michael, could you elaborate or provide some additional commentary on the continued concern around the low-income consumer that you cited in your remarks? Do you see any improvement on the horizon? And do you think you\u2019re seeing any signs of a trade-down customer in your stores?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. We\u2019ve said this before, but it bears repeating. The lower-income shopper is a core customer for us. And historically, has been a major driver of our growth. That low-income customer likes and needs the value that we offer. Now over the last couple of years, low-income consumer has really been on a roller coaster in 2021. The federal stimulus program drove a surge in their spending. And then last year, they crashed back down to earth as food prices, gas prices, and general inflation swallowed up from their disposable income. So since early 2022, the economic pressure on that customer has clearly been a major headwind for us. And your question was, do we see any improvement on the horizon? And actually, we do, unless there is a major economic shock like the federal government shutting down or defaulting on its debt. We think there are a couple of factors that could ease the pressure on the lower-income customer over the next several months. Let me start with what just happened in Q1. One of the major headwinds that we faced in Q1 was lower tax refunds, which, as I described in the remarks, tend to have a huge impact on lower-income shoppers. Now that impact should abate as we move out of tax refund season. And it\u2019s true. There are some headwinds like reduced snap benefits that are going to persist. So compared with lower tax refunds, the dollar impact of these is fairly small. The other factor that could help is that over the next few months, we\u2019re going to be anniversarying the high gas prices of last summer. I mentioned this in the prepared remarks. The lower-income customer is very sensitive to higher gas prices. Those costs tend to represent a higher proportion of their household spending. Gas prices are now significantly lower than they were last summer and again, unless some major event drives them back up, and it seems likely that, that could become a positive tailwind this year. Now let me move on to the other part of your question, which is about the trade-down customer. And I want to be careful not to overstate this, but yes, I do think that we\u2019re seeing some, let\u2019s call it, early evidence of a trade-down customer in our stores. And there are two pieces of data that I would offer up to support that. Firstly, when we look at our stores based upon the income profile of the trade area that they are in, we\u2019re seeing that stores in areas with higher household incomes are outperforming the rest of our chain. And by the way, it\u2019s worth noting that, that is the complete reverse of the historical pattern that we\u2019ve seen over many years. Historically, our growth and performance has been driven by stores that are located with low to moderate income households. And we believe that, that reversal just reflects the stage of the economic cycle that we\u2019re in. And it suggests that we may be starting to see a trade down shopper. Secondly, when you look inside our assortment, as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re seeing strength at our opening price points. Clearly, for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked about, the need of the customer appreciates those values. But we\u2019re also seeing strength at higher price points, especially on great branded merchandise. It\u2019s the middle price points that are the softest. Again, we think that the strength that we\u2019re seeing at higher price points may be early evidence of more want to deal or trade down shoppers coming into our stores. So I guess I\u2019d sum up, this is a long answer, but I\u2019d sum it up by saying, we recognize that there are risks and uncertainties. The consumer is under huge economic pressure. But we also see some grounds for optimism. We believe that some of the big headwinds that have affected lower income customer will abate and others may even turn around in the coming months, turn into tailwinds. And separately, we think there may be some early evidence that we\u2019re seeing a trade down shopper in our stores.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then, Kristin, to follow-up on your second quarter operating margin. So the comp guide makes sense based on the rationale that you cited, but the margin expansion is lower than expected. Are there any drivers of this to explain? And on the back half margins now implied to be up more than the front half. What are the drivers and just your confidence in achieving this plan?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. So for the second quarter, we\u2019re guiding a plus 2% to plus 4% comp growth and modeling 10 to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. The operating margin leverage really comes from two main sources: higher merchandise margin and lower freight. We do expect to continue to benefit in the second quarter from lower freight, particularly lower ocean freight costs versus last year. And our merchandise margin should be more favorable in the second quarter, but of course, this will depend on sales in the quarter. There are some headwinds built into the second quarter margin guidance. These include some transitory expenses and timing of certain expenses. These are collectively worth about 50 basis points and includes lapping one-time gains in Q2 of last year from real estate sales and insurance settlements and some timing of marketing expenses. In addition, we also have potentially higher supply chain costs given the increased mix of true closeout merchandise as well as the lower AURs as we\u2019ve expanded opening price points. Those are really the key puts and takes on the second quarter margin. For the back half of fiscal \u201823, our guidance assumes comp store sales of plus 3% to plus 6% and adjusted EBIT margins to increase 100 to 150 basis points. This is higher than the first half, as you\u2019ve noted in your question. Like Q2, we expect leverage in the fall from higher gross margin both from higher merchandise margin and lower freight costs. And in addition, I noted the transitory expenses we\u2019re facing in Q2 that we do not expect to have in the fall. And depending on the sales comp, we should leverage on fixed expenses like occupancy in the fall. So in light of these factors, overall, we feel good about the second half guidance.\nMatthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, you mentioned that the weakness in the sales trend across retail in the first quarter may lead to more promotional activity in the second quarter. Can you elaborate on this a little and whether you believe this could hurt your sales in the second quarter?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. We think \u2013 actually, we realized that the slowdown in traffic and in the trend that we saw in March was most likely also experienced by other discretionary retailers. I think that\u2019s coming through in some of the numbers that are being reported. We anticipate as we get further into the spring season, the sales softness is likely to lead to some increased promotional activity versus where we are now. Retailers will want to clear their spring merchandise and make way for four receipts. Now just kind of clearance process, we regard as natural and similar to what we would have expected and experienced pre-pandemic, those promotions are a headwind for us, of course, but they are really just part of the normal course of business, and we should be able to compete just fine in that higher promotional environment. We think we\u2019ve adequately reflected any headwind from this in our Q2 guidance. But let me contrast that or this situation with last year. Last year, the imbalance between supply and demand was much more significant. There were many large retailers that were backed up with inventory that they had to clear. And this all came together at a time when we at Burlington, we\u2019re raising retail prices. So fast forward to this year, yes, we\u2019re expecting some external promotional activity, but we think most retailers are in much better shape, much cleaner shape than they were last year. And this should mean promotions are lower and less widespread. And secondly, we at Burlington are in a much better position in terms of our own values. As I\u2019ve described, over the last few quarters, we worked hard to sharpen our values. This is something we\u2019ve been very focused on. And at this point, we feel like we\u2019re very well positioned. So to sum this all up, yes, we expect promotions to pick up in Q2, but we anticipate that the impact on our sales trend should be limited, and we believe that we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve adequately factored that into our Q2 guidance.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. My second question is about your new store opening plans. Last quarter, you talked about a goal of 70 to 80 new stores this year. Is there any update to this, especially in light of some of the retail bankruptcies that have been announced, do you think these will have an impact on the availability of real estate?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Again, thank you for the question. In our fourth quarter call in March, we described that we expect to open 90 to 100 new stores this year. That\u2019s a gross number. Once you pull out relocations and closures, you get to the number, of 70 to 80 net new stores in 2023. But the short answer is that our plan for this number of openings has not changed. Now on your point about retail bankruptcies, yes, we think these bankruptcies are likely to have a significant impact on the availability of attractive new store locations. The bankruptcy process typically is complicated and can take out a long time. So it\u2019s hard to get specific. But we\u2019re confident that these bankruptcies will strengthen our new store pipeline. We have an ambitious program for the expansion of our store network and the relocation of some of our older, more tired and less productive stores. So I think this new store pipeline, the stronger new store pipeline is really going to help us to execute on this program over the next several years. The final point to make is that we have a very strong real estate team that has a lot of experience dealing with retail bankruptcies. Many of our most successful and productive stores today will once upon a time, Circuit City, Toys \"R\" Us, Sports Authority, Linens \u2018n Things. Some of our best stores were created from carved up, Kmart or Sears locations. My point is that we have a team with a lot of experience in assessing the suitability and evaluating the potential economics of locations that emerge from these types of bankruptcies and then negotiating for or going after those.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Lorraine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nIke Boruchow: Hi, good morning. Hi, Kristin, David. I guess, first question, really just big picture on merchandise availability. Clearly, off-price merchandise. It\u2019s been pretty strong for the last couple of quarters. I guess, Michael, do you have any concerns? Are you seeing any signs that this may be tightening in any way? And then I do have a follow-up for Kristin.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Ike. The headline is that the availability of off-price merchandise remains exceptionally strong. Our merchants have been making some great buys. And we really haven\u2019t seen any real tightening of supply. When I contrast this to the back half of last year, I would say that the \u2013 I was also very good. I would say that the main difference is the drivers of availability may have changed. Last year, the retail industry was a wash with inventory, mainly because vendors and retailers had just ordered too much. When they originally placed those orders back in late 2021, they were facing huge supply chain delays and constraints. So they have built a volume and a time cushion into those orders, then of course, as the supply chain constraints unraveled, everything showed up all at once. So there was far too much supply in the back half of 2022. This year, this spring, we\u2019re still seeing plenty of off-price availability. In other words, we\u2019re seeing a similar outcome. But this time, I think it\u2019s different. I think it still being driven by too much supply, it\u2019s been driven by too little demand. The customers pulling back, sales trends have softened. And because of this, we\u2019re still seeing great merchandise coming into the off-price channel. Now whatever the root cause, in this environment, the key thing for us is to manage and control the buying process. So we get the very, very best deals. We\u2019re not really worried about availability right now. We\u2019re focused on control. Our buyers know that are open to buy our liquidity. It is an extremely valuable currency in this environment, and we need to make absolutely sure that every hanger on the rack deserves to be there.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. And then a follow-up to Kristin, just on the comp characteristics, could you kind of dig into the components of comp growth, traffic conversion, transaction size and especially I would love some color in particular on average ticket price, what you saw in Q1 and maybe expectations for Q2? Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. In the first quarter, traffic was up modestly. It started strong but then meaningfully decelerated in mid-March. Typically, lower traffic is not driven by anything happening within the stores. It\u2019s driven by external macro factors. And this drop-off in traffic really supports our hypothesis that external factors were the primary driver of the weakening comp trend in mid-March. The biggest drivers of the first quarter comp were higher conversion and higher units per transaction. Again, this data supports our belief that our strong values are resonating with the consumer. Once she comes into the store, she is more likely to buy and she\u2019s buying more. For the quarter, AUR was down modestly. This lower AUR reflects our strategy of expanding our opening price points. We expect our AUR to be down somewhat throughout the year as we focus on start values, and this lower AUR does pressure our supply chain expenses, as I mentioned, and we\u2019ve built this into our guidance.\nIke Boruchow: Great. Thanks so much.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open please go ahead.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: John are you there? Operator, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlex Straton: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. My first one is really for Michael on the assortment strategies and the buying organization. Definitely it sounds like you\u2019re happier with the level of execution than maybe you were last year. Could you just provide some additional color on maybe what has changed and also updates on some of the investments you\u2019re making in the buying organization? I do have a follow-up for Kristin, after that.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Alex. Thanks for the question. In the back half of last year, we spent a lot of time tearing apart the drivers of our performance and redirecting and refocusing our assortment strategies to deliver much stronger and sharper value to the customer. I feel very, very good about the progress that we\u2019ve made since then. If I look at the time frame between October and mid-March, the improvement in our sales trend was quite significant. On previous calls, we\u2019ve shared details on some of the strategies that we\u2019ve been pursuing. So just to call these out at a high level, we\u2019ve seen a significant expansion of our opening price points really focused on the \u2013 the need customer. Secondly, a focus on recognizable brands to go after sort of the once a deal or trade that customer. Thirdly, a more aggressive approach to shifting liquidity to stronger trending businesses. And then lastly, a much more ruthless approach to pulling back on a weaker training businesses. So overall, I feel like we\u2019ve executed well against those strategies. Now we need to stay focused, very focused, and we will. The other point to make is that although we are pleased with the overall execution, there is always opportunities for improvement. That\u2019s the nature of the business we\u2019re in. There will always be some areas where we make mistakes or we make a buy that we shouldn\u2019t have made or we price a buy at a level that\u2019s too high. Now at Burlington, I think that culturally, we\u2019re very, very good at recognizing investing up to our mistakes and then correcting and learning from them. And I think that\u2019s very important. But let me take a step back and address your question about investments we\u2019ve made in our buying and planning organization. In the last few years, we\u2019ve significantly grown this organization. Our merchandising headcount is about 50% bigger than it was in 2019. We\u2019ve brought in tremendous talent at all levels, and we\u2019ve promoted great talent from within. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in parallel with that headcount growth, we\u2019ve been investing in and developing new tools, systems and processes to support and leverage this merchandising talent. Now all of that program support Merchandising 2.0. Historically, the tools, processes and systems that have supported the merchants at Burlington have been very rigid, somewhat department store like, I would say, especially with regard to the visibility to data and responsiveness to in-season trends. Merchandising 2.0 is really designed to transform our buying and planning capabilities, to enable greater flexibility to respond to trends and to provide clearer visibility to up-to-date and actionable business intelligence. This year, we are rolling out many of those new capabilities to the buying and planning organization. We are very excited. And as I have said in the remarks, the merchants are extremely excited about the impact that those capabilities are going to have in terms of driving improved performance and execution over the next few years. So, the main message to take away from my answer is that, yes, we are pleased with how our merchant \u2013 merchandising organization has performed over the last couple of quarters, but we still think we have a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nAlex Straton: That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much. Maybe one more for Kristin on inventory and specifically reserve. I think you said that it was about 44% of inventory at the end of the quarter, and I think that compares to 50% or so last year. Should we be at all concerned about reserve inventory being below last year, or how should we think about that in general? Thanks a lot.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning Alex. It\u2019s a good question. So, let me offer a few points to contextualize the inventory data. First, we have more inventory in our stores than we had last year as we were under inventory last year. However, if you compare to 2019, our first quarter comp store inventories are actually down about 10%. So, we are still running leaner and turning faster versus our 2019 baseline. Secondly, reserve is made up of great buys that we are holding until the season or the next season. We buy reserve opportunistically. So, the level of reserve we carry at any time will typically fluctuate depending on the supply. But there is a factor here that\u2019s important to note. Last year, given some of the receipt delays that we had experienced, we brought some goods in earlier than we normally would have. Now, that these receipt delays are behind us, this is freeing up some of the reserve capacity and putting a little downward pressure on reserve levels. So, the implication is that assuming we continue to see great buying opportunities this year, the level of our reserve might trend down slightly relative to last year. And at the end of Q1, our reserve levels were about 11% lower than last year, and this is really more of a reflection of the point I just made, rather than a reflection of the merchandise supply or the buying environment. And lastly, finishing up on reserve, it\u2019s important to reiterate that our reserve levels are still about 65% higher than they were pre-pandemic. This really represents a strategic and structural shift in our business as we are more focused on great off-price opportunistic buys.\nAlex Straton: Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kernan: Alright. Good morning. Michael, Kristin, and David, I have a couple of questions for Kristin. Firstly, on the merch margin in Q1. Just given the sales slowdown and more focus on lower AURs, I suppose I am a little surprised that merch margin was only down 20 basis points. Are there any other drivers you can share in terms of the merch margin performance?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning John. Thanks for the questions. Overall, our merchandise margin was below last year and our internal plan and this was really driven by the higher markdowns due to the change in the sales trend that we saw during the quarter, as we described in the prepared remarks. But you will also recall our markdowns were artificially low because our stores were under inventoried early in the quarter last year in 2022. And while our markdown levels this year were higher than last year, it\u2019s worth noting that our markdown levels are well below 2019 and our inventory is still turning much faster relative to 2019. And while I don\u2019t want to get too specific on the merch margin breakdown, I do want to share that due to the strong buying environment, we did see higher year-over-year markup while still passing along strong values to our customers. So, we feel good about our inventory position exiting the quarter. We think it\u2019s seasonally appropriate, and we are well positioned to deliver great value.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Maybe shifting to freight, I think 150 basis points of favorability. Is there any other color you can add on this? How should we think about freight margin recapture in the rest of the year, both on gross margin and SG&A?\nKristin Wolfe: Great. So, as you know, external freight rates are moderating, particularly ocean freight. This is the primary driver of the Q1 freight favorability, which was 150 basis points lower than last year, as you noted. And to put this in perspective, in Q1 of \u201822, freight expenses were about 270 basis points higher than Q1 of 2019. But in the first quarter of \u201823, we have recaptured more than half of this deleverage. The Q1 \u201823 freight costs are about 120 basis points higher than 2019. Our teams have worked really hard to renegotiate our freight contracts and take advantage of a softening freight market for both ocean and domestic freight. And so for the balance of the year, we expect continued leverage due to improved ocean freight rates along with much fewer surcharges, that\u2019s primarily benefiting the first half of the year, while improved domestic rates will drive lower freight costs in the back half of the year. In addition, we are working to optimize our outbound and inbound transportation processes and are actively focused on several initiatives that drive transportation efficiency. And finally, through our contracting process this spring, freight rates came in modestly better than we had forecasted, and this is built into our guidance.\nJohn Kernan: Alright. Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nChuck Grom: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for all the color this morning. Michael, I was wondering if you can give us an update on some other aspects of Burlington 2.0, you touched on merchandising in your prepared remarks. I wonder if you could give us some updates on real estate and supply chain fronts.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. So, good morning, Chuck. Yes, let me provide some sort of some headlines in terms of the progress we have been making with Burlington 2.0 initiatives. I will break it into stores, real estate and supply chain. So, in terms of stores or store operations, we have done a lot of things over the last few years to make our stores more flexible. It\u2019s very important in the off-price model to be able to chase sales at a top line level, but also within the assortment, footwear is doing well to expand footwear, if home is doing well to expand home, etcetera. And also to pull back in certain areas based upon trends. We have also had a lot of focus on getting receipts out to the floor. Let\u2019s make sure we get the receipts out in a rapid way as possible. And we have introduced multiple new processes to make our stores more efficient. And that\u2019s all been during a time over the last couple of years where the labor market has been very tough. So, we have had to sort of make all those changes while facing headwinds in terms of labor availability. We have also been developing a number of improved tools and systems to help drive efficiency and consistency in stores. Now, some of those systems improvements, which are going to be very important to us, obviously, have a slightly longer lead time. And I think the most important of those systems upgrades, we are probably going to be piloting in the back half of this year, but probably won\u2019t roll out till next year. So, we have made a lot of progress. We have done a lot of things. I am very happy with what we have been able to do in stores. Then we move on to real estate, so new stores. We have ramped up our new store opening program with a focus on our new smaller store prototype. We are very happy with the relative economics of that prototype and that\u2019s allowed us to ramp up the number of new stores over the last couple of years. And as I have said in my remarks, this year, we expect to open 70 to 80 net new stores. Now, we would like to open more, and we hope in 2024 and 2025, some of the availability that we are seeing from bankruptcies from retail bankruptcies will give us the opportunity to open more. But we will have to see and obviously, we will provide more updates on that as we get closer to the end of the year. Let me finish up with supply chain. There are a number of things that we have been working on in supply chain to increase our flexibility and efficiency. Now again, we have been working on those things in an environment where the labor market, especially in areas that have large warehouses and distribution centers has been tough. And also frankly, receipt volatility has made efficiency tough. But there are a number of actions that we have been taking, some of which we have been able to execute in the short-term, for example, making adjustments to shift schedules or work processes, etcetera. But there are others that have a longer lead time, things like systems changes and automation. So, again, happy with the progress we have made, but I feel like there is a lot more we can do and our supply chain teams are very focused on those opportunities. So, let me sort of take a step back and sort of sum up with an overall assessment. But when I look across the organization, I am very happy with the progress that we have made on our Burlington 2.0 initiatives, especially given the external environment in the last couple of years. I feel like we have moved fast. And because of that, I can see we have made some mistakes. But the changes that we have made are going to make us a much more effective off-price retailer, and they are really going to drive that success in the next few years.\nChuck Grom: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up is for Kristin. Could you talk about your degree of confidence in your back half guide, particularly after missing some of the numbers here in the first quarter? And then can you help us out on the sequencing of both comps and margins? I think you said up over 100 basis points, 150 basis points on EBIT, but just a sequencing of comps and margins in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: You know what, Chuck, let me \u2013 let\u2019s break that question into two. Why don\u2019t I start \u2013 I will start with the sales confidence. And then maybe Kristin can address the margin and expense outlook. So, on sales, we \u2013 well, first of all, we have recognized we can see that the environment this year is very uncertain. There are lots of things that could happen, recession, banking crisis, government shutdowns, etcetera. But given what we know at this point, I think there are a few things that sort of give us confidence in our back half guidance. We \u2013 I would say there were really three things in particular that allowed us to sort of triangulate on our full year guidance. Number one, our comp in Q1, even though we were disappointed with that comp, we just reported a 4%. Now, our full year guidance is 3% to 5%. For the reasons I described in the remarks, we think that, that 4% was partly driven by transitory headwinds. If you just strip out the tax refund impact, we think it would have been 5%. So again, just based upon the first quarter trend, we feel like we are moving in the right direction to hit our full year comp guidance of 3% to 5%. Second thing to triangulate on that 3% to 5% was when we look ahead here, we feel like we are up against some things from last year. We are anniversarying some negative things from last year. In particular, the very, very high promotional activity in mass retail that happened really from mid-Q2 onwards throughout the summer and into the fall, the mass retailers now are in much better shape in terms of control of their inventories. So, we are not expecting the same level of promotional activity, and we think that will help us. The other thing that we are anniversarying, I mentioned in the remarks, is higher gas prices. That last summer, gas prices were much higher than they are now. So, as we move over the next few months, as long as gas prices stay where they are, we think that will be a tailwind. And then the third thing that we use to triangulate on that 3% to 5% for the full year guidance was that we are up against our own mistakes from last year. And in particular, the decision we made to raise retails in the sort of second quarter and third quarter of last year. As we described, especially on our third quarter and fourth quarter call, we feel like that really hurts us. We are in much better shape now, much, much stronger focus on value. So again, I will go back to what I said at the beginning of my answer, there is plenty of uncertainty out there. But we think \u2013 we feel pretty good about our full year guidance of the 3% to 5% comp. But let me pass it over to Kristin, just to comment on the margin aspects of that.\nKristin Wolfe: Sure. So, for the back half of fiscal \u201823 for the fall, as you noted, we \u2013 EBIT margins are planned to increase 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And similar to the first half of the year, we do expect higher gross margins, both higher merchandise margins and \u2013 but also lower freight costs. Lower freight costs, particularly on the domestic side in the back half of the year. In addition, the transitory expenses that we \u2013 that hurt us in Q2, we obviously don\u2019t have in the fall. And given the sales comp, we are planning for the fall, we should leverage on fixed expenses like occupancy. So, those are the big puts and takes for the fall on the margins side.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. Helpful color. Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks Chuck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please go ahead.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Thank you. Curious how you would assess your performance this quarter relative to the other major off-price retailers? Thanks. And then I have a quick follow-up.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Sure. Well, thank you, Mark. A good question, I think let me start by saying that we feel like we are lucky in our business. We have two very successful analogs, companies that have been in the off-price business for a long time. Companies, if you like, that demonstrate what\u2019s possible, what full potential looks like. Now of course, there are differences between each of us, especially when it comes to the demographics of our core customers. Our core customer tends to skew lower-income, younger, higher ethnicity, larger family size, more urban, we love this customer. They have been a major driver of our growth over many years, and they will be again. But over the past year, that customer, in particular, has been under severe economic pressure. The other major difference between us and the other larger off-price retailers is that, I would say, we are newer to the off-price business. And we are less mature, if you like. Our peers have been executing and refining the off-price model for decades. We haven\u2019t \u2013 compared to them, we are a relative latecomer to the off-price business. And that lack of maturity shows up in our systems processes and sometimes in our execution. But look, that\u2019s why I am here. That\u2019s why the whole executive team is here. That\u2019s why Burlington is an exciting place to be, exciting place to invest. We are the smallest, least productive and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. We believe but the off-price retail channel will continue to take share over the next several years. And as that happens, we at Burlington feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth in our sales and profitability. So yes, the last year has had its challenges for sure, but we think the longer term outlook is very, very exciting.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you. And attraction of younger shoppers has been a theme among some of your competitors. Can you frame up the opportunity you have there and with perhaps other demographics to broaden Burlington\u2019s reach?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Yes. I think it\u2019s a very good question. Let me start on the younger shoppers. We have always had a stronger share of younger customers compared to department stores, but also compared to our off-price peers. Our \u2013 when you walk into our stores, you can physically see the customer base and the assortment \u2013 younger. We have a stronger penetration of kids \u2013 of the kids business, juniors, young men\u2019s and our shoppers aren\u2019t just younger. They tend to be \u2013 obviously, we have talked this morning about the fact that they tend to be lower income. They tend to be more ethnic, they tend to be more urban. Those are the demographic segments, not only are they a core strength for Burlington, that they are, over the long-term growing segments in the United States. And as I have said earlier, given where we are in the economic cycle, those consumers are struggling right now. But over the long-term, that\u2019s an attractive set of demographics to have strengthen. Let me expand to the second part of your question. Are there other \u2013 can we expand and broaden our demographics, we \u2013 in order to get to our 2,000 stores, which is the long-term goal for Burlington, we need to be able to operate in a range of different store locations and attract a wide range of demographics, even though the core group that I just described are younger, more ethnic, urban etcetera, even though that\u2019s a large segment of the population, we still need to be able to operate effectively in other areas. So, there are a number of things that we are doing in our business to sort of improve \u2013 what I would say is the customization of our assortment by store and therefore, to appeal to a broader demographic not only need to do a customer, but wanted to do a customer. So, I feel pretty good about our ability to do that over time. But it\u2019s definitely something that we were aware that we need to work on over the next several years.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Michael O\u2019Sullivan for closing remarks.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael and good morning everyone. I will start with some additional financial details on Q1. Total sales in the quarter were up 11%, while comparable store sales were up 4%. We are disappointed with this outcome. We had planned and guided to stronger comp growth. But as Michael said, we believe that our weaker comp in Q1 was driven by external headwinds, lower tax refunds and cooler weather. If we are right, then these headwinds are temporary and they should abate as we move into the second quarter. The gross margin rate in Q1 was 42.3%, an increase of 130 basis points versus 2022's first quarter rate of 41%. This was driven by a 150 basis point decrease in freight expense which more than offset a 20 basis point decrease in merchandise margins. This lower merchandise margin was driven by higher markdowns, which in turn were driven by the sudden slowdown in the trend that we saw during the quarter. Product sourcing costs were $187 million versus $157 million in the first quarter of 2022, increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales, higher buying and asset protection costs represented the majority of this deleverage. Adjusted SG&A was $565 million versus $514 million in 2022, decreasing 20 basis points as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by lower store-related costs. Adjusted EBIT margin was 4.1%, 100 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBIT margin was below the low end of our guidance, primarily due to the lower sales versus our guidance. To sum up, the lower-than-planned sales drove higher markdowns and lower SG&A leverage. And this led to the lower-than-planned expansion of our operating margin in Q1. All of this resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.50 versus $0.24 in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.84 versus $0.54 in the first quarter of 2022. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories increased by approximately 10% on a comp store basis. This is slightly higher than we had planned, again, driven by lower comp sales and plans. As a point of reference, at the end of May, our in-store inventories are now flat to last year on a comp store basis. At the end of Q1, reserve inventory represented 44% of our inventory versus 50% last year. As a reminder, our reserve inventory is still significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels, up about 65% since 2019. This reflects the fact that compared with our history, we are making much greater use of reserve to chase off-price buying opportunities and hold for later release. During the quarter, we opened 6 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the first quarter to 933 stores. This included 13 new store openings and 7 relocations or closures. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year 2023 and for the second quarter. We are reiterating our full year sales and earnings guidance, which includes a comp sales outlook of up 3% to up 5%. Based on this comp sales outlook, we still expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 80 to 120 basis points. This sales and margin outlook translates to an adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $6. This is consistent with the outlook we provided on our Q4 call in March. As a reminder, this includes $0.05 of EPS from the 53rd week. In the second quarter, for the reasons Michael detailed earlier, we are planning and guiding to a comp increase of plus 2% to plus 4%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 10 to up 50 basis points versus Q2 of 2022. This translates to EPS guidance for the second quarter of $0.35 to $0.45. For the back half of fiscal 2023, this outlook assumes comp store sales of plus 3% to plus 6%. EBIT margins to increase 100 to 150 basis points and EPS in the range of $4.31 to $4.71, an increase of 27% to 39% compared to last year. I will now turn the call back over to Michael. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. So for the second quarter, we're guiding a plus 2% to plus 4% comp growth and modeling 10 to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. The operating margin leverage really comes from two main sources: higher merchandise margin and lower freight. We do expect to continue to benefit in the second quarter from lower freight, particularly lower ocean freight costs versus last year. And our merchandise margin should be more favorable in the second quarter, but of course, this will depend on sales in the quarter. There are some headwinds built into the second quarter margin guidance. These include some transitory expenses and timing of certain expenses. These are collectively worth about 50 basis points and includes lapping one-time gains in Q2 of last year from real estate sales and insurance settlements and some timing of marketing expenses. In addition, we also have potentially higher supply chain costs given the increased mix of true closeout merchandise as well as the lower AURs as we've expanded opening price points. Those are really the key puts and takes on the second quarter margin. For the back half of fiscal \u201823, our guidance assumes comp store sales of plus 3% to plus 6% and adjusted EBIT margins to increase 100 to 150 basis points. This is higher than the first half, as you've noted in your question. Like Q2, we expect leverage in the fall from higher gross margin both from higher merchandise margin and lower freight costs. And in addition, I noted the transitory expenses we're facing in Q2 that we do not expect to have in the fall. And depending on the sales comp, we should leverage on fixed expenses like occupancy in the fall. So in light of these factors, overall, we feel good about the second half guidance. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. In the first quarter, traffic was up modestly. It started strong but then meaningfully decelerated in mid-March. Typically, lower traffic is not driven by anything happening within the stores. It's driven by external macro factors. And this drop-off in traffic really supports our hypothesis that external factors were the primary driver of the weakening comp trend in mid-March. The biggest drivers of the first quarter comp were higher conversion and higher units per transaction. Again, this data supports our belief that our strong values are resonating with the consumer. Once she comes into the store, she is more likely to buy and she's buying more. For the quarter, AUR was down modestly. This lower AUR reflects our strategy of expanding our opening price points. We expect our AUR to be down somewhat throughout the year as we focus on start values, and this lower AUR does pressure our supply chain expenses, as I mentioned, and we've built this into our guidance. Good morning Alex. It's a good question. So, let me offer a few points to contextualize the inventory data. First, we have more inventory in our stores than we had last year as we were under inventory last year. However, if you compare to 2019, our first quarter comp store inventories are actually down about 10%. So, we are still running leaner and turning faster versus our 2019 baseline. Secondly, reserve is made up of great buys that we are holding until the season or the next season. We buy reserve opportunistically. So, the level of reserve we carry at any time will typically fluctuate depending on the supply. But there is a factor here that's important to note. Last year, given some of the receipt delays that we had experienced, we brought some goods in earlier than we normally would have. Now, that these receipt delays are behind us, this is freeing up some of the reserve capacity and putting a little downward pressure on reserve levels. So, the implication is that assuming we continue to see great buying opportunities this year, the level of our reserve might trend down slightly relative to last year. And at the end of Q1, our reserve levels were about 11% lower than last year, and this is really more of a reflection of the point I just made, rather than a reflection of the merchandise supply or the buying environment. And lastly, finishing up on reserve, it's important to reiterate that our reserve levels are still about 65% higher than they were pre-pandemic. This really represents a strategic and structural shift in our business as we are more focused on great off-price opportunistic buys. Thanks Alex. Good morning John. Thanks for the questions. Overall, our merchandise margin was below last year and our internal plan and this was really driven by the higher markdowns due to the change in the sales trend that we saw during the quarter, as we described in the prepared remarks. But you will also recall our markdowns were artificially low because our stores were under inventoried early in the quarter last year in 2022. And while our markdown levels this year were higher than last year, it's worth noting that our markdown levels are well below 2019 and our inventory is still turning much faster relative to 2019. And while I don't want to get too specific on the merch margin breakdown, I do want to share that due to the strong buying environment, we did see higher year-over-year markup while still passing along strong values to our customers. So, we feel good about our inventory position exiting the quarter. We think it's seasonally appropriate, and we are well positioned to deliver great value. Great. So, as you know, external freight rates are moderating, particularly ocean freight. This is the primary driver of the Q1 freight favorability, which was 150 basis points lower than last year, as you noted. And to put this in perspective, in Q1 of \u201822, freight expenses were about 270 basis points higher than Q1 of 2019. But in the first quarter of \u201823, we have recaptured more than half of this deleverage. The Q1 \u201823 freight costs are about 120 basis points higher than 2019. Our teams have worked really hard to renegotiate our freight contracts and take advantage of a softening freight market for both ocean and domestic freight. And so for the balance of the year, we expect continued leverage due to improved ocean freight rates along with much fewer surcharges, that's primarily benefiting the first half of the year, while improved domestic rates will drive lower freight costs in the back half of the year. In addition, we are working to optimize our outbound and inbound transportation processes and are actively focused on several initiatives that drive transportation efficiency. And finally, through our contracting process this spring, freight rates came in modestly better than we had forecasted, and this is built into our guidance. Thanks John. Sure. So, for the back half of fiscal \u201823 for the fall, as you noted, we \u2013 EBIT margins are planned to increase 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And similar to the first half of the year, we do expect higher gross margins, both higher merchandise margins and \u2013 but also lower freight costs. Lower freight costs, particularly on the domestic side in the back half of the year. In addition, the transitory expenses that we \u2013 that hurt us in Q2, we obviously don't have in the fall. And given the sales comp, we are planning for the fall, we should leverage on fixed expenses like occupancy. So, those are the big puts and takes for the fall on the margins side."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our first quarter results. Secondly, I will talk about our guidance for the second quarter. And finally, I will comment on the full year outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our first quarter results and our 2023 guidance. Then, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let's talk about our Q1 results. Comp store sales for the first quarter increased 4% versus our guidance of 5% to 7%. On a geometric stack basis, this represents 3% comp store sales growth versus 2019. As I will explain in a moment, we believe that this weaker-than-planned comp growth was driven by two external factors. We started the quarter very strongly. In fact, until mid-March, our comp growth was running up double-digits. As we have described on the last couple of calls, we have had a very strong focus on delivering great value in our assortment, expanding opening price points and offering great brands of well values. This strategy has driven the improvement in the sales trend that we have seen since early Q4 and this strong momentum continued well into the first quarter. Our merchants and operators have done a nice job executing this value strategy. The slowdown in our sales trend that we saw in the first quarter coincided with two external factors. Firstly, the timing of tax refunds. These had run ahead of last year, early in the quarter, but in March, they began to fall off. Refunds ended the quarter well behind last year's levels and also below 2019 levels. The reason this is important is that tax refunds are the main delivery vehicle for important federal benefits programs like the earned income tax credit and tile tax credit. So, lower income customers are hugely sensitive to lower tax refunds. This is what happened in Q1. Based on our own historic experience, we estimate that lower tax refunds cost us about 1 point of comp growth in the quarter. I think you have probably heard very similar commentary from other retailers that serve lower income shoppers. The second thing that happened or didn't happen was weather. In the important weeks leading up to Easter, temperatures across the country were cooler than last year. Our warm weather businesses, which were doing well early in the quarter, softened versus the rest of the store in mid-March. So to summarize, we believe that the compound effect of lower tax refunds and cooler weather leading up to Easter was the primary driver of the sharp falloff in our trend in mid-March. Okay. Let me move on and talk about the more recent trend. On a geometric stack basis, we began to see a pickup in the second half of April and this momentum has continued May, month-to-date. This recent pickup reinforces our belief that the slowdown that we saw in mid-March was driven by external transitory factors. We are guiding and managing our business to a comp growth range of 2% to 4% for the second quarter. If the momentum that we have seen since mid-April is sustained, then this guidance may turn out to be conservative. And if this current trend remains strong and our merchants and operators are ready and able to chase it. There is plenty of merchandise supply to support this chase. Overall, as we look ahead to Q2, we feel good. We believe that our strong focus on value and our strategies to support this are working. We need to stay very focused on these strategies and we will. As I have described, we believe that the slowdown in the trend that we saw in Q1 is explainable and attributable to ex-transitory factors, factors that should now be behind us. With that said, we recognize that this is a very uncertain environment and we remain very concerned about the economic health of the lower income customer. So, it makes sense to manage our business cautiously and be ready to chase a stronger trend. Let me move on to the rest of the year. As we communicated in March, our guidance for the full year is for 3% to 5% comp store sales growth. And based on this comp growth, we expect to drive 80 to 120 basis points of margin expansion. We are still comfortable with this guidance. We see plenty of risks and uncertainties, but we also see some potential tailwinds. Let me elaborate on three of these potential tailwinds. Number one, last year, our industry was upside down with inventory and this drove huge promotional activity, especially in mass retail. We think that the soft sales trends that many retailers have reported in Q1 are likely to drive higher promotional activity in Q2 but we still anticipate that this promotional activity will be below last year's levels. This year-over-year lower promotional activity should help our comp trend. Number two, last year, we made the mistake of taking up retail prices in Q2 and Q3, this backfired. Our core customer was and is under significant economic pressure and those higher retails hurt us, especially in the face of the promotional activity that I have just described. This year, our values are sharpened. And again, this should help our trend. And number three, last summer, there were some external headwinds, in particular, higher gas prices that hurt our customer and our trend. Gas prices are now much lower. And unless something happens to drive them back up and this should become a tailwind for us over the next few months. So based on these tailwinds, we feel very good about our full year guidance. The supply environment remains very strong and with our focus on value, we believe that we are well positioned. In our remarks this morning, we have deliberately focused on the drivers of Q1 performance and the near-term outlook for Q2 and the full year. We recognize that given all the economic uncertainty, investors are trying to understand how the year might unfold across retail. So appropriately, there is a strong level of interest in these near-term performance drivers. With that said, I would like to talk for a moment about our Burlington 2.0 initiatives. Over the last couple of years, even as we have been dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath, we at Burlington have been pursuing a comprehensive program to transform ourselves into a more flexible, nimble and efficient off-price business, with a much greater focus on delivering great value to our shoppers. We are not going to cover this in a lot of depth today, but let me say that I am very pleased with our progress. We have made a lot of changes and improvements in buying and planning stores, supply chain and real estate. In upcoming quarterly calls, I will have more to say about these initiatives, but the one callout for today is the work we have been doing in merchandising. Over the last few years, we have significantly grown this organization. We have brought in tremendous talent at all levels and we have also promoted great talent from within. In parallel, we have been investing in and developing new tools, systems and processes to support and leverage this merchandising talent. Internally, we refer to this program as Merchandising 2.0 and it is designed to transform our buying and planning capabilities, enabling greater flexibility to respond to trends and providing clearer visibility through up-to-date and actionable business data and intelligence. We have just begun rolling out many of these new capabilities to the organization. We are excited and the merchants are especially excited about the impact that these will have on our ability to drive improved and more consistent performance and execution over the next several years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, who will share more details on our first quarter financial results as well as our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Kristin? Thank you, Kristin. Before we open up the call to questions, I would like to summarize some key points from today's call. Firstly, we are disappointed with our Q1 results, especially given the strength that we saw early in the quarter. But we believe that the weakening of the trend that we experienced in March was driven by 2 external factors that are now behind us, specifically, lower tax refunds and cooler weather leading up to Easter. Secondly, we feel very good about our underlying strategies and our focus on delivering strong value to our customers, and we are encouraged by the recent trend that we have seen in our business. We are being cautious in how we are planning Q2, but we are ready to face if the sales trend turns out to be stronger than guidance. And lastly, we remain comfortable with our full year guidance. We see plenty of uncertainty, and we remain concerned about the economic health of the low-income customer, but we also see some potential tailwinds. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. We've said this before, but it bears repeating. The lower-income shopper is a core customer for us. And historically, has been a major driver of our growth. That low-income customer likes and needs the value that we offer. Now over the last couple of years, low-income consumer has really been on a roller coaster in 2021. The federal stimulus program drove a surge in their spending. And then last year, they crashed back down to earth as food prices, gas prices, and general inflation swallowed up from their disposable income. So since early 2022, the economic pressure on that customer has clearly been a major headwind for us. And your question was, do we see any improvement on the horizon? And actually, we do, unless there is a major economic shock like the federal government shutting down or defaulting on its debt. We think there are a couple of factors that could ease the pressure on the lower-income customer over the next several months. Let me start with what just happened in Q1. One of the major headwinds that we faced in Q1 was lower tax refunds, which, as I described in the remarks, tend to have a huge impact on lower-income shoppers. Now that impact should abate as we move out of tax refund season. And it's true. There are some headwinds like reduced snap benefits that are going to persist. So compared with lower tax refunds, the dollar impact of these is fairly small. The other factor that could help is that over the next few months, we're going to be anniversarying the high gas prices of last summer. I mentioned this in the prepared remarks. The lower-income customer is very sensitive to higher gas prices. Those costs tend to represent a higher proportion of their household spending. Gas prices are now significantly lower than they were last summer and again, unless some major event drives them back up, and it seems likely that, that could become a positive tailwind this year. Now let me move on to the other part of your question, which is about the trade-down customer. And I want to be careful not to overstate this, but yes, I do think that we're seeing some, let's call it, early evidence of a trade-down customer in our stores. And there are two pieces of data that I would offer up to support that. Firstly, when we look at our stores based upon the income profile of the trade area that they are in, we're seeing that stores in areas with higher household incomes are outperforming the rest of our chain. And by the way, it's worth noting that, that is the complete reverse of the historical pattern that we've seen over many years. Historically, our growth and performance has been driven by stores that are located with low to moderate income households. And we believe that, that reversal just reflects the stage of the economic cycle that we're in. And it suggests that we may be starting to see a trade down shopper. Secondly, when you look inside our assortment, as you'd expect, we're seeing strength at our opening price points. Clearly, for all the reasons we've talked about, the need of the customer appreciates those values. But we're also seeing strength at higher price points, especially on great branded merchandise. It's the middle price points that are the softest. Again, we think that the strength that we're seeing at higher price points may be early evidence of more want to deal or trade down shoppers coming into our stores. So I guess I'd sum up, this is a long answer, but I'd sum it up by saying, we recognize that there are risks and uncertainties. The consumer is under huge economic pressure. But we also see some grounds for optimism. We believe that some of the big headwinds that have affected lower income customer will abate and others may even turn around in the coming months, turn into tailwinds. And separately, we think there may be some early evidence that we're seeing a trade down shopper in our stores. Thanks, Matt. Good morning, Lorraine. Thanks for the question. We think \u2013 actually, we realized that the slowdown in traffic and in the trend that we saw in March was most likely also experienced by other discretionary retailers. I think that's coming through in some of the numbers that are being reported. We anticipate as we get further into the spring season, the sales softness is likely to lead to some increased promotional activity versus where we are now. Retailers will want to clear their spring merchandise and make way for four receipts. Now just kind of clearance process, we regard as natural and similar to what we would have expected and experienced pre-pandemic, those promotions are a headwind for us, of course, but they are really just part of the normal course of business, and we should be able to compete just fine in that higher promotional environment. We think we've adequately reflected any headwind from this in our Q2 guidance. But let me contrast that or this situation with last year. Last year, the imbalance between supply and demand was much more significant. There were many large retailers that were backed up with inventory that they had to clear. And this all came together at a time when we at Burlington, we're raising retail prices. So fast forward to this year, yes, we're expecting some external promotional activity, but we think most retailers are in much better shape, much cleaner shape than they were last year. And this should mean promotions are lower and less widespread. And secondly, we at Burlington are in a much better position in terms of our own values. As I've described, over the last few quarters, we worked hard to sharpen our values. This is something we've been very focused on. And at this point, we feel like we're very well positioned. So to sum this all up, yes, we expect promotions to pick up in Q2, but we anticipate that the impact on our sales trend should be limited, and we believe that we've \u2013 we've adequately factored that into our Q2 guidance. Again, thank you for the question. In our fourth quarter call in March, we described that we expect to open 90 to 100 new stores this year. That's a gross number. Once you pull out relocations and closures, you get to the number, of 70 to 80 net new stores in 2023. But the short answer is that our plan for this number of openings has not changed. Now on your point about retail bankruptcies, yes, we think these bankruptcies are likely to have a significant impact on the availability of attractive new store locations. The bankruptcy process typically is complicated and can take out a long time. So it's hard to get specific. But we're confident that these bankruptcies will strengthen our new store pipeline. We have an ambitious program for the expansion of our store network and the relocation of some of our older, more tired and less productive stores. So I think this new store pipeline, the stronger new store pipeline is really going to help us to execute on this program over the next several years. The final point to make is that we have a very strong real estate team that has a lot of experience dealing with retail bankruptcies. Many of our most successful and productive stores today will once upon a time, Circuit City, Toys \"R\" Us, Sports Authority, Linens \u2018n Things. Some of our best stores were created from carved up, Kmart or Sears locations. My point is that we have a team with a lot of experience in assessing the suitability and evaluating the potential economics of locations that emerge from these types of bankruptcies and then negotiating for or going after those. Thanks, Lorraine. Good morning, Ike. The headline is that the availability of off-price merchandise remains exceptionally strong. Our merchants have been making some great buys. And we really haven't seen any real tightening of supply. When I contrast this to the back half of last year, I would say that the \u2013 I was also very good. I would say that the main difference is the drivers of availability may have changed. Last year, the retail industry was a wash with inventory, mainly because vendors and retailers had just ordered too much. When they originally placed those orders back in late 2021, they were facing huge supply chain delays and constraints. So they have built a volume and a time cushion into those orders, then of course, as the supply chain constraints unraveled, everything showed up all at once. So there was far too much supply in the back half of 2022. This year, this spring, we're still seeing plenty of off-price availability. In other words, we're seeing a similar outcome. But this time, I think it's different. I think it still being driven by too much supply, it's been driven by too little demand. The customers pulling back, sales trends have softened. And because of this, we're still seeing great merchandise coming into the off-price channel. Now whatever the root cause, in this environment, the key thing for us is to manage and control the buying process. So we get the very, very best deals. We're not really worried about availability right now. We're focused on control. Our buyers know that are open to buy our liquidity. It is an extremely valuable currency in this environment, and we need to make absolutely sure that every hanger on the rack deserves to be there. Thanks, Ike. John are you there? Operator, let's go to the next question. Good morning, Alex. Thanks for the question. In the back half of last year, we spent a lot of time tearing apart the drivers of our performance and redirecting and refocusing our assortment strategies to deliver much stronger and sharper value to the customer. I feel very, very good about the progress that we've made since then. If I look at the time frame between October and mid-March, the improvement in our sales trend was quite significant. On previous calls, we've shared details on some of the strategies that we've been pursuing. So just to call these out at a high level, we've seen a significant expansion of our opening price points really focused on the \u2013 the need customer. Secondly, a focus on recognizable brands to go after sort of the once a deal or trade that customer. Thirdly, a more aggressive approach to shifting liquidity to stronger trending businesses. And then lastly, a much more ruthless approach to pulling back on a weaker training businesses. So overall, I feel like we've executed well against those strategies. Now we need to stay focused, very focused, and we will. The other point to make is that although we are pleased with the overall execution, there is always opportunities for improvement. That's the nature of the business we're in. There will always be some areas where we make mistakes or we make a buy that we shouldn't have made or we price a buy at a level that's too high. Now at Burlington, I think that culturally, we're very, very good at recognizing investing up to our mistakes and then correcting and learning from them. And I think that's very important. But let me take a step back and address your question about investments we've made in our buying and planning organization. In the last few years, we've significantly grown this organization. Our merchandising headcount is about 50% bigger than it was in 2019. We've brought in tremendous talent at all levels, and we've promoted great talent from within. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in parallel with that headcount growth, we've been investing in and developing new tools, systems and processes to support and leverage this merchandising talent. Now all of that program support Merchandising 2.0. Historically, the tools, processes and systems that have supported the merchants at Burlington have been very rigid, somewhat department store like, I would say, especially with regard to the visibility to data and responsiveness to in-season trends. Merchandising 2.0 is really designed to transform our buying and planning capabilities, to enable greater flexibility to respond to trends and to provide clearer visibility to up-to-date and actionable business intelligence. This year, we are rolling out many of those new capabilities to the buying and planning organization. We are very excited. And as I have said in the remarks, the merchants are extremely excited about the impact that those capabilities are going to have in terms of driving improved performance and execution over the next few years. So, the main message to take away from my answer is that, yes, we are pleased with how our merchant \u2013 merchandising organization has performed over the last couple of quarters, but we still think we have a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Sure. So, good morning, Chuck. Yes, let me provide some sort of some headlines in terms of the progress we have been making with Burlington 2.0 initiatives. I will break it into stores, real estate and supply chain. So, in terms of stores or store operations, we have done a lot of things over the last few years to make our stores more flexible. It's very important in the off-price model to be able to chase sales at a top line level, but also within the assortment, footwear is doing well to expand footwear, if home is doing well to expand home, etcetera. And also to pull back in certain areas based upon trends. We have also had a lot of focus on getting receipts out to the floor. Let's make sure we get the receipts out in a rapid way as possible. And we have introduced multiple new processes to make our stores more efficient. And that's all been during a time over the last couple of years where the labor market has been very tough. So, we have had to sort of make all those changes while facing headwinds in terms of labor availability. We have also been developing a number of improved tools and systems to help drive efficiency and consistency in stores. Now, some of those systems improvements, which are going to be very important to us, obviously, have a slightly longer lead time. And I think the most important of those systems upgrades, we are probably going to be piloting in the back half of this year, but probably won't roll out till next year. So, we have made a lot of progress. We have done a lot of things. I am very happy with what we have been able to do in stores. Then we move on to real estate, so new stores. We have ramped up our new store opening program with a focus on our new smaller store prototype. We are very happy with the relative economics of that prototype and that's allowed us to ramp up the number of new stores over the last couple of years. And as I have said in my remarks, this year, we expect to open 70 to 80 net new stores. Now, we would like to open more, and we hope in 2024 and 2025, some of the availability that we are seeing from bankruptcies from retail bankruptcies will give us the opportunity to open more. But we will have to see and obviously, we will provide more updates on that as we get closer to the end of the year. Let me finish up with supply chain. There are a number of things that we have been working on in supply chain to increase our flexibility and efficiency. Now again, we have been working on those things in an environment where the labor market, especially in areas that have large warehouses and distribution centers has been tough. And also frankly, receipt volatility has made efficiency tough. But there are a number of actions that we have been taking, some of which we have been able to execute in the short-term, for example, making adjustments to shift schedules or work processes, etcetera. But there are others that have a longer lead time, things like systems changes and automation. So, again, happy with the progress we have made, but I feel like there is a lot more we can do and our supply chain teams are very focused on those opportunities. So, let me sort of take a step back and sort of sum up with an overall assessment. But when I look across the organization, I am very happy with the progress that we have made on our Burlington 2.0 initiatives, especially given the external environment in the last couple of years. I feel like we have moved fast. And because of that, I can see we have made some mistakes. But the changes that we have made are going to make us a much more effective off-price retailer, and they are really going to drive that success in the next few years. You know what, Chuck, let me \u2013 let's break that question into two. Why don't I start \u2013 I will start with the sales confidence. And then maybe Kristin can address the margin and expense outlook. So, on sales, we \u2013 well, first of all, we have recognized we can see that the environment this year is very uncertain. There are lots of things that could happen, recession, banking crisis, government shutdowns, etcetera. But given what we know at this point, I think there are a few things that sort of give us confidence in our back half guidance. We \u2013 I would say there were really three things in particular that allowed us to sort of triangulate on our full year guidance. Number one, our comp in Q1, even though we were disappointed with that comp, we just reported a 4%. Now, our full year guidance is 3% to 5%. For the reasons I described in the remarks, we think that, that 4% was partly driven by transitory headwinds. If you just strip out the tax refund impact, we think it would have been 5%. So again, just based upon the first quarter trend, we feel like we are moving in the right direction to hit our full year comp guidance of 3% to 5%. Second thing to triangulate on that 3% to 5% was when we look ahead here, we feel like we are up against some things from last year. We are anniversarying some negative things from last year. In particular, the very, very high promotional activity in mass retail that happened really from mid-Q2 onwards throughout the summer and into the fall, the mass retailers now are in much better shape in terms of control of their inventories. So, we are not expecting the same level of promotional activity, and we think that will help us. The other thing that we are anniversarying, I mentioned in the remarks, is higher gas prices. That last summer, gas prices were much higher than they are now. So, as we move over the next few months, as long as gas prices stay where they are, we think that will be a tailwind. And then the third thing that we use to triangulate on that 3% to 5% for the full year guidance was that we are up against our own mistakes from last year. And in particular, the decision we made to raise retails in the sort of second quarter and third quarter of last year. As we described, especially on our third quarter and fourth quarter call, we feel like that really hurts us. We are in much better shape now, much, much stronger focus on value. So again, I will go back to what I said at the beginning of my answer, there is plenty of uncertainty out there. But we think \u2013 we feel pretty good about our full year guidance of the 3% to 5% comp. But let me pass it over to Kristin, just to comment on the margin aspects of that. Thanks Chuck. Sure. Well, thank you, Mark. A good question, I think let me start by saying that we feel like we are lucky in our business. We have two very successful analogs, companies that have been in the off-price business for a long time. Companies, if you like, that demonstrate what's possible, what full potential looks like. Now of course, there are differences between each of us, especially when it comes to the demographics of our core customers. Our core customer tends to skew lower-income, younger, higher ethnicity, larger family size, more urban, we love this customer. They have been a major driver of our growth over many years, and they will be again. But over the past year, that customer, in particular, has been under severe economic pressure. The other major difference between us and the other larger off-price retailers is that, I would say, we are newer to the off-price business. And we are less mature, if you like. Our peers have been executing and refining the off-price model for decades. We haven't \u2013 compared to them, we are a relative latecomer to the off-price business. And that lack of maturity shows up in our systems processes and sometimes in our execution. But look, that's why I am here. That's why the whole executive team is here. That's why Burlington is an exciting place to be, exciting place to invest. We are the smallest, least productive and least profitable of the major off-price retailers. We believe but the off-price retail channel will continue to take share over the next several years. And as that happens, we at Burlington feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to drive growth in our sales and profitability. So yes, the last year has had its challenges for sure, but we think the longer term outlook is very, very exciting. Yes. I think it's a very good question. Let me start on the younger shoppers. We have always had a stronger share of younger customers compared to department stores, but also compared to our off-price peers. Our \u2013 when you walk into our stores, you can physically see the customer base and the assortment \u2013 younger. We have a stronger penetration of kids \u2013 of the kids business, juniors, young men's and our shoppers aren't just younger. They tend to be \u2013 obviously, we have talked this morning about the fact that they tend to be lower income. They tend to be more ethnic, they tend to be more urban. Those are the demographic segments, not only are they a core strength for Burlington, that they are, over the long-term growing segments in the United States. And as I have said earlier, given where we are in the economic cycle, those consumers are struggling right now. But over the long-term, that's an attractive set of demographics to have strengthen. Let me expand to the second part of your question. Are there other \u2013 can we expand and broaden our demographics, we \u2013 in order to get to our 2,000 stores, which is the long-term goal for Burlington, we need to be able to operate in a range of different store locations and attract a wide range of demographics, even though the core group that I just described are younger, more ethnic, urban etcetera, even though that's a large segment of the population, we still need to be able to operate effectively in other areas. So, there are a number of things that we are doing in our business to sort of improve \u2013 what I would say is the customization of our assortment by store and therefore, to appeal to a broader demographic not only need to do a customer, but wanted to do a customer. So, I feel pretty good about our ability to do that over time. But it's definitely something that we were aware that we need to work on over the next several years. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in late August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you for your time today."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to David Glick, Group Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, and Treasurer. You may now begin.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's conference call to discuss Burlington's fiscal 2024 third quarter operating results. Our presenters today are Michael O'Sullivan, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kristin Wolfe, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.

Remarks made in this call concerning future expectations, events, strategies, objectives, trends, or projected financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those that are projected in such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those that are described in the company's 10-K for fiscal 2023 and in other filings with the SEC, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Please note that the financial results and expectations we discussed today are on a continuing operations basis. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we discuss today to GAAP measures are included in today's press release. Now, here's Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover four topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our third quarter results. Secondly, I will review our fourth quarter outlook. Thirdly, I will share some comments on our longer-term model and specifically our new store program. And lastly, I will describe our preliminary thinking on our sales and earnings growth outlook for 2025. Then I will pass the call to Kristin to share the financial details. Okay, let's start with our Q3 results. Total sales increased 11% in the third quarter, on top of 12% sales growth last year. The major driver of this growth is our new store opening program. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores, and we are excited by the strength of our new store pipeline. I will talk more about our new store program in a few moments. Comp store sales for the third quarter increased 1%. This was on top of 6% comp growth in the same period in 2023. Our comp sales trend in the third quarter was impacted by significantly warmer temperatures than last year. After stripping out the impact of these warmer temperatures, our underlying comp store sales growth was very healthy. To explain and illustrate this, I am going to provide more context on our Q3 comp performance than I normally would. In the past, I have described Q3 as having two very distinct sales drivers. For the first half of the period, the trend is dominated by back-to-school selling. Typically, this lasts through the second week of September. After that, the trend depends critically on the weather. If the temperature for the remainder of the quarter is cooler than last year, then that helps to drive positive comp growth. On the other hand, if it is warmer than last year, then that is a headwind to comp. At Burlington, we are particularly sensitive to warmer weather in Q3. Many shoppers still think of us as Burlington Coat Factory. In October, our cold weather businesses represented almost a quarter of our sales. This is significantly higher than our peers. Let me break down our comp performance in Q3. In the first six weeks of the quarter, our quarter-to-date trend was up 6%. We were very happy with our back-to-school performance. Then, from mid-September onwards, the trend dropped off significantly. This was driven by much warmer temperatures than last year. I'm going to illustrate this impact with a couple of data points. We track and internally report the sales trend for cold weather categories. These include all the areas that you might imagine, coats, boots, fleece, and so on. For Q3 as a whole, these categories represent about 15% of sales. This mix is much lower in August. Then, as I described a moment ago, by October, this mix expands to almost a quarter of our business. In Q3, the comp store sales trend for these categories was down in the negative teens. Meanwhile, our comp trend in non-cold weather categories, which represents 85% of our business in Q3, was up 4%. In other words, the impact of warmer weather was worth 3 points of comp. If you strip out this impact, then our underlying comp trend in Q3 was positive 4%. This is consistent with the trend that we have seen since March of this year. I should add that this analysis probably understates our underlying trend in Q3. Unseasonably warm temperatures do not just impact the comp sales trend for cold weather merchandise, they also -- they're also a drag on overall traffic coming into the store, which affects every business. Anyway, even leaving aside this additional point, we are very encouraged with our underlying comp sales trend. In addition to this strong underlying trend, I was also very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. 80 basis points of margin improvement on 1% comp sales growth. As Kristin will describe later in this call, this was a very high-quality increase driven by higher merchant margin and supply chain savings. I'd like to make one other point about Q3. Early in the quarter, when we saw strong back-to-school selling, we were careful not to overreact to this. One of the advantages of a conservative plan is that it makes it easier to keep tight control over liquidity and receipts. This means that in the back half of September, we were able to react quickly to the unseasonably warm temperatures. So, despite the sudden slowdown in the sales trend in September and October, at the end of the quarter, our selling inventory on a comp basis was down 2% versus last year. I've talked about this in the past. As an off-price retailer, it is important not just to chase the sales trend when it is strong, but to react quickly when it softens. I am very happy with how our teams reacted in Q3. Because of these actions, our inventories are clean and current, and we are in great shape as we enter the critical holiday selling period. This is a good segue to our Q4 guidance. For all the reasons that I have described, we're optimistic about holiday and Q4 as a whole. For November month-to-date, sales are running ahead of plan. With that said, the big sales weeks are still ahead of us. And as you have probably heard from other retailers, the holiday calendar, specifically the number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, is relatively compressed this year. Given these factors, we are maintaining our previously issued guidance range of flat to 2% comp growth in Q4. I would like to pivot now and talk about our long-term model. A year ago, we shared our financial goals and assumptions for the next five years. The headline from that discussion was that, by 2028, we expect to grow total sales to about $16 billion and operating income to $1.6 billion. Overall, we feel very good about the progress that we are making towards these goals. On our Q4 call in early March, we will get into more specifics and provide a scorecard, if you like, and some commentary on key metrics and assumptions. But I would like to take a few moments today to provide an update on one of the most important drivers of this long-range model, our new store opening program. Including a handful of stores that we opened this month, we have now opened a gross total of 147 new stores this year. This is comprised of 116 new stores and 31 relocations of older, oversized, existing stores. After factoring in 15 store closures, we are now projecting that we will end 2024 with 101 net new stores. Almost all of the stores that we have opened this year are our 25,000 square foot prototype. And most of these stores are in busy strip malls with national co-tenants. We are making rapid progress in transforming our chain. As we have disclosed previously, on average, we expect new stores to run at about $7 million in sales volume in their first full year. It is early, but our 2024 new stores are running well ahead of this expectation. Also, as we have disclosed in the past, we expect store relocations to see an average sales lift of 10%. I am pleased to say that our 2024 relocations are running well ahead of this expectation. Again, it is early, but these run rates reinforce our confidence and our excitement in our new store program over the next several years. Separately, I would like to comment on our new store pipeline. We typically build our new store pipeline by identifying attractive potential new store locations and working directly with individual landlords to secure and lease these sites. I would anticipate that this will continue to be our primary approach going forward. But in the past couple of years, we have been able to supplement our new store pipeline by selectively acquiring existing leases from retailers that are going through a bankruptcy process. This approach has allowed us to move into centers that we might not have otherwise been able to access. Of course, as you would expect, we carefully evaluate the detailed economics of these locations before making any bid. In 2023, we picked up 64 former Bed Bath & Beyond locations through this process. And this year, we have picked up or are working on a few dozen locations from other troubled retailers. We are excited about the quality and the full economic potential of these stores. Adding these deals to our existing pipeline and with the prospect of more opportunities ahead, we are very well positioned to open 100 net new stores in 2025 as well as meet or even exceed our 500 net new store opening goal for the period 2024 through 2028. That is all I planned to say today about our long range model. We will come back in March and provide a more comprehensive update on progress towards our goals. In a moment, I will hand the call over to Kristin, but before I do, let me talk about our outlook for 2025. We think that there is a lot of uncertainty in the year ahead. It is difficult to forecast what will happen with the economy and with consumer spending, and to add to that, the potential impact of tariffs, changes in the tax code and other factors. As we have discussed before, in general, we believe that uncertainty and disruption tend to be good for off-price versus other forms of retail. In addition, there are a number of very exciting internal improvements and initiatives that we believe will help us to drive sales and earnings in the next few years. As we look forward, we feel very optimistic. But when it comes to planning our business, we know that the best posture for us is to plan conservatively and be ready to chase. That is what we have done this year. This playbook has worked well for us. So I anticipate that our 2025 outlook will be for total sales growth of up high single-digits driven by 100 net new stores and comp sales growth of flat to 2%. We would expect some modest operating margin expansion at the high end of this comp range. We will update this initial outlook and share more details in our Q4 call in March. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter results. Total sales grew 11% on top of 12% total sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Comp sales grew 1%, which was on top of 6% last year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 80 basis points versus last year. The drivers of this margin expansion were higher gross margin and leverage on supply chain costs. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the third quarter was 43.9%, an increase of 70 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns, and also due to higher markup from better buying. Freight expenses decreased 20 basis points in the quarter. Product sourcing costs were $210 million versus $200 million in the third quarter of 2023, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was entirely driven by supply chain expense leverage from continued progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A costs in Q3 were 40 basis points lower than last year. When excluding approximately $10 million in expenses associated with the acquisition of Bed Bath & Beyond leases in the prior year, adjusted SG&A de-levered by 10 basis points. Q3 adjusted EBIT margin was 5.6%, 80 basis points above last year. We had guided to 60 basis points to 80 basis points of improvement. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.55, at the high end of our guidance range and represents a 41% increase versus the prior year. Last year's Q3 2023 results exclude approximately $10 million of pre-tax expenses associated with Bed Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were down 2% versus the end of the third quarter in 2023 as we pulled back on cold weather merchandise receipts in reaction to the unfavorable Q3 weather. At the end of the quarter, our reserve inventory was 32% of our total inventory versus 30% of our inventory last year. We are very pleased with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $56 million in common stock. At the end of Q3, we had $325 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August 2025. Before I turn to guidance, I would like to briefly touch on our longer-term supply chain strategy. As we've discussed previously, going forward, we would like to own rather than lease new distribution centers. This will enable us to design these facilities to support the flexibility and efficiency that our off-price model requires. We have a new 2 million square foot DC under construction in Savannah, Georgia, that is on target to be opened in 2026. We intend to own this facility. As a reminder, as previously discussed, we expect our CapEx in 2024 and 2025 to be around 7% of sales, slightly higher than our historical levels. This is driven by our new store opening program and our investment in new distribution centers. In addition, we may also explore opportunities to take ownership of an existing lease distribution center. It is possible that this might make sense for one or two of our existing lease DCs. And we would only pursue opportunities where the economics work. These opportunistic buy versus lease deals are not factored into the CapEx levels that we have discussed previously. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are maintaining our fourth quarter 2024 guidance for comp sales, total sales, EBIT margin, and earnings per share. We are guiding comparable store sales to be flat to up 2% with total sales to increase 5% to 7% for the fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin to decrease by 50 basis points to 80 basis points, unchanged from our previous outlook. This margin outlook still translates to adjusted earnings per share range of $3.55 to $3.75. And it's important to note, as we discussed on our last quarter's earnings call, that the 53rd week calendar shift has a negative impact on Q4 total sales, adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted earnings per share. For fiscal 2024, after factoring in our actual Q3 results and Q4 guidance, this outlook implies comp store sales growth of approximately 2%, total sales to increase 9% to 10%, and EBIT margins to range from an increase of 60 basis points to 70 basis points. Finally, factoring in Q3 actuals, full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.76 to $7.96. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, Kristin. Before I turn the call over to questions, I would like to emphasize three key points from today's call. Firstly, we feel very good about the underlying comp trend that we achieved in the third quarter. Our comp trend after factoring out cold weather categories was around 4%. This was consistent with our comp trends since March of this year. We're also very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. We achieved 80 basis points of leverage on 1% comp growth. Secondly, we believe that we are well positioned as we enter the key holiday selling period in Q4. We are managing our business cautiously, but based on our underlying sales trend in the third quarter and on the strength of our holiday assortments, we are optimistic about our prospects. Thirdly, we feel very good about the progress we are making towards our longer-term financial goals. We will talk more about this progress in our year-end call in March. But we are especially pleased with our new store opening program. The early performance of our 2024 stores has been strong. And our new store pipeline for 2025 and beyond looks very good. I would now like to turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks and good morning. So maybe, Michael, just to kick off, on your cold weather businesses and the sensitivity to warmer weather that you cited, in your remarks you said that the weather impacted your 3Q comp by 300 basis points. Does this include the impact from hurricanes? And then just looking forward, do you see risk in the fourth quarter if the weather were to be unseasonably warm or just any additional color on November, maybe fourth quarter to-date trends I think would be really great.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Before I answer your question, I would like to make a comment about our cold weather businesses. I realize that in listening to our prepared remarks today, investors might get the mistaken impression that our strong position in cold weather merchandise is somehow a problem. It is absolutely not. The fact that we are one of the first retailers that shoppers think of when they need outerwear is a huge strength for us and a source of competitive advantage. The outerwear business is a great business. We are very good at it, and we will continue to look for ways to build and strengthen that business. But with that said, of course, we know that there will be temperature variations from year to year, especially in a transitional month like October. But those variations tend to even out over time. After an October like the one we've just had, where temperatures were well above the long-term average, the odds are very good that the temperatures next October will be cooler than this year. And that's likely to be a tailwind to our comp in 2025. If that happens, then we'll probably call that out on this call next year. And you can be sure that we will not be complaining about it. The key thing with scold weather categories is to be ready for those fluctuations and to manage the business flexibly so we can react up or down. I should also add that as an off-price retailer, there is a silver lining for us. In years like this, where the season to date has been unusually warm, it's likely that in the coming weeks we will see a lot of terrific buying opportunities in outerwear that we can put into reserve and bring out next year. So, with all that as a preface, let me address your specific question. The 3 points of comp that we discussed in the prepared remarks relate exclusively to the impact of warm temperatures. Separately, we estimate that major hurricanes in Q3 impacted our comp by about an additional point. It's not hard for us to estimate that. We can look at local stores that were affected by the hurricanes. We can quantify the impact on their sales during the hurricane period and during any subsequent power outage. Anyway, the bottom line is, if you strip out the warmer temperatures and the hurricane impact, then our third quarter comp growth would have been 5%. By the way, our rationale for not calling out that hurricane impact in the prepared remarks is that we recognize that that affects all retailers or at least all retailers with a presence in those areas. In contrast, the reason that we called out the warmer temperatures or the impact of warmer temperatures is that for all the reasons we've described, those warmer temperatures at this time of year differentially affect us versus other retail companies. Maybe Just wrapping up, on the last part of your question about weather risk in Q4, of course, there might be unfavorable or favorable weather in Q4. It's hard to predict, but there are a couple of reasons why we're comfortable with that risk. Firstly, as I said in the remarks, the quarter is off to a good start with November month to date running ahead of plan. And secondly, it's important to understand that as we get further into the quarter, cold weather selling becomes less important relative to holiday selling and gift giving. In other words, for the next five, six weeks, the customer could come into the store looking for outerwear, but at this point, they're more likely to be looking for toys or gifts or holiday merchandise. Our early selling in those businesses has been strong, so we are optimistic about Q4.\nMatthew Boss: Great. And then a follow-up for Kristin. If you could just elaborate on your comments about inventory levels exiting the third quarter, if there's any imbalance with outerwear inventory tied to the slower 3Q sales trend, or just any residual markdown risk to consider in the fourth quarter.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning. Thanks, Matt. Regarding inventory levels, we were very pleased with how we managed inventory during the third quarter. As Michael described, our merchants were careful not to overreact to the strong back-to-school selling in the first half of the quarter. We reacted quickly to the warmer temperatures and the resulting challenging sales trends and pull back on receipts. And as a result, as I mentioned, we ended Q3 with comp store inventories down 2%. Our inventories are clean and current and we do not have a major markdown liability heading into the fourth quarter. And finally, as it relates to reserve inventory, our penetration increased to 32% of total inventory versus 30% last year. We are very happy with the great buys we were able to make. We feel good about our reserves, especially the content and values. And finally, I should add, as Michael just mentioned, the slow start to outerwear could perhaps translate to great buying opportunities in the category later in the season.\nMatthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning, everyone. Two from me. Michael, first, I guess I was wondering if you could share, you've helped us out in the past, just comments on the health of the low income consumer. I know dollar stores have been struggling this year, but this doesn't seem to have affected your business. I guess just what are you seeing in your customer research, your underlying trends within that segment would be great.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. Yes, as you know, the lower income customer is a very important customer to us. We tend to index much higher among this demographic than our retail peers. We're very focused on offering great value to that customer, and I would say that we're more tuned in now, more tuned in than we ever were before into what is happening with that customer demographic. I can't really comment on what's happening with dollar stores. Their business is so different to ours given their focus on consumables. But instead, let me describe what we are seeing with the data we have around the lower income customer. One of the things that we track very closely is the performance of our stores based on the demographics of their local trade area. So we segment our stores based upon the demographics of the local trade area and we look at their sales trend. Some of our highest volume and most productive stores are in lower income trade areas. And two years ago in 2022, those stores were underperforming the chain. Now, because they are relatively high volume, that had a big impact on our overall comp trend. If I fast forward to today, our stores in lower income trade areas are outperforming the chain based on comments that we've heard from other discretionary retailers that are focused on lower income customers. We think that may be part of a general trend. We think that customer is looking for great value and maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up. I should also add that in that analysis of store performance by trade area demographics, we are seeing healthy performance in other income bands as well. And we see that as evidence that shoppers from moderate to higher income bands may be trading down. But coming back to the lower income customer, as we've discussed previously, that customer really bore the brunt of cost of living increases in 2022. Unlike other income groups, those shoppers don't have savings or debt capacity that they can use to cushion the impact of higher rent or grocery prices. So in 2022, that customer had to pull back sharply on discretionary spending. Over the past year or so what we're seeing is that as their real incomes have stabilized and started to pick back up, they're spending more and we think that's helping to support the strength of our underlying trend.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Super helpful. And then maybe follow-up for Kristin. Just on margin expansion, can you maybe give us additional color on the drivers of the margin in Q3 and maybe suggest some details on the Q4 guide, what's embedded in your plan for Q4 margin?\nKristin Wolfe: Great. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the third quarter. We were pleased to deliver the 80 basis points of operating margin expansion, especially on a 1% comp. I'll provide a little bit more color on those drivers. Within the gross margin line, the merch margin was up 50 basis points. This was driven by lower markdowns as we had strong regular price selling and faster turns. We also got a bit of help from higher markup driven by better buying. And then in gross margin, freight as a percentage of sales also improved by 20 basis points. Moving down on product sourcing costs, as we mentioned, supply chain leveraged by 50 basis points. This was driven by our continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. These are primarily productivity improvements in distribution centers. And then excluding the impact of Bed Bath & Beyond leases last year, adjusted SG&A was higher by 10 basis points due to deleverage of fixed costs on a 1% comp and the balance of the P&L de-levered by about 30 basis points including depreciation and other income. So that was kind of the third quarter. If we turn now to the fourth quarter, we're maintaining our previously issued guidance. So that was a 5% to 7% total sales growth, a flat to 2% comp growth, and a 50 basis points to 80 basis point decline in EBIT margin. And there are several drivers of the lower projected EBIT margin in Q4 that I want to talk through. First, we have a few transitory headwinds in gross margin in the fourth quarter. There's some incremental ocean freight costs and merch margins that we referenced on last quarter's call with the exposure to the spot market. And clearance levels are expected to be more similar to last year's levels that will provide less merch margin benefit than we've seen year-to-date. Secondly, we're accruing a higher year-over-year shortage rate compared to last year. We will, of course, true this up with our physical inventory at the end of the fiscal year. Thirdly, we're lapping the cost savings in our supply chain that we started to benefit from in the fourth quarter last year. So there are less supply chain productivity benefits we expect in Q4. And the final point on the fourth quarter is as we discussed on last quarter's call, there is an impact for us with the 53rd week calendar shift. We're about one week ahead of last year when we compare the quarters year-over-year. So, for comp store sales, we shift or we adjust for this and we line up the weeks. But for total sales growth, there's an impact on sales, margin and earnings. Essentially, we lose a high volume, higher margin week in November and then we gain a lower volume, lower margin week in January and this translates into lower total sales growth in Q4 versus last year and we experience more fixed cost de-leverage. So those are really the drivers of Q4 EBIT margin outlook. But one final note I want to make, I wouldn't extrapolate that Q4 margin trend into 2025. There are several transitory and timing factors in impacting EBIT margin in Q4. And as we shared in the prepared remarks, we would expect modest operating margin expansion in \u201825 on a 2% comp.\nIke Boruchow: Awesome, thanks so much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, I realize there's a lot of external uncertainty, but what impact do you think the policies of the new administration might have on your business over the next few years, and how are you preparing for this?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Lorraine. I think that's what they might call a $64,000 question. The headline, I think, is it's very difficult to predict. If I think about it, there are some policies that I could absolutely imagine might help our business, especially policies that enhance the real incomes or the discretionary spending power of our core customers. For example, lower taxes on overtime pay or on tips or higher child tax credit or policies that bring down the cost of energy. And of course, as a separate item, if corporate taxes are reduced, then that would be very helpful to our business in terms of earnings and cash. We are a domestic US retailer. We don't have foreign subsidiaries. Our earnings are all in the United States. So lower corporate taxes would have a huge impact. Of course, there are also risks and potential headwinds. For example, if inflation were to pick up again or if there were an economic slowdown. And then there are policies such as tariffs or tighter immigration controls or reductions in federal programs where the potential impact, I think, really depends on the scale of the policy. For example, on tariffs, we don't know how significant those will be, what categories they'll apply to, or even which countries. I think we just have to wait and see the details before we make an assessment. But maybe I should just make a general comment. My experience has been that whenever there is significant uncertainty or disruption in the external environment, then while that can be a headwind and a headache for everyone, including us in the short term, the uncertainty and disruption is often very good for off-price retail in the end. The reason why uncertainty disruptions often work out well for off-price is that the off-price business model, when it's well executed, is better able to handle the uncertainty and respond to whatever happens. The implication for us is that we need to execute our business well. In other words, plan conservatively, maintain flexibility, and be ready to react. If we do that, then there may be some bumps along the road, but I believe that things will work out well for us.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. And then, Kristin, can you provide any additional details on how you're thinking about the outlook for 2025? In your remarks, you mentioned the possible comp range of flat to plus 2% and the modest margin expansion at the high end. I'm curious about your confidence in the level of margin expansion and what the major drivers of expansion are likely to be.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Lorraine. It's a good question. First, I'd caveat a bit that what we've shared with you is our preliminary plan for fiscal \u201825 and that could change obviously if conditions change over the course of the next few months and as Michael just described, there really do remain a lot of unknowns whether it's fiscal policy, tariffs, or the health of our core customer et cetera. But that said, given what we know today, we've done a lot of work on our preliminary budget for next year and we can share some high-level thinking. First, on a flat to 2% comp, we would expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by 100 net new stores. And while we would, of course, strive to do better than this, planning our comp sales and our expenses on the conservative comp range gives us flexibility to react to our business, to effectively chase and to flow through any upside, as well as more effectively manage any downside risks. And at the 2% comp, we would expect to get some modest operating margin improvement, perhaps 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Similar to 2024, we expect most of the same drivers, including merch margin improvement and continued benefit from supply chain productivity initiatives. And I do want to acknowledge that this operating margin expansion is a bit less than where we started fiscal 2024 and there are just a couple of reasons for that. First, we\u2019ve captured supply chain cost savings at a faster pace than we've expected. In a long-range plan we shared this time last year, we spoke to driving 100 basis points of supply chain cost savings over the first three years in our long-range plan. We will likely recognize about half of that, around 50 basis points in fiscal 2024. So the balance we expect over fiscal \u201825 and \u201826. And secondly, we're being a bit more cautious on freight for next year. We've made very good progress on freight this year, but we want to plan conservatively here based on uncertainty, certainly around tariffs, and what impact that could have on freight rates next year. So ultimately we expect the margin improvement on a 2% comp to come from incremental merchandise margin improvement from faster turns and lower markdowns and additional supply chain efficiencies. These would be offset by some deleverage in store costs like occupancy on the 2% comp. And I also want to call out that for every 100 basis points of comp above the 2% comp, we would expect 10 basis points to 15 basis points of incremental EBIT margin. So, of course, a final caveat, these assumptions could change as the external environment evolves, but I did want to give a sense for our assumptions at this stage as we've done historically.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, Lorraine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kernan from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning, congrats on the continued margin expansion.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nJohn Kernan: Michael, maybe another $64,000 question here. You've been at Burlington for five years. That's a long time for a CEO in this sector these days. There's been a number of CEO turnover announcements recently, including among one of your off-price peers. How are you thinking about your own timeframe in the role and how are you feeling about the executive team at Burlington overall?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, John. That's two $64, 000 questions. That's great. The direct answer to your question is that I'm not going anywhere. I'm a young man and I'm not thinking of retirement. I'm 100% committed to Burlington. But maybe I should just take a minute to expand on that answer. In the 2023 to 2028 long-range plan, we've laid out, I think, fairly ambitious growth goals, 500 net new stores, 60% higher sales, and a tripling of operating income. I intend to be around to hit those financial targets. And I should add that those growth numbers are not just -- just the beginning for Burlington. We have potential well beyond 2028. Leaving aside the numbers though, on a personal level, I feel really vested in driving our business to its full potential, and in the specific initiatives that will get us there. And we're doing some tremendously exciting things in merchandising, localization, supply chain, store environment, and with our new store and store relocation programs. And I plan to be right here working with my team to support and help drive those specific programs. So lastly, let me talk about the team. I don't mean to brag, but I genuinely feel like I've assembled the A-Team here at Burlington. Across the company, we've been able to bring in tremendous talent. That's especially true at the senior level. We have a huge amount of off-price experience. But we've also successfully brought in functional and category expertise and experience from other retail environments. Add to that, we have a very strong and experienced base of long-tenured and homegrown Burlington talent. And whenever you put together a new team like that, it can take a little bit of time to gel, but over the past 12 to 18 months, I've seen a real maturation in that group. I think our senior leaders are operating very effectively as a team.\nJohn Kernan: Got it, thank you, that's good to hear. And then Kristin, can you share some more details on the supply chain savings initiatives? You spoke to some of these in response to Lorraine's question. We can see in the model you've achieved strong leverage on expenses throughout this year, but how do we think about the basis point opportunity related to supply chain expenses in \u201825 and beyond?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, John. Appreciate the question. We are really pleased that supply chain de-leverage recapture is running ahead of schedule. As I just described in an earlier question, we estimate that supply chain productivity improvement, we target driving potentially 100 basis points of the 400 basis points of margin improvement we outline in the long-range plan. Again, in Q3, supply chain leveraged 50 basis points as our efficiency initiatives helped drive cost savings in DC. We have a number of productivity initiatives we're working on in DC operations. We're redesigning how merchandise flows within the DC, automating select processes, ultimately reducing touches and time to process merchandise and saving labor dollars in DC. And as I mentioned a few moments ago looking ahead into Q4, it's important to keep in mind that we will be lapping the quarter last year when we first started to drive meaningful cost savings in our supply chain. In Q4 last year we leveraged supply chain expense by 40 basis points and this was a real turning point for us on the expense line a year ago. So we would expect to show more modest leverage on supply chain in Q4 this year. We'll probably end \u201824 showing product sourcing leverage of around 50 basis points better than last year. So we're about halfway there to the 100 basis points goal embedded in our five-year plan. And then longer term, beyond 2028, we do have an opportunity to drive incremental leverage as we modernize our supply chain with new, larger, and much more automated DCs that we expect to open to support our growth. As I mentioned, our southeast DC in Savannah Georgia is slated to open in 2026 and it's a great example of this. And with new DCs, we have an opportunity to design these distribution centers for off-price and with more automation.\nJohn Kernan: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning and thank you for taking our question. Michael, can you provide an update on the strategy to increase the mix of better brands within the Burlington assortment?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning, Brooke. Thank you for the question. I think I'm going to reframe your question slightly. Rather than just focusing on better brands, I would say that for the last couple of years, we've been working to elevate our assortments and thereby deliver even better value to the customer. Now, in businesses like, say, sportswear or footwear, that means a higher mix of better or recognizable brands. But in other areas like home or juniors, it's more about the quality or the design or the fashion. Now together with price, those are all drivers of value. And the importance of each driver depends on the business and also depends on the customer, which is why our [Technical Difficulty] work very hard to make sure that we're offering great value, but within the context of a good, better, best assortment. Now, as we've discussed before, this isn't a new strategy. When you boil it down, the strategy is and always has been to offer great value to shoppers. Elevating our assortment in terms of brand mix, fashion, design, and quality is more of an evolution rather than a revolution. There's no significant hit to merchant margin here. In fact, as Kristin described in the prepared remarks, in Q3, we achieved an increase in merchant margin driven by lower markdowns and higher markup. Together with our strong underlying sales trend, we see that as evidence that our elevation strategy is working.\nBrooke Roach: Great. And then just for Kristin, tariffs have been mentioned a few times on today's call. Can you speak in more detail on how you're thinking about tariffs should they be implemented and the potential impact on Burlington's business?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, Brooke. Yeah, it's a very good question. It's one that's pretty difficult to answer at this point. Michael talked about next year's uncertainties, including the unknowns on tariffs. But I can provide some tariff data and some history to put this in context. So our direct import exposure where we are directly paying the tariffs to import goods into the US is relatively small and much lower than many retailers. In 2024, we expect to have directly imported about 8% of our merchandise. And of those direct imports, the majority is from China. So let's call it about 7% of our merchandise has direct tariff exposure to China. So, well over 90% of our buys are on merchandise where we are not directly paying the tariff. And as an off-price retailer with a flexible buying model, we do have the ability to negotiate the price we pay and to mitigate that impact. And most importantly, we will ensure we continue to provide value. We provide value to the customers and sustain a value gap, i.e., savings, versus full price retailers. And as we did in 2018 and the 2019 timeframe, we will look for strategies to offset incremental tariffs, we'll work with vendor partners on the cost side, as well as examining our sourcing, where we source from. And we managed as well during the last iteration of tariffs, and we actually saw our merge margin was up in both fiscal \u201818 and \u201819. And finally, and most importantly, as Michael kind of described earlier, tariffs will likely lead or could lead to disruption, which is ultimately good for off-price. Manufacturers may build up inventory levels to get out in front of tariffs or production in various categories could move from one country to another. These sorts of disruptions do create buying opportunities for off-price. So ultimately we acknowledge there's tremendous uncertainty around tariffs, but our off-price model is flexible in terms of what we buy and from where. And our direct import penetration is low. So ultimately, we see that as a positive as we face this potential issue.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Brooke.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nAlex Straton: Thanks a lot. Maybe for Michael, taking a step back, what Burlington 2.0 initiatives are you most excited about right now? And how will those show up in Burlington's financial profile over time?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning, Alex. Thank you for the question. I really like this question. Let me talk a little bit about. Well, first of all, there are many important initiatives going on across the company in merchandising, stores, supply chain, real estate and IT. But to answer your question, maybe I should just highlight two specific initiatives that we've recently rolled out and that I expect will have a big impact over time. Firstly, in 2023, we completely refreshed and updated the suite of reports that our merchants use to analyze sales trends. But then, in the first half of this year, so quite recently, we followed that up and rolled out a new in-season trending process. Now that allows merchants and planners to more frequently and rapidly react to what they're seeing in those sales reports. They can re-fork our sales and they can move open to buy dollars into businesses that are trending. And they can pull money out of areas that are not trending. Now, to some degree, of course, they've always been able to do that to some degree. But the new reports are more accurate and up to date, and they provide our merchants with better visibility to support that reporting process. And add to that, the new process enables greater frequency and speed in making those changes. So, I think those improvements were already helping us to more rapidly and effectively chase or pull back based on the trend. Secondly, in the summer, we turned on new store-level sales and allocation algorithms to more effectively respond to trends of the individual store class level and thereby drive greater customization of the assortment by store. Now, those localization algorithms are based on machine learning and over time, they're going to optimize the allocation of receipts based on store class level selling. That'll take some time for that effect to really build, but it should drive stronger sales, faster turns and lower markdowns. I think that the two initiatives I've just described provide a good illustration of what we're trying to do with Burlington 2.0. We know that when it comes to processes, systems, tools, and execution, we're behind our off-price peers. But that's just another way of saying we have huge opportunity and upside. And we're very focused on that upside and on narrowing that gap versus our peers. The two initiatives that I've described, I think, are good examples of how we're going to do that.\nAlex Straton: That's really exciting. Thanks for sharing that. Maybe one more near-term question for Kristin. Can you just provide some color on comp trends in the quarter as it relates to regular price versus clearance selling?\nKristin Wolfe: Alex, good morning. Yeah, thanks for the question. I acknowledge that this was a benefit to merch margin in Q3, but let me provide just a little more detail. Our regular price selling continues to be very strong. In the third quarter, regular price sales once again outpaced our trend. Regular price selling did a 3 comp increase in Q3, 200 basis points above our overall trend. We continue to benefit from our approach of chasing the business, operating with leaner inventories, driving faster turns, and thereby incurring lower markdowns which then translates to higher merchandise margins. And we really do see this as further validation on our merch 2.0 initiatives, our growth and maturation of our merchandising team, and strong inventory control. And I believe I mentioned this in an earlier question, but it's worth reiterating, in regards to Q4, clearance levels are projected to be more similar to last year's levels, which would provide less merch margin benefit in Q4 than we've seen year to date.\nDavid Glick: Operator, I think we're at time. You can turn the call back to Michael.\nOperator: Thank you so much. We are now done with the Q&A session. I'd now like to hand back over to Michael O'Sullivan for a final remark.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, let me close the call by thanking everyone for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter 2024 fiscal results. I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter results. Total sales grew 11% on top of 12% total sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Comp sales grew 1%, which was on top of 6% last year. This result was at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 80 basis points versus last year. The drivers of this margin expansion were higher gross margin and leverage on supply chain costs. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the third quarter was 43.9%, an increase of 70 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns, and also due to higher markup from better buying. Freight expenses decreased 20 basis points in the quarter. Product sourcing costs were $210 million versus $200 million in the third quarter of 2023, decreasing 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was entirely driven by supply chain expense leverage from continued progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A costs in Q3 were 40 basis points lower than last year. When excluding approximately $10 million in expenses associated with the acquisition of Bed Bath & Beyond leases in the prior year, adjusted SG&A de-levered by 10 basis points. Q3 adjusted EBIT margin was 5.6%, 80 basis points above last year. We had guided to 60 basis points to 80 basis points of improvement. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.55, at the high end of our guidance range and represents a 41% increase versus the prior year. Last year's Q3 2023 results exclude approximately $10 million of pre-tax expenses associated with Bed Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were down 2% versus the end of the third quarter in 2023 as we pulled back on cold weather merchandise receipts in reaction to the unfavorable Q3 weather. At the end of the quarter, our reserve inventory was 32% of our total inventory versus 30% of our inventory last year. We are very pleased with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $56 million in common stock. At the end of Q3, we had $325 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August 2025. Before I turn to guidance, I would like to briefly touch on our longer-term supply chain strategy. As we've discussed previously, going forward, we would like to own rather than lease new distribution centers. This will enable us to design these facilities to support the flexibility and efficiency that our off-price model requires. We have a new 2 million square foot DC under construction in Savannah, Georgia, that is on target to be opened in 2026. We intend to own this facility. As a reminder, as previously discussed, we expect our CapEx in 2024 and 2025 to be around 7% of sales, slightly higher than our historical levels. This is driven by our new store opening program and our investment in new distribution centers. In addition, we may also explore opportunities to take ownership of an existing lease distribution center. It is possible that this might make sense for one or two of our existing lease DCs. And we would only pursue opportunities where the economics work. These opportunistic buy versus lease deals are not factored into the CapEx levels that we have discussed previously. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are maintaining our fourth quarter 2024 guidance for comp sales, total sales, EBIT margin, and earnings per share. We are guiding comparable store sales to be flat to up 2% with total sales to increase 5% to 7% for the fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin to decrease by 50 basis points to 80 basis points, unchanged from our previous outlook. This margin outlook still translates to adjusted earnings per share range of $3.55 to $3.75. And it's important to note, as we discussed on our last quarter's earnings call, that the 53rd week calendar shift has a negative impact on Q4 total sales, adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted earnings per share. For fiscal 2024, after factoring in our actual Q3 results and Q4 guidance, this outlook implies comp store sales growth of approximately 2%, total sales to increase 9% to 10%, and EBIT margins to range from an increase of 60 basis points to 70 basis points. Finally, factoring in Q3 actuals, full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.76 to $7.96. I will now turn the call back to Michael. Good morning. Thanks, Matt. Regarding inventory levels, we were very pleased with how we managed inventory during the third quarter. As Michael described, our merchants were careful not to overreact to the strong back-to-school selling in the first half of the quarter. We reacted quickly to the warmer temperatures and the resulting challenging sales trends and pull back on receipts. And as a result, as I mentioned, we ended Q3 with comp store inventories down 2%. Our inventories are clean and current and we do not have a major markdown liability heading into the fourth quarter. And finally, as it relates to reserve inventory, our penetration increased to 32% of total inventory versus 30% last year. We are very happy with the great buys we were able to make. We feel good about our reserves, especially the content and values. And finally, I should add, as Michael just mentioned, the slow start to outerwear could perhaps translate to great buying opportunities in the category later in the season. Thanks, Matt. Great. Good morning, Ike. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the third quarter. We were pleased to deliver the 80 basis points of operating margin expansion, especially on a 1% comp. I'll provide a little bit more color on those drivers. Within the gross margin line, the merch margin was up 50 basis points. This was driven by lower markdowns as we had strong regular price selling and faster turns. We also got a bit of help from higher markup driven by better buying. And then in gross margin, freight as a percentage of sales also improved by 20 basis points. Moving down on product sourcing costs, as we mentioned, supply chain leveraged by 50 basis points. This was driven by our continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. These are primarily productivity improvements in distribution centers. And then excluding the impact of Bed Bath & Beyond leases last year, adjusted SG&A was higher by 10 basis points due to deleverage of fixed costs on a 1% comp and the balance of the P&L de-levered by about 30 basis points including depreciation and other income. So that was kind of the third quarter. If we turn now to the fourth quarter, we're maintaining our previously issued guidance. So that was a 5% to 7% total sales growth, a flat to 2% comp growth, and a 50 basis points to 80 basis point decline in EBIT margin. And there are several drivers of the lower projected EBIT margin in Q4 that I want to talk through. First, we have a few transitory headwinds in gross margin in the fourth quarter. There's some incremental ocean freight costs and merch margins that we referenced on last quarter's call with the exposure to the spot market. And clearance levels are expected to be more similar to last year's levels that will provide less merch margin benefit than we've seen year-to-date. Secondly, we're accruing a higher year-over-year shortage rate compared to last year. We will, of course, true this up with our physical inventory at the end of the fiscal year. Thirdly, we're lapping the cost savings in our supply chain that we started to benefit from in the fourth quarter last year. So there are less supply chain productivity benefits we expect in Q4. And the final point on the fourth quarter is as we discussed on last quarter's call, there is an impact for us with the 53rd week calendar shift. We're about one week ahead of last year when we compare the quarters year-over-year. So, for comp store sales, we shift or we adjust for this and we line up the weeks. But for total sales growth, there's an impact on sales, margin and earnings. Essentially, we lose a high volume, higher margin week in November and then we gain a lower volume, lower margin week in January and this translates into lower total sales growth in Q4 versus last year and we experience more fixed cost de-leverage. So those are really the drivers of Q4 EBIT margin outlook. But one final note I want to make, I wouldn't extrapolate that Q4 margin trend into 2025. There are several transitory and timing factors in impacting EBIT margin in Q4. And as we shared in the prepared remarks, we would expect modest operating margin expansion in \u201825 on a 2% comp. Thanks, Lorraine. It's a good question. First, I'd caveat a bit that what we've shared with you is our preliminary plan for fiscal \u201825 and that could change obviously if conditions change over the course of the next few months and as Michael just described, there really do remain a lot of unknowns whether it's fiscal policy, tariffs, or the health of our core customer et cetera. But that said, given what we know today, we've done a lot of work on our preliminary budget for next year and we can share some high-level thinking. First, on a flat to 2% comp, we would expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by 100 net new stores. And while we would, of course, strive to do better than this, planning our comp sales and our expenses on the conservative comp range gives us flexibility to react to our business, to effectively chase and to flow through any upside, as well as more effectively manage any downside risks. And at the 2% comp, we would expect to get some modest operating margin improvement, perhaps 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Similar to 2024, we expect most of the same drivers, including merch margin improvement and continued benefit from supply chain productivity initiatives. And I do want to acknowledge that this operating margin expansion is a bit less than where we started fiscal 2024 and there are just a couple of reasons for that. First, we've captured supply chain cost savings at a faster pace than we've expected. In a long-range plan we shared this time last year, we spoke to driving 100 basis points of supply chain cost savings over the first three years in our long-range plan. We will likely recognize about half of that, around 50 basis points in fiscal 2024. So the balance we expect over fiscal \u201825 and \u201826. And secondly, we're being a bit more cautious on freight for next year. We've made very good progress on freight this year, but we want to plan conservatively here based on uncertainty, certainly around tariffs, and what impact that could have on freight rates next year. So ultimately we expect the margin improvement on a 2% comp to come from incremental merchandise margin improvement from faster turns and lower markdowns and additional supply chain efficiencies. These would be offset by some deleverage in store costs like occupancy on the 2% comp. And I also want to call out that for every 100 basis points of comp above the 2% comp, we would expect 10 basis points to 15 basis points of incremental EBIT margin. So, of course, a final caveat, these assumptions could change as the external environment evolves, but I did want to give a sense for our assumptions at this stage as we've done historically. Good morning, John. Appreciate the question. We are really pleased that supply chain de-leverage recapture is running ahead of schedule. As I just described in an earlier question, we estimate that supply chain productivity improvement, we target driving potentially 100 basis points of the 400 basis points of margin improvement we outline in the long-range plan. Again, in Q3, supply chain leveraged 50 basis points as our efficiency initiatives helped drive cost savings in DC. We have a number of productivity initiatives we're working on in DC operations. We're redesigning how merchandise flows within the DC, automating select processes, ultimately reducing touches and time to process merchandise and saving labor dollars in DC. And as I mentioned a few moments ago looking ahead into Q4, it's important to keep in mind that we will be lapping the quarter last year when we first started to drive meaningful cost savings in our supply chain. In Q4 last year we leveraged supply chain expense by 40 basis points and this was a real turning point for us on the expense line a year ago. So we would expect to show more modest leverage on supply chain in Q4 this year. We'll probably end \u201824 showing product sourcing leverage of around 50 basis points better than last year. So we're about halfway there to the 100 basis points goal embedded in our five-year plan. And then longer term, beyond 2028, we do have an opportunity to drive incremental leverage as we modernize our supply chain with new, larger, and much more automated DCs that we expect to open to support our growth. As I mentioned, our southeast DC in Savannah Georgia is slated to open in 2026 and it's a great example of this. And with new DCs, we have an opportunity to design these distribution centers for off-price and with more automation. Good morning, Brooke. Yeah, it's a very good question. It's one that's pretty difficult to answer at this point. Michael talked about next year's uncertainties, including the unknowns on tariffs. But I can provide some tariff data and some history to put this in context. So our direct import exposure where we are directly paying the tariffs to import goods into the US is relatively small and much lower than many retailers. In 2024, we expect to have directly imported about 8% of our merchandise. And of those direct imports, the majority is from China. So let's call it about 7% of our merchandise has direct tariff exposure to China. So, well over 90% of our buys are on merchandise where we are not directly paying the tariff. And as an off-price retailer with a flexible buying model, we do have the ability to negotiate the price we pay and to mitigate that impact. And most importantly, we will ensure we continue to provide value. We provide value to the customers and sustain a value gap, i.e., savings, versus full price retailers. And as we did in 2018 and the 2019 timeframe, we will look for strategies to offset incremental tariffs, we'll work with vendor partners on the cost side, as well as examining our sourcing, where we source from. And we managed as well during the last iteration of tariffs, and we actually saw our merge margin was up in both fiscal \u201818 and \u201819. And finally, and most importantly, as Michael kind of described earlier, tariffs will likely lead or could lead to disruption, which is ultimately good for off-price. Manufacturers may build up inventory levels to get out in front of tariffs or production in various categories could move from one country to another. These sorts of disruptions do create buying opportunities for off-price. So ultimately we acknowledge there's tremendous uncertainty around tariffs, but our off-price model is flexible in terms of what we buy and from where. And our direct import penetration is low. So ultimately, we see that as a positive as we face this potential issue. Thanks, Brooke. Alex, good morning. Yeah, thanks for the question. I acknowledge that this was a benefit to merch margin in Q3, but let me provide just a little more detail. Our regular price selling continues to be very strong. In the third quarter, regular price sales once again outpaced our trend. Regular price selling did a 3 comp increase in Q3, 200 basis points above our overall trend.

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover four topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our third quarter results. Secondly, I will review our fourth quarter outlook. Thirdly, I will share some comments on our longer-term model and specifically our new store program. And lastly, I will describe our preliminary thinking on our sales and earnings growth outlook for 2025. Then I will pass the call to Kristin to share the financial details. Okay, let's start with our Q3 results. Total sales increased 11% in the third quarter, on top of 12% sales growth last year. The major driver of this growth is our new store opening program. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores, and we are excited by the strength of our new store pipeline. I will talk more about our new store program in a few moments. Comp store sales for the third quarter increased 1%. This was on top of 6% comp growth in the same period in 2023. Our comp sales trend in the third quarter was impacted by significantly warmer temperatures than last year. After stripping out the impact of these warmer temperatures, our underlying comp store sales growth was very healthy. To explain and illustrate this, I am going to provide more context on our Q3 comp performance than I normally would. In the past, I have described Q3 as having two very distinct sales drivers. For the first half of the period, the trend is dominated by back-to-school selling. Typically, this lasts through the second week of September. After that, the trend depends critically on the weather. If the temperature for the remainder of the quarter is cooler than last year, then that helps to drive positive comp growth. On the other hand, if it is warmer than last year, then that is a headwind to comp. At Burlington, we are particularly sensitive to warmer weather in Q3. Many shoppers still think of us as Burlington Coat Factory. In October, our cold weather businesses represented almost a quarter of our sales. This is significantly higher than our peers. Let me break down our comp performance in Q3. In the first six weeks of the quarter, our quarter-to-date trend was up 6%. We were very happy with our back-to-school performance. Then, from mid-September onwards, the trend dropped off significantly. This was driven by much warmer temperatures than last year. I'm going to illustrate this impact with a couple of data points. We track and internally report the sales trend for cold weather categories. These include all the areas that you might imagine, coats, boots, fleece, and so on. For Q3 as a whole, these categories represent about 15% of sales. This mix is much lower in August. Then, as I described a moment ago, by October, this mix expands to almost a quarter of our business. In Q3, the comp store sales trend for these categories was down in the negative teens. Meanwhile, our comp trend in non-cold weather categories, which represents 85% of our business in Q3, was up 4%. In other words, the impact of warmer weather was worth 3 points of comp. If you strip out this impact, then our underlying comp trend in Q3 was positive 4%. This is consistent with the trend that we have seen since March of this year. I should add that this analysis probably understates our underlying trend in Q3. Unseasonably warm temperatures do not just impact the comp sales trend for cold weather merchandise, they also -- they're also a drag on overall traffic coming into the store, which affects every business. Anyway, even leaving aside this additional point, we are very encouraged with our underlying comp sales trend. In addition to this strong underlying trend, I was also very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. 80 basis points of margin improvement on 1% comp sales growth. As Kristin will describe later in this call, this was a very high-quality increase driven by higher merchant margin and supply chain savings. I'd like to make one other point about Q3. Early in the quarter, when we saw strong back-to-school selling, we were careful not to overreact to this. One of the advantages of a conservative plan is that it makes it easier to keep tight control over liquidity and receipts. This means that in the back half of September, we were able to react quickly to the unseasonably warm temperatures. So, despite the sudden slowdown in the sales trend in September and October, at the end of the quarter, our selling inventory on a comp basis was down 2% versus last year. I've talked about this in the past. As an off-price retailer, it is important not just to chase the sales trend when it is strong, but to react quickly when it softens. I am very happy with how our teams reacted in Q3. Because of these actions, our inventories are clean and current, and we are in great shape as we enter the critical holiday selling period. This is a good segue to our Q4 guidance. For all the reasons that I have described, we're optimistic about holiday and Q4 as a whole. For November month-to-date, sales are running ahead of plan. With that said, the big sales weeks are still ahead of us. And as you have probably heard from other retailers, the holiday calendar, specifically the number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, is relatively compressed this year. Given these factors, we are maintaining our previously issued guidance range of flat to 2% comp growth in Q4. I would like to pivot now and talk about our long-term model. A year ago, we shared our financial goals and assumptions for the next five years. The headline from that discussion was that, by 2028, we expect to grow total sales to about $16 billion and operating income to $1.6 billion. Overall, we feel very good about the progress that we are making towards these goals. On our Q4 call in early March, we will get into more specifics and provide a scorecard, if you like, and some commentary on key metrics and assumptions. But I would like to take a few moments today to provide an update on one of the most important drivers of this long-range model, our new store opening program. Including a handful of stores that we opened this month, we have now opened a gross total of 147 new stores this year. This is comprised of 116 new stores and 31 relocations of older, oversized, existing stores. After factoring in 15 store closures, we are now projecting that we will end 2024 with 101 net new stores. Almost all of the stores that we have opened this year are our 25,000 square foot prototype. And most of these stores are in busy strip malls with national co-tenants. We are making rapid progress in transforming our chain. As we have disclosed previously, on average, we expect new stores to run at about $7 million in sales volume in their first full year. It is early, but our 2024 new stores are running well ahead of this expectation. Also, as we have disclosed in the past, we expect store relocations to see an average sales lift of 10%. I am pleased to say that our 2024 relocations are running well ahead of this expectation. Again, it is early, but these run rates reinforce our confidence and our excitement in our new store program over the next several years. Separately, I would like to comment on our new store pipeline. We typically build our new store pipeline by identifying attractive potential new store locations and working directly with individual landlords to secure and lease these sites. I would anticipate that this will continue to be our primary approach going forward. But in the past couple of years, we have been able to supplement our new store pipeline by selectively acquiring existing leases from retailers that are going through a bankruptcy process. This approach has allowed us to move into centers that we might not have otherwise been able to access. Of course, as you would expect, we carefully evaluate the detailed economics of these locations before making any bid. In 2023, we picked up 64 former Bed Bath & Beyond locations through this process. And this year, we have picked up or are working on a few dozen locations from other troubled retailers. We are excited about the quality and the full economic potential of these stores. Adding these deals to our existing pipeline and with the prospect of more opportunities ahead, we are very well positioned to open 100 net new stores in 2025 as well as meet or even exceed our 500 net new store opening goal for the period 2024 through 2028. That is all I planned to say today about our long range model. We will come back in March and provide a more comprehensive update on progress towards our goals. In a moment, I will hand the call over to Kristin, but before I do, let me talk about our outlook for 2025. We think that there is a lot of uncertainty in the year ahead. It is difficult to forecast what will happen with the economy and with consumer spending, and to add to that, the potential impact of tariffs, changes in the tax code and other factors. As we have discussed before, in general, we believe that uncertainty and disruption tend to be good for off-price versus other forms of retail. In addition, there are a number of very exciting internal improvements and initiatives that we believe will help us to drive sales and earnings in the next few years. As we look forward, we feel very optimistic. But when it comes to planning our business, we know that the best posture for us is to plan conservatively and be ready to chase. That is what we have done this year. This playbook has worked well for us. So I anticipate that our 2025 outlook will be for total sales growth of up high single-digits driven by 100 net new stores and comp sales growth of flat to 2%. We would expect some modest operating margin expansion at the high end of this comp range. We will update this initial outlook and share more details in our Q4 call in March. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin. Thank you, Kristin. Before I turn the call over to questions, I would like to emphasize three key points from today's call. Firstly, we feel very good about the underlying comp trend that we achieved in the third quarter. Our comp trend after factoring out cold weather categories was around 4%. This was consistent with our comp trends since March of this year. We're also very pleased with our margin performance in Q3. We achieved 80 basis points of leverage on 1% comp growth. Secondly, we believe that we are well positioned as we enter the key holiday selling period in Q4. We are managing our business cautiously, but based on our underlying sales trend in the third quarter and on the strength of our holiday assortments, we are optimistic about our prospects. Thirdly, we feel very good about the progress we are making towards our longer-term financial goals. We will talk more about this progress in our year-end call in March. But we are especially pleased with our new store opening program. The early performance of our 2024 stores has been strong. And our new store pipeline for 2025 and beyond looks very good. I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Before I answer your question, I would like to make a comment about our cold weather businesses. I realize that in listening to our prepared remarks today, investors might get the mistaken impression that our strong position in cold weather merchandise is somehow a problem. It is absolutely not. The fact that we are one of the first retailers that shoppers think of when they need outerwear is a huge strength for us and a source of competitive advantage. The outerwear business is a great business. We are very good at it, and we will continue to look for ways to build and strengthen that business. But with that said, of course, we know that there will be temperature variations from year to year, especially in a transitional month like October. But those variations tend to even out over time. After an October like the one we've just had, where temperatures were well above the long-term average, the odds are very good that the temperatures next October will be cooler than this year. And that's likely to be a tailwind to our comp in 2025. If that happens, then we'll probably call that out on this call next year. And you can be sure that we will not be complaining about it. The key thing with scold weather categories is to be ready for those fluctuations and to manage the business flexibly so we can react up or down. I should also add that as an off-price retailer, there is a silver lining for us. In years like this, where the season to date has been unusually warm, it's likely that in the coming weeks we will see a lot of terrific buying opportunities in outerwear that we can put into reserve and bring out next year. So, with all that as a preface, let me address your specific question. The 3 points of comp that we discussed in the prepared remarks relate exclusively to the impact of warm temperatures. Separately, we estimate that major hurricanes in Q3 impacted our comp by about an additional point. It's not hard for us to estimate that. We can look at local stores that were affected by the hurricanes. We can quantify the impact on their sales during the hurricane period and during any subsequent power outage. Anyway, the bottom line is, if you strip out the warmer temperatures and the hurricane impact, then our third quarter comp growth would have been 5%. By the way, our rationale for not calling out that hurricane impact in the prepared remarks is that we recognize that that affects all retailers or at least all retailers with a presence in those areas. In contrast, the reason that we called out the warmer temperatures or the impact of warmer temperatures is that for all the reasons we've described, those warmer temperatures at this time of year differentially affect us versus other retail companies. Maybe Just wrapping up, on the last part of your question about weather risk in Q4, of course, there might be unfavorable or favorable weather in Q4. It's hard to predict, but there are a couple of reasons why we're comfortable with that risk. Firstly, as I said in the remarks, the quarter is off to a good start with November month to date running ahead of plan. And secondly, it's important to understand that as we get further into the quarter, cold weather selling becomes less important relative to holiday selling and gift giving. In other words, for the next five, six weeks, the customer could come into the store looking for outerwear, but at this point, they're more likely to be looking for toys or gifts or holiday merchandise. Our early selling in those businesses has been strong, so we are optimistic about Q4. Well, good morning, Ike. Thank you for the question. Yes, as you know, the lower income customer is a very important customer to us. We tend to index much higher among this demographic than our retail peers. We're very focused on offering great value to that customer, and I would say that we're more tuned in now, more tuned in than we ever were before into what is happening with that customer demographic. I can't really comment on what's happening with dollar stores. Their business is so different to ours given their focus on consumables. But instead, let me describe what we are seeing with the data we have around the lower income customer. One of the things that we track very closely is the performance of our stores based on the demographics of their local trade area. So we segment our stores based upon the demographics of the local trade area and we look at their sales trend. Some of our highest volume and most productive stores are in lower income trade areas. And two years ago in 2022, those stores were underperforming the chain. Now, because they are relatively high volume, that had a big impact on our overall comp trend. If I fast forward to today, our stores in lower income trade areas are outperforming the chain based on comments that we've heard from other discretionary retailers that are focused on lower income customers. We think that may be part of a general trend. We think that customer is looking for great value and maybe for the first time since 2021, it looks like their real incomes are finally edging up. I should also add that in that analysis of store performance by trade area demographics, we are seeing healthy performance in other income bands as well. And we see that as evidence that shoppers from moderate to higher income bands may be trading down. But coming back to the lower income customer, as we've discussed previously, that customer really bore the brunt of cost of living increases in 2022. Unlike other income groups, those shoppers don't have savings or debt capacity that they can use to cushion the impact of higher rent or grocery prices. So in 2022, that customer had to pull back sharply on discretionary spending. Over the past year or so what we're seeing is that as their real incomes have stabilized and started to pick back up, they're spending more and we think that's helping to support the strength of our underlying trend. Well, good morning, Lorraine. I think that's what they might call a $64,000 question. The headline, I think, is it's very difficult to predict. If I think about it, there are some policies that I could absolutely imagine might help our business, especially policies that enhance the real incomes or the discretionary spending power of our core customers. For example, lower taxes on overtime pay or on tips or higher child tax credit or policies that bring down the cost of energy. And of course, as a separate item, if corporate taxes are reduced, then that would be very helpful to our business in terms of earnings and cash. We are a domestic US retailer. We don't have foreign subsidiaries. Our earnings are all in the United States. So lower corporate taxes would have a huge impact. Of course, there are also risks and potential headwinds. For example, if inflation were to pick up again or if there were an economic slowdown. And then there are policies such as tariffs or tighter immigration controls or reductions in federal programs where the potential impact, I think, really depends on the scale of the policy. For example, on tariffs, we don't know how significant those will be, what categories they'll apply to, or even which countries. I think we just have to wait and see the details before we make an assessment. But maybe I should just make a general comment. My experience has been that whenever there is significant uncertainty or disruption in the external environment, then while that can be a headwind and a headache for everyone, including us in the short term, the uncertainty and disruption is often very good for off-price retail in the end. The reason why uncertainty disruptions often work out well for off-price is that the off-price business model, when it's well executed, is better able to handle the uncertainty and respond to whatever happens. The implication for us is that we need to execute our business well. In other words, plan conservatively, maintain flexibility, and be ready to react. If we do that, then there may be some bumps along the road, but I believe that things will work out well for us. Thanks, Lorraine. Thanks, John. Well, good morning, John. That's two $64, 000 questions. That's great. The direct answer to your question is that I'm not going anywhere. I'm a young man and I'm not thinking of retirement. I'm 100% committed to Burlington. But maybe I should just take a minute to expand on that answer. In the 2023 to 2028 long-range plan, we've laid out, I think, fairly ambitious growth goals, 500 net new stores, 60% higher sales, and a tripling of operating income. I intend to be around to hit those financial targets. And I should add that those growth numbers are not just -- just the beginning for Burlington. We have potential well beyond 2028. Leaving aside the numbers though, on a personal level, I feel really vested in driving our business to its full potential, and in the specific initiatives that will get us there. And we're doing some tremendously exciting things in merchandising, localization, supply chain, store environment, and with our new store and store relocation programs. And I plan to be right here working with my team to support and help drive those specific programs. So lastly, let me talk about the team. I don't mean to brag, but I genuinely feel like I've assembled the A-Team here at Burlington. Across the company, we've been able to bring in tremendous talent. That's especially true at the senior level. We have a huge amount of off-price experience. But we've also successfully brought in functional and category expertise and experience from other retail environments. Add to that, we have a very strong and experienced base of long-tenured and homegrown Burlington talent. And whenever you put together a new team like that, it can take a little bit of time to gel, but over the past 12 to 18 months, I've seen a real maturation in that group. I think our senior leaders are operating very effectively as a team. Thanks, John. Good morning, Brooke. Thank you for the question. I think I'm going to reframe your question slightly. Rather than just focusing on better brands, I would say that for the last couple of years, we've been working to elevate our assortments and thereby deliver even better value to the customer. Now, in businesses like, say, sportswear or footwear, that means a higher mix of better or recognizable brands. But in other areas like home or juniors, it's more about the quality or the design or the fashion. Now together with price, those are all drivers of value. And the importance of each driver depends on the business and also depends on the customer, which is why our [Technical Difficulty] work very hard to make sure that we're offering great value, but within the context of a good, better, best assortment. Now, as we've discussed before, this isn't a new strategy. When you boil it down, the strategy is and always has been to offer great value to shoppers. Elevating our assortment in terms of brand mix, fashion, design, and quality is more of an evolution rather than a revolution. There's no significant hit to merchant margin here. In fact, as Kristin described in the prepared remarks, in Q3, we achieved an increase in merchant margin driven by lower markdowns and higher markup. Together with our strong underlying sales trend, we see that as evidence that our elevation strategy is working. Well, good morning, Alex. Thank you for the question. I really like this question. Let me talk a little bit about. Well, first of all, there are many important initiatives going on across the company in merchandising, stores, supply chain, real estate and IT. But to answer your question, maybe I should just highlight two specific initiatives that we've recently rolled out and that I expect will have a big impact over time. Firstly, in 2023, we completely refreshed and updated the suite of reports that our merchants use to analyze sales trends. But then, in the first half of this year, so quite recently, we followed that up and rolled out a new in-season trending process. Now that allows merchants and planners to more frequently and rapidly react to what they're seeing in those sales reports. They can re-fork our sales and they can move open to buy dollars into businesses that are trending. And they can pull money out of areas that are not trending. Now, to some degree, of course, they've always been able to do that to some degree. But the new reports are more accurate and up to date, and they provide our merchants with better visibility to support that reporting process. And add to that, the new process enables greater frequency and speed in making those changes. So, I think those improvements were already helping us to more rapidly and effectively chase or pull back based on the trend. Secondly, in the summer, we turned on new store-level sales and allocation algorithms to more effectively respond to trends of the individual store class level and thereby drive greater customization of the assortment by store. Now, those localization algorithms are based on machine learning and over time, they're going to optimize the allocation of receipts based on store class level selling. That'll take some time for that effect to really build, but it should drive stronger sales, faster turns and lower markdowns. I think that the two initiatives I've just described provide a good illustration of what we're trying to do with Burlington 2.0. We know that when it comes to processes, systems, tools, and execution, we're behind our off-price peers. But that's just another way of saying we have huge opportunity and upside. And we're very focused on that upside and on narrowing that gap versus our peers. The two initiatives that I've described, I think, are good examples of how we're going to do that. Well, let me close the call by thanking everyone for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in March to discuss our fourth quarter 2024 fiscal results. I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and thank you for your time today."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to David Glick, Group's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Glick: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's conference call to discuss Burlington's fiscal 2024 second quarter operating results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On this morning's call, we would like to discuss our second quarter results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Then, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let's talk about our Q2 results. I'm going to start with total sales growth. Our total sales in Q2 grew by 13% compared to the second quarter of 2023. That was on top of 9% total sales growth versus the second quarter of 2022. New stores are a key driver of this growth. In Q2, we added 36 net new stores and ended the quarter with 1,057 locations. The other driver of top-line sales is comp sales growth. Comp store sales for the second quarter increased 5% versus our guidance of flat to 2%. This 5% comp sales growth was on top of last year's second quarter comp increase of up 4%. Let me move on now to profitability. In the second quarter, we expanded our operating margin by 160 basis points versus last year's second quarter. In a moment, Kristin will provide more details, but for now, let me call out the two primary drivers of this expansion. Firstly, our gross margin increased by 110 basis points. This was driven by faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Secondly, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage in supply chain, driven by faster-than-expected progress in our supply chain efficiency initiatives. As Kristin will explain, our well-ahead-of-planned sales growth plus healthy margin expansion drove very strong earnings growth in the second quarter. Now, I would like to take a few moments to editorialize on our second quarter performance. Again, I will start with total sales. Of course, we are very happy with 13% total sales growth on top of 9% of total sales growth last year. This means that on a compound basis, our business is 24% bigger now than it was two years ago. Given the volatility and uncertainty of the last couple of years, we are very pleased with this growth. In Q2, we opened 36 net new stores, and we also relocated four of our older oversized locations. This means that for the fiscal year-to-date, we've opened 50 net new stores, plus 15 relocations. And for the year as a whole, we're on track to open 100 net new stores plus approximately 30 relocations. As discussed in the past, on average, we expect our new stores to run at about $7 million in sales in their first full year. I am pleased to say that our new stores are running ahead of this benchmark. We were also pleased with our positive 5% comp growth in Q2. Keep in mind that as we opened new stores, there is some cannibalization headwind on comp stores. Our positive 5% comp sales increase in the second quarter was despite this headwind. Another point to make as I dissect this 5% growth, we continue to see very strong performance in full-price selling. Our merchants are focused on offering really sharp value out of the gate at the initial ticketed price. This is driving faster turns and lower markdowns. This means that there is less inventory making it to the clearance rack. Our comp on clearance sales was down double-digits in Q2. Meanwhile, our comp on full-price selling was positive 7%. This was the driver of our 110 basis points of gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Stepping back a little, I was pleased with our execution in Q2. We have made a lot of changes and improvements to our business over the last few years in merchandising and in operations. We are still in the early innings of many of these programs. And to be clear, we have a long way to go in terms of achieving full potential off-price execution. But we are gaining traction and making some good progress. The other point to make is that over the past 18 months, the external environment has become more favorable. Two years ago, our core low-income customer was under severe economic pressure from the higher cost of living. Since then, it feels as if two things have happened. As inflation has moderated, the situation for lower-income shoppers has somewhat improved. In parallel, economic pressure and uncertainty has spread and broadened well beyond lower-income shoppers. There is now greater focus on value across demographic groups and income bands. This greater focus on value is helping our business. The factors that I have just described provide some grounds for optimism for the back half of the year, but as we've discussed before, our playbook is to manage our business cautiously and be ready to chase. We are maintaining guidance of 0% to 2% comp growth for Q3 and for Q4. Let me comment on each quarter separately. For Q3, there are a couple of reasons to be cautious in planning and guiding comp sales. Last year, we ran 6% comp growth in the third quarter. This was our strongest quarter of the year. Another point to make, and we have discussed this before, comp sales in the first half of Q3 are driven by back-to-school trends, but comp sales in the latter half depend critically on the weather. As the company that used to be known as Burlington Coat Factory, the weather in late September through October can have a huge impact on our Q3 comp growth. If the weather in Q3 is unseasonably warm, it will suppress our comp trend. We hope that our flat to 2% comp guidance in Q3 will turn out to be conservative. If the trend is stronger, then we will chase it. For Q4, we are also maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance. Over the next couple of months, we will monitor the trend and get an early read on the fall season. Depending on this read, we may revisit and adjust our Q4 plan. We will talk more about this on our third quarter call in November. Again, as an off-price retailer, our playbook is to wait, read the trend and then chase. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, to share more details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Kristin?\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results. Total sales grew 13% and comp sales grew 5%, both well above the high end of our second quarter guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points versus last year. The drivers of this margin expansion were higher gross margins, higher-than-planned supply chain savings and leverage on above-planned comp sales. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the second quarter was 42.8%, an increase of 110 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 90-basis point increase in merchandise margins due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Freight expenses leveraged 20 basis points, primarily due to lower freight rates and cost savings initiatives. Product sourcing costs were $192 million versus $183 million in the second quarter of 2023, decreasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was entirely driven by supply chain expense leverage, from continued progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A costs in the second quarter were 10 basis points higher than last year, driven by planned higher investments in store payroll. Q2 adjusted EBIT margin was 4.8%, 160 basis points above last year. We had guided to 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.24. This was a 98% increase over last year and was well above the high end of our guidance range of $0.83 to $0.93. These results and the guidance that we provided exclude approximately $3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were up 4% above 2023. Our reserve inventory was 41% of our total inventory. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $61 million in common stock. At the end of Q2, we had $380 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August of 2025. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year, as well as for the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Based on our strong performance in the second quarter, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2024 guidance for comp sales, total sales, adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted earnings per share as follows. Comparable store sales are now expected to increase 2% to 3%, with total sales to increase 9% to 10% for the full year 2024. This revised full year guidance factors in our year-to-date comp store sales as well as our guidance for comparable store sales to increase 0% to 2% for the balance of fiscal 2024. We now expect our full year adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 50 basis points to 70 basis points. This is up from our most recent guidance for an increase of 40 basis points to 60 basis points and up from our original guidance for an increase of 10 basis points to 50 basis points. This updated margin outlook now translates to an adjusted earnings per share range of $7.66 to $7.96, up from our most recent guidance of $7.35 to $7.75 and up from our original guidance of $7 to $7.60. Included in this updated guidance is an expected ocean freight headwind of approximately $0.10 impacting the back half of the year, which reflects the rapid increase in ocean container rates since we last updated our guidance in late May. For the third quarter, we are guiding to a comp store sales growth of flat to plus 2%, and a total sales increase of 10% to 12%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 60 basis points to up 80 basis points versus Q3 of 2023. This translates to earnings per share guidance for the third quarter of $1.45 to $1.55. We do not expect any incremental expenses associated with the leases we acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond last year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, this outlook implies comp store sales growth of flat to plus 2%, total sales to increase 5% to 7%, EBIT margins to range from a decrease of 80 basis points to a decrease of 50 basis points, and earnings per share in the range of $3.55 to $3.75. Please keep in mind that the 53rd week shift has a significant negative impact on Q4 in terms of total sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share. I will now turn the call back over to Michael.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, Kristin. Let me recap four key points that we've discussed this morning. Firstly, we are pleased with our sales growth in Q2; 13% total sales growth for the quarter, 5% comp sales growth for the quarter. Secondly, we are happy with our Q2 margin and earnings results. These were driven by higher merchandise margins from very strong regular price selling, faster turns and lower markdowns, and also driven by faster-than-expected progress on our supply chain initiatives. Thirdly, we are maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance for the third and fourth quarters. We recognize that given our recent trend, there may be upside in the back half. If the underlying trend is stronger, then we will take it. Finally, we are raising and updating our full year earnings guidance to reflect our strong ahead-of-planned second quarter results. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: Hello, everyone. We are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to call over Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks, and congrats on a really nice quarter.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Boss: So, Michael, maybe to kick-off, near term, could you speak to back-to-school sales trends, maybe just the overall importance to your business? Or how best to think about the impact of back-to-school, what it maybe had on results as you exited the second quarter? And anything you can share on August trends, I think, would be great.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Back-to-school selling is very important to our business at this time of year. And in fact, maybe it would be helpful if I define what back-to-school really means for us. At Burlington, back-to-school categories, of course, include its apparel, accessories and footwear, but they also include juniors and young men's. There are other specific categories within the footwear business. And in addition, there are other areas of the store, especially in accessories and in home where we go after back-to-school and back to campus opportunities. I should also call out that as a company, we index much higher with younger shoppers and young families than many of our competitors. So, the businesses that I've just listed represent a relatively high penetration of our store. Anyway, that all adds up to saying that back-to-school is a very important business driver for us. Now, in terms of timing, back-to-school as an event really starts in early July and then continues through early September. And of course, the timing depends on the region. Now, as an aside, I would say that as part of merchandising 2.0, we have gotten much better at planning and managing the timing of back-to-school receipt flows based on the specific timing of back-to-school in different regions. Anyway, to answer your question, we were very pleased with our back-to-school trends in July. Comp sales growth, the categories that I described a moment ago were stronger than for the rest of the chain. And that helped to support our overall sales trend as we closed out the quarter in July. On the last part of your question, how are things going in August? Our back-to-school categories have continued to perform well. I would say, obviously, we're three-and-a-half weeks in at this point. We're happy with our overall trend. We've made a solid start to Q3. But with that said, let me add just one note of caution. Back-to-school will wind down pretty soon. So, although we're happy with how the quarter started out, it would be unwise just to extrapolate off that solid start.\nMatthew Boss: That's great color. And then maybe just to follow up, Michael, on your mix of better brands initiative. So, you called out earlier this year the potential to increase the mix of better brands as a comp driver. Was this a key driver in second quarter comps? Or how should we think about this as a potential comp driver in the second half of the year?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, again, thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, as we described earlier this year, we do see an opportunity to increase our mix of better brands. And actually, we see an opportunity more generally to elevate our assortments. We've been shifting in that direction for a while now and we've seen good selling on those better brands, and we've seen good selling at higher price points. We believe that increasing the mix of better brands accomplishes two things. Firstly, those brands themselves drive increased trade-down traffic to our stores. Trade-down shoppers are looking for better, more recognizable brands. Secondly though, those brands also help to validate and reinforce the whole store. Even if a shopper does not buy the specific item, the fact that they see the brand, reinforces the off-price value proposition. It provides a halo, if you like, to our business. So, in the coming months, you will see a higher mix of better brands in our runs. That said, I don't want to overstate this opportunity. I see this as an evolution rather than a revolution. Our brands have always been important to us, but our merchants understand that brands are really just one reference point the customer uses to assess value. Quality, fashion and price are also important, and depending on the category, their relative importance can vary a lot. For example, brands are very important in sportswear, but much less important in juniors where the latest styles and fashions are critical. Another point to make is our merchants are very good at building the assortment to offer great value across price points and it's critical in doing that, it's critical to manage brands within the context of our good-better-best assortment strategy. One last point to make on this. Better brands carry a lower markup. As we increase the mix, it puts pressure on gross margin, and that impact is built into our guidance, it hasn't changed since our last call. As Kristin mentioned earlier, we are making a small adjustment to our gross margin guidance for the back half, but that adjustment is related to higher ocean freight rates rather than the mix of better brands.\nMatthew Boss: Best of luck. Congrats again.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning, everyone. I actually have two questions for Kristin. Kristin, first question is on the supply chain. It's encouraging to see another quarter of supply chain leverage in the P&L. Can you maybe walk us through some of the drivers of that leverage, specifically, what kinds of operational improvements have you made? And then, I think one of your peers has actually talked about more automation and technology in their DCs. Just kind of curious, have these types of initiatives also been part of your program? Would love for some more color there.\nKristin Wolfe: Hi, Ike. Sure. Good morning. We continue to be pleased by the faster-than-expected progress we're making in driving productivity gains and cost savings in supply chain. As we shared in the prepared remarks, supply chain leveraged 60 basis points in Q2. And this was despite the start-up of a new distribution center in the second quarter and the receipt shift that we talked about from Q1 into Q2, we referenced this on last quarter's call. We do have a number of productivity initiatives. These are more within the four wall process improvements that streamline our DC operations, reduce touches, reduce steps, reduce time to process and ultimately save labor dollars in the DC, and we're harvesting these savings a little bit faster than we'd originally planned. On previous calls, we had described supply chain productivity improvement as driving potentially 100 basis points of the 400 basis points of margin improvement we laid out last year in our long-range model. And we'll see how the rest of this year plays out, but expect supply chain to continue to drive leverage in the back half. And in getting to the second part of your question, longer term, probably beyond the long-range model we've laid out, we do have an opportunity to drive incremental leverage as we modernize our supply chain with new larger, much more automated DCs that we expect to open. As I mentioned, we recently opened a new DC this year and we have another much larger DC under construction, which we expect to open in 2026. And with these new DCs, we have an opportunity to design DCs for off-price and with much, much more automation. So, as we expand this additional capacity, there also may be an opportunity to go back and look in modernizing some of our existing legacy DC network as well. But again, the benefits of this are longer term, not necessarily baked into the long-range model that we shared. So, the CapEx to support these new DC investments is embedded in our long-range model. And I think you said you had a follow-up for me as well.\nIke Boruchow: Yeah. I was going to switch over to freight, if that's okay. Just elaborate the second half ocean freight headwinds? I think you called out in the prepared remarks. What's driving it? How long, how impactfully negative will that be? And I guess, how does this impact domestic freight if at all? Because I know you talked about ocean, and can you still kind of lever domestic freight in the third and fourth quarter? Is that changing as well?\nKristin Wolfe: Great. Thanks for the question. It's a very good question. So, as I mentioned, we factored in about $0.10 of higher ocean freight in our back half guidance, and this ocean freight negatively impacts merchandise margin. And so, on ocean freight, we do have some contracted capacity at favorable ocean freight rates, but the spot market rate, as you know, increased significantly since we reported in Q1 in May. And we do have some exposure to the spot market even though the majority of our containers are contracted. So, we're hopeful this ocean freight, the spot market is a transitory pressure point and we're starting to see ocean freight spot rates come down modestly. But of course, there are always risks here and this is difficult to predict. And turning to the second part of your question on domestic freight, on the other hand, domestic freight continues to be a source of modest leverage. We saw domestic freight leverage in Q2, as we negotiated favorable rates. Diesel fuel rate has also been slightly favorable here. So, on domestic freight, we expect to continue to see modest leverage in the back half of the year on that.\nIke Boruchow: Got it. Thanks so much.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of the health of the consumer? You talked previously about the potential for trade-down traffic in your stores. Is that what's driving your comp? And any other call-outs in terms of consumer behavior?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Lorraine. Good to hear from you. Thank you for the question. On our last call, back in May, I think I described the external situation and the health of the consumer as being hard to read. At the time, it felt like there were conflicting data, some positive, some negative, on discretionary spending trends. I would say in the last few months it feels to us that the situation has become a lot clearer. In our view, there are really two things going on. Firstly, the economic pressure and uncertainty that was felt by lower-income shoppers starting two years ago has spread to other income bands and other demographic groups. And it feels like that has driven much greater focus on value across the board. And I think that recent earnings reports from other retailers are all pointing in the same direction. Retailers that are offering the best value are winning and driving comp sales. And so, I think a big part of what we're seeing is that value-conscious customer is trading down into our stores. And the second thing that's going on is that the pressure on the lower-income customer hasn't gone away, but it feels to us like it may have moderated. And that low-income shopper is still very fragile, but as inflation has come down, I think their situation has improved somewhat. We see evidence of that in our own data. So, two years ago, our comp sales trend for stores -- for our stores that are in lower-income trade areas was below the rest of the chain. Now, those stores are -- we watch them very closely, they're very important to us. We have a lot of stores in lower-income trade areas, and they tend to be relatively high volume. So, when they're not comping well, we pay a lot of attention. This year, their trend has improved and is actually running in line with the chain. So, up mid-single digit comp in Q2. And that data point suggests to us that the lower-income customer is at least starting to recover. So, let me recap and also add a note of caution. To recap, we're seeing some positive signs for our business with customer -- with consumers in general being more focused on value and the lower-income shopper in particular starting to recover from the spike of inflation in 2022 and 2023. But my note of caution is that there are a lot of factors of risk that could affect consumer behavior in the back half of 2024 and certainly into next year. So, to sum up, we feel good about our business, but it makes sense to be a little cautious.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thanks. And, Michael, my follow-up question is about the second quarter. Just curious if there were any unusual tailwinds to the comp trends that might not carry over into the fall.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Yeah, it's a good question. I think the only thing like that I would point to was weather in Q2. I know the rule among retailers is that we only mention weather when it's unfavorable, but I'm going to violate that rule and say that I think the weather has probably helped most apparel retailers in Q2. In May and June, temperatures across the United States warmer than last year. And I suspect that most apparel retailers benefited from that in their seasonal businesses, especially in categories like shorts, short-sleeve tops, sandals and swimwear. I would estimate that this strong seasonal performance was worth 1 point to 2 points of comp to us for the quarter. And again, to be clear, that benefit cannot have been unique to us. It must have affected other retailers as well. So, your question was about specific drivers that might not carry over to the fall season. Apart from weather, there were no other factors or tailwinds that I would describe that way. There were no other factors or tailwinds that were unique to the second quarter. Now, of course, it is possible that the weather will be favorable in the fall if temperatures are unseasonably cold. But I guess other than the Farmers' Almanac, we have no visibility into that at this point.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks, Lorraine.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: Good morning. Congrats on the momentum. Couple of questions here. Kristin, first one on your back half earnings guidance. Looks like there's margin improvement year-over-year in Q3, quite a bit of it, but margin deterioration in Q4 year-over-year. Can you walk us through the factors that are driving this? I would assume the 53rd week has an impact, but how do we think about gross margin and SG&A profile in Q3 and Q4?\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. It's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. There're really four primary factors that impact our back half margin outlook. So, I'll kind of dissect each of these. First, as you alluded to, Q3 and Q4 have very different total sales growth plans due to the way the 53rd week calendar impacts, as well as the timing of new store openings this year as compared to last year. So, let me clarify the 53rd week. I'm not referring to the extra week, but actually how the calendar shifts. So, we're about one week ahead of last year when comparing the quarters year-over-year. Now, for comp store sales, we adjust for this, and we line up the week. But for total sales growth, there is an impact on sales and earnings in the quarter. So, this 53rd week shift means that in Q4, we lose a high-volume week in November, and we gain or pick up a low-volume week in January. So, this translates into lower total sales growth in Q4 versus last year, resulting in guidance for the fourth quarter for total sales to grow 5% to 7%. Now, on the -- for the third quarter, we're guiding 10% to 12% total sales increase. Q3 is actually boosted by the 53rd week calendar shift and also benefits from an increased number of new store openings in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. So that difference in total sales growth driven by the calendar shift and new store opening timing really impacts the expansion and the leverage in Q3 favorably and then unfavorably in the fourth quarter. That's really the primary difference between the -- between Q3 and Q4. But as I mentioned, I said there were four factors. The other three are headwinds to the fall, so headwinds to the back half. First, our back half comp guidance is a conservative flat to plus 2%. This is below, obviously, our year-to-date comp trend provides less leverage on fixed expenses. And then secondly, in the back half, on the gross margin side, we do not expect to see the same benefit from lower clearance levels like we saw in the first half of this year. This means we have a lot less merchandise margin expansion opportunity in the back half relative to the first half of this year. And then lastly, the higher ocean freight that we detailed in the prepared remarks and in the earlier question, that's about $0.10 or $9 million of pre-tax. That represents about 20 basis points of merch margin headwind in the back half. And I want to add that the only change to our previous back half guidance is that $0.10 negative impact from ocean freight. So those are really the key factors impacting Q3 and Q4 margin guidance.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. That's very helpful for the model. David or Kristin, just as it relates to the balance sheet, cash flow and share repurchases, you've given guidance for CapEx to be elevated in the next few years. I'm assuming around the 7% of sales level as you fund the unit growth, but how should we think about share repurchases and potential impact on the balance sheet? What's the optimal level of cash in the balance sheet?\nDavid Glick: Sure. I'll take that, John. Thanks for the question. We're still working through our budget for next year. So, it's a little early to be sharing specifics on that. But philosophically, our goal is to return capital to shareholders on a consistent and opportunistic basis through buybacks. And I think outside of the pandemic years, we have a pretty consistent track record of doing so. And as we've shared with you all previously, the first few years of the five-year plan that we shared does have elevated CapEx at about 7% of sales. As you know, this year, we're guiding the $750 million in CapEx. It's still early, but I think you should probably anticipate in that 7% ballpark of sales next year for CapEx. And then, toward the back half or the last three years of that five-year plan, CapEx should average in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of sales. And just kind of as a reminder, why we're stepping up CapEx this year and next year, we're opening a lot more stores. We're at net 80 in 2023 and this year's net 100. Also, we have more closures and relo. So, the gross number of new stores is higher than prior years. In addition, Kristin referenced this in an earlier answer to a question, we've signed a lease on a 2-million square foot DC in the Southeast, that's 2x our largest existing DC. And the CapEx required for that building will peak this year and next year. And we have included in that agreement a purchase option next year for the land and the buildings. We view our DCs as strategic infrastructure that we want to have more control relative to leasing. So, we've included in that sort of high-level outlook for CapEx next year. We've assumed that we would exercise the option to purchase the land and buildings for that DC in the Southeast. And also, as Kristin mentioned earlier, those are much larger and more automated DCs and therefore require more capital investment. So, I know that's a long prelude to actually answering your question. We think our conservative leverage ratios and cash flows and kind of a similar liquidity -- you asked about cash, similar liquidity levels we've had ending the last few years, we feel very comfortable with that. We also feel like we have sufficient cash flow to not only invest in our growth, but to return capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks. And I think you should probably expect kind of a similar pace next year to the pace that you've seen in 2023 and 2024.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. Michael, can you speak to the performance trends that you saw by merchandise category in the second quarter?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Sure. Well, good morning, Brooke. On category performance, the strength, I would say was fairly broad-based across the quarter. Our comp growth in both apparel and in home was in line with the overall chain, so mid-single digit. And other than that, the only other call-outs were that we saw strong sales trends in our seasonal classifications. I kind of referenced that earlier when I was talking about the weather. We also saw strong sales trends in our back-to-school business in July. And then again throughout the quarter, we saw strong sales trends in beauty and in accessories.\nBrooke Roach: Great. And then, as a follow-up, Kristin, can you elaborate on the drivers of the comp growth? How did trends fare by geography? And what trends did you see regarding traffic and basket?\nKristin Wolfe: Sure. Good morning, Brooke. From a geographic or regional perspective, the comp strength was really broad-based. All regions comp positively. Looking at the top-performing regions, that was the Southwest and the Northeast in the quarter. And then, you asked about the drivers of comp growth. Q2 comp was entirely driven by higher transactions as both higher traffic and conversion, both were higher. Our average basket was flattish, slightly higher AUR, offset by slightly lower units per transaction.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Brooke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAlex Straton: Perfect. Thanks so much for taking the question. I've got one for Michael, and then one for Kristin. So maybe just for Michael, I think other retailers have talked about attracting younger shoppers. And I think in a prior answer, you mentioned that Burlington over-indexes to this demo compared to peers. So maybe can you elaborate like what tells you that? And can you talk about this opportunity generally as well as what you guys are doing to successfully attract the shopper?\nMichael O'Sullivan: Well, good morning, Alex. Thanks for the question. Yes, at Burlington, we've always had a stronger position with younger customers and young families, stronger than most of our competitors. And we see that in our customer research. We also see it in our mix of businesses. So -- and I would say, we regard younger shoppers and young families as a core customer group for us. When you walk into our stores, you can kind of see it physically. We have a stronger presentation, I would say, and certainly a greater penetration of juniors, young men's, kids' apparel, kids' accessories, kids' footwear, again, than most of our competitors. Moving on to the part of your question about what are we doing to attract those customers, well, even though that customer segment is a strength for us, we absolutely do not take them for granted. We know that young shoppers and young families are really going to be important to us as we drive growth over the next several years. And we also know that they are financially stretched, so they need value. Our merchants are very focused on providing great value for those customers, offering a combination of fashion, quality, brands at great prices within a good-better-best assortment. I also -- I talked earlier about the strength that we've seen in back-to-school and back-to-campus businesses in the last couple of months. So, overall, I feel pretty good about the success we're having and about the strong trends that we're seeing with that customer group.\nAlex Straton: Great. That's super helpful. Maybe for Kristin, super helpful comments in an earlier question on the puts and takes on the back half broadly by major line items. I'm just wondering how has that changed or has anything changed meaningfully compared to your view three months ago? It seems like sales hasn't, but maybe back half EPS is a little bit lower. So, just trying to understand those dynamics and what's driving that. Thanks a lot.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning, Alex. Yeah, thank you. So, kind of to answer the last part of your question first, the only thing that's changed in our back half guidance is the additional ocean freight headwind that we spoke to, but it's worth reinforcing the -- that 53rd week and the higher sales increase in Q3 versus Q4 really drives a lot more leverage on SG&A and fixed costs in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So there's a big difference there. Gross margin is a more difficult comparison in the fall versus the spring. Again, this is not changed from three months ago, but we do not have the same opportunity with lower clearance levels that we saw in spring. And then, what has changed is the ocean freight headwind. If I -- just going down the P&L in the back half, we do expect some modest leverage in supply chain continued in the back half, probably more in Q3 than in Q4. And given the flat to 2% comp guidance, we'll have some slight deleverage in SG&A and depreciation there from that.\nAlex Straton: Thanks a lot. Good luck, guys.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Alex.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Thank you very much. Really nicely and well done. So, congratulations to everybody at the team at the firm. Kristin, I guess my question is two-fold on inventory. So I'm going to ask, comp inventories are up for the first time in, say, four consecutive quarters. So, relative to the forward comp guidance, can you just kind of reconcile the up in -- up 4% comp inventory against the comp guidance for the third quarter? But on the other hand, the total sales are up 13%, so it looks like you're actually a little light on inventory. So, can you just help us kind of think about those two different pieces of it? And then secondly, I guess also for Kristin, 2025 and '27 convertible notes are now in the money. Can you help us with the accounting treatment of these and the dilutive impact on EPS? Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Great. Good morning, Adrienne. Appreciate the question. On -- I'll start with inventory. So, you kind of -- and your question tied it to the comp growth. I'm going to muddy the water even a bit more, because at the end of Q2, comp store inventories were up 4% versus last year. Again, that's a point in time snapshot that's a little bit deceiving. First, that 53rd week calendar shift changes the comparison point. So, once you adjust for this, it reduces that 4% increase in comp store inventory down to a 2% increase. And then secondly, if I look at the quarter, Q2 as a whole, on average during the quarter, comp store inventories were down 5% to 6% across stores across the second quarter. So, the reason for that point in time difference versus the average is that we were really building our July back-to-school receipts versus last year and really trying to drive back-to-school readiness. So that was kind of the driver of that increase as opposed to the sales trend. We're still seeing -- we saw a much faster turn in Q2, so opportunity with leaner inventory levels. And over the medium term, we still think there's opportunity to manage store inventories lower and to continue to drive a faster turn, but given the progress we've made so far on that front, the pacing is much more modest. And then on the converts, I'm going to turn it over to David or Daniel.\nDavid Glick: Daniel, why don't you take that one?\nDaniel Delrosario: Yeah. Hey, Adrienne, it's Daniel. So, on the converts, we use the if-converted method of accounting, and that means that we assume the principal is paid in cash and that any amount above par is settled in stock. So, from a quarter-to-quarter share count perspective, if the converts are in the money, which both the '25s and '27s are, and as a reminder, the strike on the '25s is $220 and the strike on our 2027s is $206, will include any dilution in the share count. So, to answer your question, for the second quarter, the converts added about 163,000 shares to our diluted share count. So, just to round out my answer, so obviously, the 2025s mature in April next year, at which point in time will net share settle, meaning that we'll pay the [$156 million] (ph) principal in cash and then we'll issue any additional shares to cover the premium if there is one. So, as David mentioned earlier, we've been consistently buying back stock. So, we'd expect to continue to do so and be able to mitigate any potential dilution at that time. I mean, you'll know, for example, this quarter, we repurchased about 270,000 shares. So, we more than offset the dilution from the converts.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Hi, good morning, everyone, and nice to see the results. I have one for Michael and Kristin. Michael, how do you think about the potential for international expansion and what the opportunity could look like? And then, Kristin, in terms of labor availability and wage rates, what are you seeing there along with the investment that you've been making in store payroll relative to deleverage? Thank you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Good morning, Dana. And thank you for the question. So, on international expansion, I guess, let me start by saying that I believe that the off-price retail model has huge potential and application. In a number of overseas markets, I'm -- my belief is that everyone everywhere in every country loves the deal, loves a great deal. So, I think it makes a lot of sense for our larger off-price peers to expand their international footprint. They have the know-how and the resources to go after those overseas opportunities. And if and when those competitors run out of expansion opportunities in the United States, they can use those overseas investments to drive continued growth and shareholder value. So that makes sense. But the reality is that we at Burlington, I would say, are in a very, very different boat. We barely have 1,000 stores in the United States. Our peers have two to three times that number. So, we still have huge potential to expand right here in the USA. So, for us, that's job number one, job number two and job number three. One day, maybe it will make sense for us to divert resources to an international opportunity. But right now, and I would say for the foreseeable future, our complete focus and our resources have to be on the full potential and driving the full potential of our core US business.\nKristin Wolfe: Great. And then, Dana, on your second question around store labor and wage rates, as well as investments in store payroll, so first on wage rates, we've certainly absorbed meaningful wage rate increases over the last few years, particularly in DCs, but also in stores. In terms of distribution centers, we're comfortable with where we are. They are located in very competitive labor markets for DC workers in New Jersey and California and our wages are appropriate and competitive. And for stores, our philosophy has been and remains to be to approach wages on a market-by-market basis. So, we build in incremental dollars, obviously, to cover legislative wage increases, but also competitive wage increases in select markets, and this is how we address this. And then, on the investment in terms of store payroll, you may recall that in the third quarter of 2023, we made a deliberate investment in store payroll to improve service levels and improve store conditions. We're pleased with that investment and those results as we've seen improvement in customer service scores. So, from a financial impact standpoint, we'll have fully lapped this investment in the third quarter.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks, Dana.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. O'Sullivan, I turn the call back over to you.\nMichael O'Sullivan: Thank you. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in November to discuss our third quarter 2024 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today, and please enjoy the holiday weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results. Total sales grew 13% and comp sales grew 5%, both well above the high end of our second quarter guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points versus last year. The drivers of this margin expansion were higher gross margins, higher-than-planned supply chain savings and leverage on above-planned comp sales. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the second quarter was 42.8%, an increase of 110 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 90-basis point increase in merchandise margins due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Freight expenses leveraged 20 basis points, primarily due to lower freight rates and cost savings initiatives. Product sourcing costs were $192 million versus $183 million in the second quarter of 2023, decreasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. This was entirely driven by supply chain expense leverage, from continued progress on our distribution center productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A costs in the second quarter were 10 basis points higher than last year, driven by planned higher investments in store payroll. Q2 adjusted EBIT margin was 4.8%, 160 basis points above last year. We had guided to 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement. Our adjusted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.24. This was a 98% increase over last year and was well above the high end of our guidance range of $0.83 to $0.93. These results and the guidance that we provided exclude approximately $3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were up 4% above 2023. Our reserve inventory was 41% of our total inventory. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $61 million in common stock. At the end of Q2, we had $380 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August of 2025. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year, as well as for the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Based on our strong performance in the second quarter, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2024 guidance for comp sales, total sales, adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted earnings per share as follows. Comparable store sales are now expected to increase 2% to 3%, with total sales to increase 9% to 10% for the full year 2024. This revised full year guidance factors in our year-to-date comp store sales as well as our guidance for comparable store sales to increase 0% to 2% for the balance of fiscal 2024. We now expect our full year adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 50 basis points to 70 basis points. This is up from our most recent guidance for an increase of 40 basis points to 60 basis points and up from our original guidance for an increase of 10 basis points to 50 basis points. This updated margin outlook now translates to an adjusted earnings per share range of $7.66 to $7.96, up from our most recent guidance of $7.35 to $7.75 and up from our original guidance of $7 to $7.60. Included in this updated guidance is an expected ocean freight headwind of approximately $0.10 impacting the back half of the year, which reflects the rapid increase in ocean container rates since we last updated our guidance in late May. For the third quarter, we are guiding to a comp store sales growth of flat to plus 2%, and a total sales increase of 10% to 12%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 60 basis points to up 80 basis points versus Q3 of 2023. This translates to earnings per share guidance for the third quarter of $1.45 to $1.55. We do not expect any incremental expenses associated with the leases we acquired from Bed Bath & Beyond last year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, this outlook implies comp store sales growth of flat to plus 2%, total sales to increase 5% to 7%, EBIT margins to range from a decrease of 80 basis points to a decrease of 50 basis points, and earnings per share in the range of $3.55 to $3.75. Please keep in mind that the 53rd week shift has a significant negative impact on Q4 in terms of total sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share. I will now turn the call back over to Michael. Hi, Ike. Sure. Good morning. We continue to be pleased by the faster-than-expected progress we're making in driving productivity gains and cost savings in supply chain. As we shared in the prepared remarks, supply chain leveraged 60 basis points in Q2. And this was despite the start-up of a new distribution center in the second quarter and the receipt shift that we talked about from Q1 into Q2, we referenced this on last quarter's call. We do have a number of productivity initiatives. These are more within the four wall process improvements that streamline our DC operations, reduce touches, reduce steps, reduce time to process and ultimately save labor dollars in the DC, and we're harvesting these savings a little bit faster than we'd originally planned. On previous calls, we had described supply chain productivity improvement as driving potentially 100 basis points of the 400 basis points of margin improvement we laid out last year in our long-range model. And we'll see how the rest of this year plays out, but expect supply chain to continue to drive leverage in the back half. And in getting to the second part of your question, longer term, probably beyond the long-range model we've laid out, we do have an opportunity to drive incremental leverage as we modernize our supply chain with new larger, much more automated DCs that we expect to open. As I mentioned, we recently opened a new DC this year and we have another much larger DC under construction, which we expect to open in 2026. And with these new DCs, we have an opportunity to design DCs for off-price and with much, much more automation. So, as we expand this additional capacity, there also may be an opportunity to go back and look in modernizing some of our existing legacy DC network as well. But again, the benefits of this are longer term, not necessarily baked into the long-range model that we shared. So, the CapEx to support these new DC investments is embedded in our long-range model. And I think you said you had a follow-up for me as well. Great. Thanks for the question. It's a very good question. So, as I mentioned, we factored in about $0.10 of higher ocean freight in our back half guidance, and this ocean freight negatively impacts merchandise margin. And so, on ocean freight, we do have some contracted capacity at favorable ocean freight rates, but the spot market rate, as you know, increased significantly since we reported in Q1 in May. And we do have some exposure to the spot market even though the majority of our containers are contracted. So, we're hopeful this ocean freight, the spot market is a transitory pressure point and we're starting to see ocean freight spot rates come down modestly. But of course, there are always risks here and this is difficult to predict. And turning to the second part of your question on domestic freight, on the other hand, domestic freight continues to be a source of modest leverage. We saw domestic freight leverage in Q2, as we negotiated favorable rates. Diesel fuel rate has also been slightly favorable here. So, on domestic freight, we expect to continue to see modest leverage in the back half of the year on that. Thanks, Ike. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. It's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. There're really four primary factors that impact our back half margin outlook. So, I'll kind of dissect each of these. First, as you alluded to, Q3 and Q4 have very different total sales growth plans due to the way the 53rd week calendar impacts, as well as the timing of new store openings this year as compared to last year. So, let me clarify the 53rd week. I'm not referring to the extra week, but actually how the calendar shifts. So, we're about one week ahead of last year when comparing the quarters year-over-year. Now, for comp store sales, we adjust for this, and we line up the week. But for total sales growth, there is an impact on sales and earnings in the quarter. So, this 53rd week shift means that in Q4, we lose a high-volume week in November, and we gain or pick up a low-volume week in January. So, this translates into lower total sales growth in Q4 versus last year, resulting in guidance for the fourth quarter for total sales to grow 5% to 7%. Now, on the -- for the third quarter, we're guiding 10% to 12% total sales increase. Q3 is actually boosted by the 53rd week calendar shift and also benefits from an increased number of new store openings in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. So that difference in total sales growth driven by the calendar shift and new store opening timing really impacts the expansion and the leverage in Q3 favorably and then unfavorably in the fourth quarter. That's really the primary difference between the -- between Q3 and Q4. But as I mentioned, I said there were four factors. The other three are headwinds to the fall, so headwinds to the back half. First, our back half comp guidance is a conservative flat to plus 2%. This is below, obviously, our year-to-date comp trend provides less leverage on fixed expenses. And then secondly, in the back half, on the gross margin side, we do not expect to see the same benefit from lower clearance levels like we saw in the first half of this year. This means we have a lot less merchandise margin expansion opportunity in the back half relative to the first half of this year. And then lastly, the higher ocean freight that we detailed in the prepared remarks and in the earlier question, that's about $0.10 or $9 million of pre-tax. That represents about 20 basis points of merch margin headwind in the back half. And I want to add that the only change to our previous back half guidance is that $0.10 negative impact from ocean freight. So those are really the key factors impacting Q3 and Q4 margin guidance. Sure. Good morning, Brooke. From a geographic or regional perspective, the comp strength was really broad-based. All regions comp positively. Looking at the top-performing regions, that was the Southwest and the Northeast in the quarter. And then, you asked about the drivers of comp growth. Q2 comp was entirely driven by higher transactions as both higher traffic and conversion, both were higher. Our average basket was flattish, slightly higher AUR, offset by slightly lower units per transaction. Thanks, Brooke. Good morning, Alex. Yeah, thank you. So, kind of to answer the last part of your question first, the only thing that's changed in our back half guidance is the additional ocean freight headwind that we spoke to, but it's worth reinforcing the -- that 53rd week and the higher sales increase in Q3 versus Q4 really drives a lot more leverage on SG&A and fixed costs in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So there's a big difference there. Gross margin is a more difficult comparison in the fall versus the spring. Again, this is not changed from three months ago, but we do not have the same opportunity with lower clearance levels that we saw in spring. And then, what has changed is the ocean freight headwind. If I -- just going down the P&L in the back half, we do expect some modest leverage in supply chain continued in the back half, probably more in Q3 than in Q4. And given the flat to 2% comp guidance, we'll have some slight deleverage in SG&A and depreciation there from that. Thanks, Alex. Great. Good morning, Adrienne. Appreciate the question. On -- I'll start with inventory. So, you kind of -- and your question tied it to the comp growth. I'm going to muddy the water even a bit more, because at the end of Q2, comp store inventories were up 4% versus last year. Again, that's a point in time snapshot that's a little bit deceiving. First, that 53rd week calendar shift changes the comparison point. So, once you adjust for this, it reduces that 4% increase in comp store inventory down to a 2% increase. And then secondly, if I look at the quarter, Q2 as a whole, on average during the quarter, comp store inventories were down 5% to 6% across stores across the second quarter. So, the reason for that point in time difference versus the average is that we were really building our July back-to-school receipts versus last year and really trying to drive back-to-school readiness. So that was kind of the driver of that increase as opposed to the sales trend. We're still seeing -- we saw a much faster turn in Q2, so opportunity with leaner inventory levels. And over the medium term, we still think there's opportunity to manage store inventories lower and to continue to drive a faster turn, but given the progress we've made so far on that front, the pacing is much more modest. And then on the converts, I'm going to turn it over to David or Daniel. Great. And then, Dana, on your second question around store labor and wage rates, as well as investments in store payroll, so first on wage rates, we've certainly absorbed meaningful wage rate increases over the last few years, particularly in DCs, but also in stores. In terms of distribution centers, we're comfortable with where we are. They are located in very competitive labor markets for DC workers in New Jersey and California and our wages are appropriate and competitive. And for stores, our philosophy has been and remains to be to approach wages on a market-by-market basis. So, we build in incremental dollars, obviously, to cover legislative wage increases, but also competitive wage increases in select markets, and this is how we address this. And then, on the investment in terms of store payroll, you may recall that in the third quarter of 2023, we made a deliberate investment in store payroll to improve service levels and improve store conditions. We're pleased with that investment and those results as we've seen improvement in customer service scores. So, from a financial impact standpoint, we'll have fully lapped this investment in the third quarter. Thanks, Dana."

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On this morning's call, we would like to discuss our second quarter results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Then, we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay. Let's talk about our Q2 results. I'm going to start with total sales growth. Our total sales in Q2 grew by 13% compared to the second quarter of 2023. That was on top of 9% total sales growth versus the second quarter of 2022. New stores are a key driver of this growth. In Q2, we added 36 net new stores and ended the quarter with 1,057 locations. The other driver of top-line sales is comp sales growth. Comp store sales for the second quarter increased 5% versus our guidance of flat to 2%. This 5% comp sales growth was on top of last year's second quarter comp increase of up 4%. Let me move on now to profitability. In the second quarter, we expanded our operating margin by 160 basis points versus last year's second quarter. In a moment, Kristin will provide more details, but for now, let me call out the two primary drivers of this expansion. Firstly, our gross margin increased by 110 basis points. This was driven by faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Secondly, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage in supply chain, driven by faster-than-expected progress in our supply chain efficiency initiatives. As Kristin will explain, our well-ahead-of-planned sales growth plus healthy margin expansion drove very strong earnings growth in the second quarter. Now, I would like to take a few moments to editorialize on our second quarter performance. Again, I will start with total sales. Of course, we are very happy with 13% total sales growth on top of 9% of total sales growth last year. This means that on a compound basis, our business is 24% bigger now than it was two years ago. Given the volatility and uncertainty of the last couple of years, we are very pleased with this growth. In Q2, we opened 36 net new stores, and we also relocated four of our older oversized locations. This means that for the fiscal year-to-date, we've opened 50 net new stores, plus 15 relocations. And for the year as a whole, we're on track to open 100 net new stores plus approximately 30 relocations. As discussed in the past, on average, we expect our new stores to run at about $7 million in sales in their first full year. I am pleased to say that our new stores are running ahead of this benchmark. We were also pleased with our positive 5% comp growth in Q2. Keep in mind that as we opened new stores, there is some cannibalization headwind on comp stores. Our positive 5% comp sales increase in the second quarter was despite this headwind. Another point to make as I dissect this 5% growth, we continue to see very strong performance in full-price selling. Our merchants are focused on offering really sharp value out of the gate at the initial ticketed price. This is driving faster turns and lower markdowns. This means that there is less inventory making it to the clearance rack. Our comp on clearance sales was down double-digits in Q2. Meanwhile, our comp on full-price selling was positive 7%. This was the driver of our 110 basis points of gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Stepping back a little, I was pleased with our execution in Q2. We have made a lot of changes and improvements to our business over the last few years in merchandising and in operations. We are still in the early innings of many of these programs. And to be clear, we have a long way to go in terms of achieving full potential off-price execution. But we are gaining traction and making some good progress. The other point to make is that over the past 18 months, the external environment has become more favorable. Two years ago, our core low-income customer was under severe economic pressure from the higher cost of living. Since then, it feels as if two things have happened. As inflation has moderated, the situation for lower-income shoppers has somewhat improved. In parallel, economic pressure and uncertainty has spread and broadened well beyond lower-income shoppers. There is now greater focus on value across demographic groups and income bands. This greater focus on value is helping our business. The factors that I have just described provide some grounds for optimism for the back half of the year, but as we've discussed before, our playbook is to manage our business cautiously and be ready to chase. We are maintaining guidance of 0% to 2% comp growth for Q3 and for Q4. Let me comment on each quarter separately. For Q3, there are a couple of reasons to be cautious in planning and guiding comp sales. Last year, we ran 6% comp growth in the third quarter. This was our strongest quarter of the year. Another point to make, and we have discussed this before, comp sales in the first half of Q3 are driven by back-to-school trends, but comp sales in the latter half depend critically on the weather. As the company that used to be known as Burlington Coat Factory, the weather in late September through October can have a huge impact on our Q3 comp growth. If the weather in Q3 is unseasonably warm, it will suppress our comp trend. We hope that our flat to 2% comp guidance in Q3 will turn out to be conservative. If the trend is stronger, then we will chase it. For Q4, we are also maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance. Over the next couple of months, we will monitor the trend and get an early read on the fall season. Depending on this read, we may revisit and adjust our Q4 plan. We will talk more about this on our third quarter call in November. Again, as an off-price retailer, our playbook is to wait, read the trend and then chase. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, to share more details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Kristin? Thank you, Kristin. Let me recap four key points that we've discussed this morning. Firstly, we are pleased with our sales growth in Q2; 13% total sales growth for the quarter, 5% comp sales growth for the quarter. Secondly, we are happy with our Q2 margin and earnings results. These were driven by higher merchandise margins from very strong regular price selling, faster turns and lower markdowns, and also driven by faster-than-expected progress on our supply chain initiatives. Thirdly, we are maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance for the third and fourth quarters. We recognize that given our recent trend, there may be upside in the back half. If the underlying trend is stronger, then we will take it. Finally, we are raising and updating our full year earnings guidance to reflect our strong ahead-of-planned second quarter results. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Thanks, Matt. Well, good morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Back-to-school selling is very important to our business at this time of year. And in fact, maybe it would be helpful if I define what back-to-school really means for us. At Burlington, back-to-school categories, of course, include its apparel, accessories and footwear, but they also include juniors and young men's. There are other specific categories within the footwear business. And in addition, there are other areas of the store, especially in accessories and in home where we go after back-to-school and back to campus opportunities. I should also call out that as a company, we index much higher with younger shoppers and young families than many of our competitors. So, the businesses that I've just listed represent a relatively high penetration of our store. Anyway, that all adds up to saying that back-to-school is a very important business driver for us. Now, in terms of timing, back-to-school as an event really starts in early July and then continues through early September. And of course, the timing depends on the region. Now, as an aside, I would say that as part of merchandising 2.0, we have gotten much better at planning and managing the timing of back-to-school receipt flows based on the specific timing of back-to-school in different regions. Anyway, to answer your question, we were very pleased with our back-to-school trends in July. Comp sales growth, the categories that I described a moment ago were stronger than for the rest of the chain. And that helped to support our overall sales trend as we closed out the quarter in July. On the last part of your question, how are things going in August? Our back-to-school categories have continued to perform well. I would say, obviously, we're three-and-a-half weeks in at this point. We're happy with our overall trend. We've made a solid start to Q3. But with that said, let me add just one note of caution. Back-to-school will wind down pretty soon. So, although we're happy with how the quarter started out, it would be unwise just to extrapolate off that solid start. Well, again, thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, as we described earlier this year, we do see an opportunity to increase our mix of better brands. And actually, we see an opportunity more generally to elevate our assortments. We've been shifting in that direction for a while now and we've seen good selling on those better brands, and we've seen good selling at higher price points. We believe that increasing the mix of better brands accomplishes two things. Firstly, those brands themselves drive increased trade-down traffic to our stores. Trade-down shoppers are looking for better, more recognizable brands. Secondly though, those brands also help to validate and reinforce the whole store. Even if a shopper does not buy the specific item, the fact that they see the brand, reinforces the off-price value proposition. It provides a halo, if you like, to our business. So, in the coming months, you will see a higher mix of better brands in our runs. That said, I don't want to overstate this opportunity. I see this as an evolution rather than a revolution. Our brands have always been important to us, but our merchants understand that brands are really just one reference point the customer uses to assess value. Quality, fashion and price are also important, and depending on the category, their relative importance can vary a lot. For example, brands are very important in sportswear, but much less important in juniors where the latest styles and fashions are critical. Another point to make is our merchants are very good at building the assortment to offer great value across price points and it's critical in doing that, it's critical to manage brands within the context of our good-better-best assortment strategy. One last point to make on this. Better brands carry a lower markup. As we increase the mix, it puts pressure on gross margin, and that impact is built into our guidance, it hasn't changed since our last call. As Kristin mentioned earlier, we are making a small adjustment to our gross margin guidance for the back half, but that adjustment is related to higher ocean freight rates rather than the mix of better brands. Thank you, Matt. Well, good morning, Lorraine. Good to hear from you. Thank you for the question. On our last call, back in May, I think I described the external situation and the health of the consumer as being hard to read. At the time, it felt like there were conflicting data, some positive, some negative, on discretionary spending trends. I would say in the last few months it feels to us that the situation has become a lot clearer. In our view, there are really two things going on. Firstly, the economic pressure and uncertainty that was felt by lower-income shoppers starting two years ago has spread to other income bands and other demographic groups. And it feels like that has driven much greater focus on value across the board. And I think that recent earnings reports from other retailers are all pointing in the same direction. Retailers that are offering the best value are winning and driving comp sales. And so, I think a big part of what we're seeing is that value-conscious customer is trading down into our stores. And the second thing that's going on is that the pressure on the lower-income customer hasn't gone away, but it feels to us like it may have moderated. And that low-income shopper is still very fragile, but as inflation has come down, I think their situation has improved somewhat. We see evidence of that in our own data. So, two years ago, our comp sales trend for stores -- for our stores that are in lower-income trade areas was below the rest of the chain. Now, those stores are -- we watch them very closely, they're very important to us. We have a lot of stores in lower-income trade areas, and they tend to be relatively high volume. So, when they're not comping well, we pay a lot of attention. This year, their trend has improved and is actually running in line with the chain. So, up mid-single digit comp in Q2. And that data point suggests to us that the lower-income customer is at least starting to recover. So, let me recap and also add a note of caution. To recap, we're seeing some positive signs for our business with customer -- with consumers in general being more focused on value and the lower-income shopper in particular starting to recover from the spike of inflation in 2022 and 2023. But my note of caution is that there are a lot of factors of risk that could affect consumer behavior in the back half of 2024 and certainly into next year. So, to sum up, we feel good about our business, but it makes sense to be a little cautious. Yeah, it's a good question. I think the only thing like that I would point to was weather in Q2. I know the rule among retailers is that we only mention weather when it's unfavorable, but I'm going to violate that rule and say that I think the weather has probably helped most apparel retailers in Q2. In May and June, temperatures across the United States warmer than last year. And I suspect that most apparel retailers benefited from that in their seasonal businesses, especially in categories like shorts, short-sleeve tops, sandals and swimwear. I would estimate that this strong seasonal performance was worth 1 point to 2 points of comp to us for the quarter. And again, to be clear, that benefit cannot have been unique to us. It must have affected other retailers as well. So, your question was about specific drivers that might not carry over to the fall season. Apart from weather, there were no other factors or tailwinds that I would describe that way. There were no other factors or tailwinds that were unique to the second quarter. Now, of course, it is possible that the weather will be favorable in the fall if temperatures are unseasonably cold. But I guess other than the Farmers' Almanac, we have no visibility into that at this point. Thanks, Lorraine. Sure. Well, good morning, Brooke. On category performance, the strength, I would say was fairly broad-based across the quarter. Our comp growth in both apparel and in home was in line with the overall chain, so mid-single digit. And other than that, the only other call-outs were that we saw strong sales trends in our seasonal classifications. I kind of referenced that earlier when I was talking about the weather. We also saw strong sales trends in our back-to-school business in July. And then again throughout the quarter, we saw strong sales trends in beauty and in accessories. Well, good morning, Alex. Thanks for the question. Yes, at Burlington, we've always had a stronger position with younger customers and young families, stronger than most of our competitors. And we see that in our customer research. We also see it in our mix of businesses. So -- and I would say, we regard younger shoppers and young families as a core customer group for us. When you walk into our stores, you can kind of see it physically. We have a stronger presentation, I would say, and certainly a greater penetration of juniors, young men's, kids' apparel, kids' accessories, kids' footwear, again, than most of our competitors. Moving on to the part of your question about what are we doing to attract those customers, well, even though that customer segment is a strength for us, we absolutely do not take them for granted. We know that young shoppers and young families are really going to be important to us as we drive growth over the next several years. And we also know that they are financially stretched, so they need value. Our merchants are very focused on providing great value for those customers, offering a combination of fashion, quality, brands at great prices within a good-better-best assortment. I also -- I talked earlier about the strength that we've seen in back-to-school and back-to-campus businesses in the last couple of months. So, overall, I feel pretty good about the success we're having and about the strong trends that we're seeing with that customer group. Thanks. Good morning, Dana. And thank you for the question. So, on international expansion, I guess, let me start by saying that I believe that the off-price retail model has huge potential and application. In a number of overseas markets, I'm -- my belief is that everyone everywhere in every country loves the deal, loves a great deal. So, I think it makes a lot of sense for our larger off-price peers to expand their international footprint. They have the know-how and the resources to go after those overseas opportunities. And if and when those competitors run out of expansion opportunities in the United States, they can use those overseas investments to drive continued growth and shareholder value. So that makes sense. But the reality is that we at Burlington, I would say, are in a very, very different boat. We barely have 1,000 stores in the United States. Our peers have two to three times that number. So, we still have huge potential to expand right here in the USA. So, for us, that's job number one, job number two and job number three. One day, maybe it will make sense for us to divert resources to an international opportunity. But right now, and I would say for the foreseeable future, our complete focus and our resources have to be on the full potential and driving the full potential of our core US business. Thank you. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in November to discuss our third quarter 2024 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today, and please enjoy the holiday weekend."

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our Q1 results. Secondly, I will talk about our Q2 guidance, and finally I will comment on our full year outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our Q1 results and our updated 2024 guidance, then we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay, let\u2019s talk about our first quarter results. I am going to start with total sales. We believe that total sales growth compared to other retailers is the best proxy indicator for what is happening with market share. Our total sales in Q1 grew by 11% compared to the first quarter of 2023. That was on top of 11% total sales growth versus Q1 of 2022. New stores are a key driver of this top line growth. In Q1, we added 14 net new stores and ended the quarter with 1,021 stores. We are on track to open 100 net new stores this year. The other driver of top line sales is comp store sales growth. Comp store sales for the first quarter increased 2% versus our guidance of flat to 2%. This 2% comp store sales growth was on top of last year\u2019s Q1 comp store sales increase of plus-4%. As we described in our last earnings call on March 7, our February sales trend was softer than we had anticipated. We believe that this was attributable to disruptive winter weather, as well as the slower pace of tax refunds versus February of 2023. As we have discussed in the past, our core lower income shopper is sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, specifically refunds related to earned income tax credits. As you might expect, as tax refunds began to normalize, our sales trend improved as the quarter unfolded. In the March-April period combined, our comp sales increased a solid 4%. Because of the timing of Easter Sunday, it is very important to look at the comp sales trend for these two months combined. Similar to the fourth quarter, our regular price selling was particularly strong. For the quarter as a whole, our regular price comp growth was positive 4%, and for the March-April period, it was positive 6%. These growth rates more than offset a double-digit decrease in clearance sales. This level of regular price selling is very healthy. It shows that shoppers are responding well to the assortments and great values they are finding in our stores. Before I turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, I would like to comment on our strong profit growth in Q1. Our EBIT margin increased a robust 170 basis points and our adjusted EPS was up 68% over last year. As Kristin will explain in a moment, this favorability was partially driven by expense timing, but even after adjusting for this, our margin and earnings performance was well ahead of our guidance. There were two major drivers of this strong margin expansion. Firstly, as I mentioned a moment ago, our regular price selling was very strong. This drove faster turns and lower markdowns. The second major driver was faster than expected progress on our supply chain efficiency initiatives. We are encouraged by the strong early results that we are seeing from this program. Okay, let me move onto the outlook for the second quarter. Our comp guidance for Q2 is flat to 2%. We recognize that based on our most recent trend, there could be upside to this forecast, but there are a couple of reasons to remain cautious. Firstly, we believe that our strong March and April trend was driven by the catch-up in tax refunds and we expect that at some point, this tailwind could abate. Secondly, our comp growth for each of the past two quarters has been plus-2%, so it feels reasonable to keep our guidance tethered to plus-2%. If our Q2 trends turn out to be stronger than this guidance, I am confident that we will be able to chase it. It is worth calling out that in the first quarter as the comp trend picked up rapidly in March and April, our merchandising and supply chain teams did a nice job ramping up receipt flow to chase these sales. To reiterate, our Q2 comp guidance is zero to 2%, but we hope to do better. Let me segue now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. At this point, we are maintaining our comp guidance for the full year at flat to 2%. That said, based on the strength of our first quarter margin and earnings performance, we are raising our full year margin and adjusted EPS. Kristin will provide further details on this in a few moments. Reflecting on our start to 2024, I am very pleased with our underlying sales trends and our margin performance. We are well positioned for Q2 and the rest of the year. I\u2019m even more excited about the longer term opportunity in front of us. As we have discussed before, over the next five years, we believe that we can grow our sales to $16 billion and our operating income to $1.6 billion - that is almost three times our 2023 operating profit. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, who will share more details on our first quarter financial results, our outlook for Q2, and our updated full year 2024 guidance. Kristin?\nKristin Wolfe: Thank you Michael, and good morning everyone. Okay, let\u2019s now move onto the details of our first quarter results. Total sales grew 11% and comp sales grew 2%, both at the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 170 basis points versus last year, and adjusted earnings per share increased 68% compared to last year, both significantly ahead of guidance. The drivers of the better than expected margin expansion in Q1 were a much higher gross margin, improved expense leverage in supply chain, and a timing shift of approximately $9 million of expenses. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the first quarter was 43.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Freight expenses leveraged 30 basis points primarily due to lower freight rate and cost savings initiatives. Product sourcing costs were $183 million versus $187 million in the first quarter of 2023, decreasing 100 basis points as a percentage of sales. Eighty basis points of this favorability came from supply chain. There were two drivers of this supply chain leverage. First and most significantly, we made faster than expected progress on our distribution center productivity initiative, and secondly we benefited from the timing of receipts between Q1 and Q2. Adjusted SG&A costs in Q1 were 60 basis points higher than last year. This was partly driven by $6 million of dark rent and other expenses related to the Bed, Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding these expenses, adjusted SG&A deleverage was 40 basis points, driven primarily by increased investments in store payroll. Q1 EBIT margin was 5.7%, 170 basis points higher than last year compared with guidance for an increase of 20 to 60 basis points. Our adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was $1.42, which was well above the high end of our range of $0.95 to $1.10. This result and the guidance range exclude approximately $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed, Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 6% below 2023, while our reserve inventory was 40% of our total inventory versus 44% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $63 million in common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $442 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August of 2025. In the first quarter, we opened 14 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 1,021 stores. This included 36 new store openings, 11 relocations, and 11 closings. We continue to expect to open 100 net new stores in fiscal 2024. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year, the second quarter, and the back half of the year. We are increasing our full year earnings guidance and maintaining our comp sales outlook of flat to up 2%. In addition, due to slightly later timing of new store openings, we are making a modest adjustment to our expected total sales growth to an increase of 8% to 10% for the full fiscal year, just below our original guidance of 9% to 11%. Based on our strong first quarter financial performance, we are increasing our margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect our full year adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 40 to 60 basis points, up from our original guidance for an increase of 10 to 50 basis points. This updated margin outlook now translates to an adjusted earnings per share range of $7.35 to $7.75, up from our original guidance of $7 to $7.60. For the second quarter, we are guiding to a comp increase of flat to plus-2% and a total sales increase of 9% to 11%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 30 to up 50 basis points versus Q2 of 2023. This translates to earnings per share guidance for the second quarter of $0.83 to $0.93, which includes an approximately $0.09 negative impact from the timing of expenses from Q1. Consistent with prior quarters, this guidance excludes expenses associated with the recently acquired leases from Bed, Bath & Beyond of approximately $0.03. For the back half of fiscal 2024, this outlook assumes comp store sales of zero percent to plus-2%, total sales to increase 7% to 9% and EBIT margin to be flat to an increase of 30 basis points, and earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.40, an increase of 7% to 13% compared to last year. I will now turn the call back to Michael.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you Kristin. Let me recap four key points that we\u2019ve discussed this morning. Firstly, we are pleased with our sales growth in Q1: 11% total sales growth for the quarter, 2% comp sales growth for the quarter, and 4% comp sales growth for March-April combined. Secondly, we are very pleased with our Q1 margin and earnings results. These were driven by higher merchandise margins from strong regular priced selling leading to faster turns and lower markdowns, and also driven by faster than expected progress on our supply chain initiatives. Thirdly, we are maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance for Q2. We recognize that given our recent trend, this may be conservative, but we are very well positioned to chase. Finally, we are raising and updating our full year earnings guidance to reflect our strong, ahead of plan Q1 results. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks Matt.\nMatthew Boss: Michael, could you elaborate on the progression of your comp sales trend through the first quarter, walk through some of the factors, such as tax refunds that may have impacted the trend, and then could you comment on what you\u2019re seeing so far in May?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning Matt. Thank you for the question. I think it may be easier if I just share the month-by-month comp numbers. February was a minus-2 comp, March was a plus-1%, and April was up 8%. Now, to make sense of those numbers, it\u2019s important to adjust March and April for the timing of Easter. Our stores--like many retailers, our stores are closed on Easter Sunday. This year, Easter Sunday fell in March versus April last year, and that means that March had one less selling day this year and April had one more selling day this year, compared with 2023. That shift of a selling day is worth three to four points of comp within each month. If you adjust for the timing of Easter Sunday, then what you see is a strong pick-up in trend in March versus February, and then that momentum continued through April. We believe that the major driver of this month-by-month trajectory was the timing of tax refunds. As we\u2019ve explained in the past, our core lower income customer is very sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, especially the timing of earned income tax credits. In February, those refunds fell behind last year\u2019s levels. They did eventually catch up, but not until the end of March, and that timing correlates with the momentum in our sales trend. I would say there is one other factor that we think may have contributed to the monthly trend. This year, we made a deliberate decision to flow our seasonal merchandise later in the quarter than we did last year. The benefit of that is that it gave us a chance to read and react more effectively to early season trends at a business and a store level. By flowing receipts later, we will able to adjust the mix of those receipts and we were able to adjust the allocation of those receipts by store, based upon real selling data, and I would say that contributed to faster inventory turns, lower markdowns, and stronger sales. I guess the last part of your question was about May month-to-date. I would say that we are happy with how sales have been trending this month. Q2 is off to a good start, but as said, there\u2019s still a long way to go in the quarter.\nMatthew Boss: Great, and then maybe a follow-up for Kristin, just on your first quarter margin and the expense shift. Could you just provide any additional color on the expenses that shifted out of the first quarter and why, and then excluding the shift, could you just walk through the drivers of operating margin upside that you saw in the first quarter?\nKristin Wolfe: Matt, good morning. Yes, thanks for the questions. Overall, we did have a strong first quarter in terms of margin expansion, about 170 basis points versus last year, and this expansion does include a benefit from the timing of expenses worth about $9 million, or around 40 basis points out of Q1 and primarily into Q2. After accounting for the expense timing, our Q1 adjusted EBIT margin increased 130 basis points versus the first quarter of last year, which was well above our guidance of 20 to 60 basis points. Let me give a little more detail on the expense shift. There were really three drivers. The first was in supply chain, which represented approximately $3 million. This was driven by two factors. The biggest piece was the timing of receipts, so some receipts expected--that we expected to be processed in Q1 shifted to Q2; and then secondly, there were some start-up expenses associated with the opening of our new New Jersey distribution center, which opens in the second quarter, as we planned. The second factor in the expense timing was on freight - there was about $2 million in freight expenses that shifted from Q1 to Q2, and that was associated with the receipt timing, and then finally there was approximately $3 million of SG&A items - this includes the timing of marketing spend and select benefit expenses. These shifted out of the first quarter and into the second quarter, and then another $1 million of miscellaneous SG&A items that shifted out of Q1 and into fall. In total, the expense timing shift included $8 million of out Q1 and into Q2, and $1 million shifting out of Q1 and into fall. Looking at the quarter net of these expenses, as was part of your question, EBIT margin as I mentioned expanded by 130 basis points, and this was really driven by three primary factors: first, a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to faster inventory turns and lower markdowns; secondly, 70 basis points of leverage--and excluding the timing of expenses there, 70 basis points of leverage in supply chain, and then 20 basis points of leverage on freight. Partly offsetting the leverage of those items was deleverage in SG&A, namely in store payroll, and then also in depreciation given the higher capex spend.\nMatthew Boss: That\u2019s great color. Best of luck.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks Matt.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning everyone. Great print. Two questions. First for Michael, if we could kind of unpack the low end consumer a little bit more. I know you guys have a lot of ties there, and likely you\u2019ve spoke about that a little bit. We\u2019ve heard a lot of noise and volatility in that consumer. It looks like you guys bucked that trend pretty nicely in the quarter, so I guess my question is what exactly are you seeing with that cohort of the consumer base today, and then what exactly did you guys do to help perform there?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Ike, thank you for the questions. Let me start by saying that we think the external environment is very hard to read right now, but our assessment is that all income groups, not just lower income consumers, all income groups are feeling economic pressure. I know this is not a very sophisticated framework, but we divide the world into two main segments: need a deal shoppers, who tend to be lower income and have larger family size, and want a deal shoppers, who tend to have slightly higher incomes and more financial choices. Both of those segments shop off-price. Now, the need a deal shopper needs value especially at opening price points and on moderate brands, and as we said before, that shopper is very important to us. In your question, you kind of referenced noise and, I would say, investor concerns about those lower income consumers. We actually think that at this point, that noise, those concerns may be overblown. We think that at this point, those concerns are mostly in the rear--they concern a phenomenon that\u2019s really in the rear view mirror. In 2022, and we certainly felt this, those lower income shoppers were crushed by the combination of the higher cost of living and the end of pandemic-era benefits; but our view is that since then, in other words over the last five quarters, discretionary income for that demographic appears to have stabilized. Now, that consumer is still fragile and we saw evidence of that with the delayed tax refunds in February, but inflation has come down and it looks like real incomes at the lower end are not shrinking in the way that they were in 2022. We\u2019re not saying that the situation for this customer is getting better yet - they\u2019re not bouncing back, but our assessment is that the situation doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any worse. Coming back to your question, how to explain our strong trend in March and April, I think that there are two factors that explain that trend. Number one, the catch-up in tax refunds in that period meant that lower income shoppers had some extra money in their pockets. In the last couple of years, that shopper has really come to appreciate Burlington as a great place to find value, so it\u2019s natural that they would come to us when they have some extra money to spend. The second factor is unrelated to lower income shoppers. When we look at selling, especially on better brands at higher price points, we believe that we are seeing--we\u2019re benefiting from more trade-down traffic in our stores, and that\u2019s helping to support our comp trend. In 2022, it felt as if moderate to high income shoppers were somewhat insulated from the impacts of inflation, perhaps they had excess savings that they could tap into. But we believe that now, that demographic is also feeling the pinch - we think that\u2019s good for us. It means that those customers are shopping off-price in search of value.\nIke Boruchow: Got it, very helpful. Then Kristin, if I can sneak one more in, you referenced the supply chain efficiencies in the quarter benefiting you. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? What exactly are those drivers that led to some of that upside in the first quarter, and then I guess a follow-up to that is, is there more to come there, is this just a one-time thing in the first quarter, is there possibly more efficiencies to come? Thanks.\nKristin Wolfe: Great, good morning Ike. It\u2019s a good question. We were encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in terms of driving down supply chain costs as a percentage of sales. Excluding that expense shift I just talked about in Q2, supply chain leveraged 70 basis points, which is more than we had planned. I\u2019ve shared before, we\u2019ve talked about a number of productivity initiatives we have in place in supply chain, where we\u2019re targeting meaningful cost savings. These are process improvements, industrial engineering-oriented improvements that streamline operations, reduce touches, reduce time to process merchandise, and ultimately save labor dollars in our DCs. In the first quarter, we found we are harvesting these savings a bit faster than we\u2019d originally expected. To your follow-up question on is there to come, yes, as you know, we\u2019ve said we believe that we have about 400 basis points of EBIT margin opportunity over the next five years - that\u2019s using 2023 EBIT of around 6% as the baseline, and we believe about half of this, 200 basis points of the margin opportunity is independent of sales, and a meaningful part of this 200 basis points will come from--we expect to come from continued supply chain leverage, with the balance coming from lower freight and higher merchandise margin. We feel like we\u2019ve demonstrated good progress in the first quarter on all three of those line items, particularly supply chain.\nIke Boruchow: Awesome, thanks again.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you, good morning. Michael, your off-price peers have talked about increasing their mix of brand as a way to drive comps. In March, you said this might be an opportunity for you as well. Do you have any update on this, and also I\u2019m curious if you see any risks to this strategy.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Lorraine, good to hear from you. Yes, we do see an opportunity to increase our mix of brands, and actually more generally, we see an opportunity to elevate our assortments. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing some success with that approach in businesses like sportswear, but we plan to lean into that opportunity more, I would say in the back half of the year. But let me spend a minute just sort of talking about the role that brands play in our business, and also addressing the last part of your question about the risks or the limits of that strategy. In off-price, brands are important, but the most critical thing by far is value. Brands are just one component of value. Fashion, quality, and of course price also drive the customer\u2019s perception of value. You can have a great brand, but if the fashion, the quality or the price are wrong, the customer isn\u2019t going to buy it, it\u2019s going to end up in the clearance run. The second point to make is that the role that the brand plays in defining value depends on the category and also depends on the customer and their price sensitivity. That\u2019s why our merchants spend a lot of time planning and styling out the whole rack and then executing our good-better-best strategy. Again, brands are important, but they\u2019re just one piece of that. I should add that calculus may be different for other retailers, depending upon their own customer profile. Okay, so with all of that as context, let me talk about where we see opportunity. As I said earlier, in this economy we believe that all shoppers are now focused on value. We know that we do--I think we do an excellent job when it comes to the low income, need a deal shopper, and let me emphasize we continue--we intend to continue to do an excellent job with those very important customers, but we think we can also do more to drive sales with trade-down or slightly higher income shoppers. When those shoppers walk in our store, they\u2019re more likely to be drawn to great deals on better brands, so as we get further into the year, you\u2019ll see more of those brands in our runs. Now as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019ll do that selectively in businesses where it works and where brands really matter, but let me maybe finish up by maybe reinforcing the point. We see this as an \u2018and\u2019 strategy - you know, we\u2019ll go after this trade-down opportunity and we\u2019re going to continue to deliver for our core need a deal shoppers as well.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you, and then Kristin, the margin performance in the first quarter was much better than we expected. Obviously the balance of fiscal \u201924, including 2Q, is not calling for that kind of increase in EBIT margins. What was unique about the first quarter that enabled such strong flow-through, and why aren\u2019t we seeing the same outlook for the balance of the year? Also, what should we expect in 3Q and 4Q?\nKristin Wolfe: Great, good morning Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Certainly we had strong margin performance in Q1. Lower clearance levels and faster turns really helped drive strong merchandise margins, and our supply chain leverage was better than we had expected, as I spoke about just a few moments ago. But to your question and turning to the second quarter, there are a couple call-outs I want to make. First, we have about $9 million of expenses that shifted out of Q1, of which $8 million shifted into Q2, so that\u2019s having around a 30 basis point negative EBIT margin impact on the second quarter. In addition, our newest distribution center in New Jersey will be coming online in the second quarter, in this quarter, which will add some modest deleverage in supply chain, given the start-up and training costs. Now, we expect that this will be more than offset by the productivity initiative I just talked about in supply chain, but that will likely temper the leverage in supply chain in Q2. Then to your last question on the back half of the year, there is a 53rd week impact. Fall total sales growth is planned for 7% to 9%, slightly lower than our full-year guidance of 8% to 10%. The 53rd week has the most acute impact on Q4 sales growth, where we are essentially trading a week in November for a week in January as compared to Q4 last year from a total sales growth standpoint. Now, we\u2019ll share more detail on Q3 and Q4 margin guidance on our call in August, but for now as you think about modeling Q3 and Q4, keep in mind that the total sales growth for Q3 will be higher than Q4 due to the 53rd week calendar impact, which will impact--which will thereby impact the relative margin improvement for Q3 versus Q4.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Kernan: Thanks, good morning Michael, Kristin, David. Nice job on the top line and the margin flow-through. Kristin, let\u2019s just keep it on the margin theme here. It looks like freight was a margin driver in Q1. Will freight continue to be a margin tailwind for the rest of the year? Is there any chance it becomes a headwind as you get further into the year, and then just a quick follow-up for David after that.\nKristin Wolfe: Great, good morning John. Appreciate the questions. We were pleased with the 30 basis points of leverage we saw in freight in the first quarter. About 10 basis points, as I described, was due to the timing of receipts, but the majority of the leverage was due to favorable freight rates and specific transportation-related cost savings initiatives we have. We do expect to continue to see freight leverage this year. We\u2019re unlikely to get all of the way back to FY19 freight expense, as we\u2019ve previously discussed, but we recently finalized our latest round of domestic freight contracts, and we\u2019re pleased with where we landed. Freight should continue to drive expense leverage through all of 2024, and in addition diesel fuel rates have begun to become a modest tailwind here.\nJohn Kernan: Got it, thanks. David, just on the balance sheet in today\u2019s release, the convertible notes, it looks like they become a current liability in Q1. What\u2019s the plan on retiring these? Just wondering also if there\u2019s any impact to the stock repurchase program or share count - sometimes the accounting for converts can be pretty tricky to model.\nDavid Glick: Thanks John, appreciate--glad you asked about the converts, good question. Before I answer your question directly, I just want to talk about our liquidity. We feel very good about our current liquidity. We ended the quarter with $742 million in cash, we had no borrowings on our ABL, and about $1.5 billion in total liquidity. Secondly, we\u2019re really comfortable with our total debt levels and we would expect, as hopefully our EBITDA continues to grow, that our leverage ratios would stay on the healthy trend of improvement we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Getting to your question on the 2025 convertible notes, yes, they became a current liability as of the end of this quarter. There\u2019s $156 million outstanding that mature in April 2025. If you recall, John, we did an amend and extend convert transaction in 2023, and at that time it was our intention to ultimately reduce the total amount of converts outstanding on our balance sheet, and we extended $297 million in new convertible notes out to December 2027, while purposely allowing the converts you referenced, the $156 million, the 2025s, to go to maturity. Given the strong liquidity that I just referenced, we\u2019re very comfortable retiring that $156 million of principal with cash on hand next April, and as you might expect, this is a strategy that we socialized up front with the rating agencies before we completed the transaction. Getting to the heart of your question about buybacks, since we completed the convert transaction last year, we\u2019ve bought back about $164 million in stock between Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year. We indicated on our last earnings call that we viewed last year\u2019s level of buybacks, which was $232 million, as a reasonable proxy or target for buybacks this year, and as you probably noted in the press release, we have $442 million remaining on our current share price authorization. Look, we know our shareholders value a consistent approach to share repurchases, and our intention would be, given our strong liquidity as well as what we expect to generate in cash flow, that we would continue to buy back shares consistently, not only in 2024 but 2025 as well, assuming our financial performance continues as we have it planned.\nJohn Kernan: Got it, thanks.\nDavid Glick: Thanks John.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning and thank you for taking our question. Michael, several retailers have recently announced that they\u2019re reducing or sharpening their price and value equation. What impacts could these lower prices have on Burlington, and what is your strategy or reaction?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Well, good morning Brooke. Thank you for the question. You\u2019re right - it does feel like a number of retailers have recently talked about reducing, sharpening or rolling back their prices. As an off-price retailer, relative value is critically important to us, so we pay close attention to what competitors are saying. That said, there are a few reasons why I think we are in pretty good shape. Firstly, many retailers raised their prices over the last few years. Now that the consumer is pushing back, it\u2019s not that surprising that some retailers are having to roll their prices back. In contrast, we have not raised prices; in fact, our average retails are lower now than they were two years ago. The reason for that is that our core customer has been under significant economic pressure since the end of 2021, so we\u2019ve had to stay very, very sharp on value. In other words, I feel like we\u2019re already starting from a very strong value position. Secondly, our merchants are in our competitors\u2019 stores every week: off-price, department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce websites and other retailers. They\u2019re looking through the assortments, the styles, the prices. They\u2019re looking at what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not, and what\u2019s left in the clearance rack. As I mentioned a moment ago with merchandising 2.0, we have better visibility than we\u2019ve ever had before into what\u2019s on our floor and how well it\u2019s turning. That means that we can respond very quickly if we need to make an adjustment. The third and final thing I\u2019d say is that the guidance that we\u2019ve discussed today already builds in some room in case we need to reduce mark-up later this year in order to make our values even stronger. It\u2019s worth calling out that the Q1 gross margin that we\u2019ve reported today at 43.5% is a historic record for the first quarter for Burlington, it\u2019s even higher than Q1 of 2021. We\u2019re driving those margins by turning faster and taking fewer markdowns. We think we may have more favorability there, but within our guidance, we have left room in case we need to further sharpen our value and pass along that favorability to shoppers.\nBrooke Roach: That\u2019s really helpful. For Kristin, can you elaborate on that point on the expectations for merchandise margin as you move throughout the year, given some of the puts and takes on mark-on versus the year-on-year trend on regular priced selling relative to clearance from last year? Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Sure. No, it\u2019s a good question. We certainly saw higher merchandise margin in the first quarter with the lower clearance, faster turns, lower markdowns. Go forward, I\u2019d say we think looking at--we do feel like there\u2019s an opportunity to continue seeing a faster turn, faster inventory turn and thereby lower markdowns, maybe not as much opportunity on mark-up, but do feel like we have opportunity going forward on faster turn. We still turn a little bit slower than some of our peers and feel like there\u2019s an opportunity there to drive improved merch margin, and that\u2019s part of that 200 basis points of margin opportunity that\u2019s independent of sales, that I talked about earlier. Higher merch margin is part of that, really based on a faster turn.\nBrooke Roach: Great, thanks so much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAlex Straton: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just firstly, I wanted to dive into new store openings. As you open up new stores, do you think you\u2019re attracting new customers to Burlington; and then if you are, who do you think you are taking these customers from?\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Good morning Alex. That\u2019s a great question. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, total sales growth in Q1 was up 11% versus 2023--versus Q1 of 2023, and that itself was on top of positive 11% growth versus Q1 of 2022. Obviously those numbers heavily indicate that we are drawing incremental customers to our stores. That said, Burlington has been around for a long time and most of our new stores are opening in markets and geographies where we already have a presence, so what we\u2019re seeing in our data is that, yes, some of the shoppers walking into our stores are completely new, but many others actually shopped Burlington many years ago, maybe their mother brought them in to buy a coat back in the day. But what\u2019s exciting is that when they walk into our one of our stores today, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re walking into a completely different retailer. It feels like a new Burlington, and to all intends and purposes these are essentially new customers for us, so yes, one way or another we believe that our new store opening program is attracting new customers to Burlington. On the last part of your question, where are these customers coming from, I would say that there is not one single source. Of course, at a macro level we can see that there are certain retail formats, such as department stores and specialty stores, that are struggling and are losing share year-on-year. We don\u2019t have specific data, but it seems like a reasonable inference that we must be picking up some of the market share that they are losing. That said, we operate in a large fragmented and very competitive space with off-price, department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce and other retail formats, and we know from our own customer surveys that our customers cross-shop heavily in looking for the best value. The implication for us is if we offer the best value, then we can draw market share, I think from a wide range of retail competitors.\nAlex Straton: Great. Maybe just a second one for me, but on the flipside - store closures. It looks like you relocated or closed a lot of stores in the quarter. Can you just provide more color on what was going on there, and then how many additional stores do you think you ultimately need to close or relocate? Thanks a lot.\nKristin Wolfe: Great, good morning, Alex. I\u2019ll take that one - it\u2019s Kristin. It\u2019s a good question. We did close or relocate a number of stores in the first quarter. On a net basis, we opened 14 new stores, but we opened 36 gross new stores in the first quarter, which means we closed or relocated 22 stores on our base of a little over 1,000 stores. For the year, we plan to close or relocate approximately 40 stores, and we plan to open about 140 gross new stores. This means we\u2019re moving out of approximately 40 older, oversized stores that tend to be in secondary or tertiary centers. We\u2019re moving into higher traffic centers that tend to trade more broadly across income demographics, and this year is really representative of what we plan to do over the next several years as leases expire and new locations in these higher traffic centers become available. We expect to close or relocate about 150 to 200 stores over the next five years.\nAlex Straton: Thanks so much. Good luck.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAdrienne Yih: Great, thank you very much, and let me add my congratulations. Great start to the year. Michael, can you comment on the drivers of comp growth in Q1 traffic AUR, UPT, and then how those transition through the quarter and into the May quarter to date? Then Kristin, my follow-up is on the deleverage that you mentioned on Q1 on store payroll. We\u2019re hearing from some other retailers that there\u2019s some stability in turnover and maybe average ROE rate gains are slowing. What drove this, and are you expecting that same deleverage through the rest of the year? Thank you very much.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning Adrienne. I\u2019ll actually take both of your questions. The first was on the components of comp. The primary drivers of first quarter comp were both traffic and conversion. Together, the increase in total transactions, that\u2019s what really drove the comp in the quarter. Higher conversion is great because it tells us when she comes in our store, she sees the content and value that she likes, and we see that in conversion. AUR was down slightly in the quarter due to mix of business and our continued focus on opening price point, and units per transaction were up slightly. Traffic and conversion improved as we moved through the quarter, as you would expect. I think both metrics were stronger in the March-April period than in February. Then your second question was on store payroll. It\u2019s a good question. We mentioned it in the prepared remarks - excluding Bed, Bath & Beyond dark rent expenses, SG&A deleverage was 40 basis points, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in store payroll. As a reminder, in early 2023, we thought we had opportunity to improve our customer shopping experience and improve store condition to ensure stores were neat, clean, easy to shop. To address this opportunity, we made a purposeful investment in store payroll beginning in the back half of last year, and we\u2019ll lap this payroll investment in the fall of this year. Typically, you can expect that we see SG&A leverage at around a 3% comp. I think the last part of your question was around store wages, and we tend to take a market by market approach. We plan for, obviously, the legislative increases, but we also plan for competitive and market related wage increases, and we\u2019re seeing stability there, and our approach of market by market seems to be working.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Thank you so much, and best of luck.\nKristin Wolfe: Thanks Adrienne.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Hi, good morning everyone, and congratulations on the results. In regards to real estate, two questions. Any update on the Bed, Bath & Beyond stores that you took - are they all open now, how are they doing, and are all the one-time Bed, Bath & Beyond expenses behind you? Then just secondly, I saw that you picked up some of the 99 Cents Only leases in the bankruptcy auction. Any update or detail on those stores, and are they likely to open this year? Thank you.\nKristin Wolfe: Good morning Dana. Yes, thanks for these questions. It\u2019s still early, but we feel very good about the Bed, Bath & Beyond stores. As a reminder, we expect that on average, new store sales volumes will be about $7 million in the first full year, and we expect that these Bed, Bath & Beyond stores as a group will achieve or beat that expectation. Of the 64 Bed, Bath locations, we opened 32 last year in fiscal 2023. The majority of those were in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter this year, we opened 20 Bed, Bath & Beyond stores, and we expect to open the remaining 12 in the second quarter, although it\u2019s possible we could have a few stragglers that fall into Q3. As far as the dark rent cost, in Q4 of 2023 associated with Bed, Bath were about $6 million, and in all of 2023, fiscal 2023, that cost was about $18 million. In the first quarter of this year, in \u201924, those Bed, Bath & Beyond dark rent costs were $6 million, and for Q2 we have modeled in the guidance we expect about $3 million of Bed, Bath & Beyond dark rent expense. After that, it should be largely behind us. I think your second question was on 99 Cents Only - yes, it\u2019s a good question. We evaluated over 370 store locations that became available in the 99 Cents Only bankruptcy. We really scrutinized these, but really very few of these sites had the characteristics we\u2019re looking for - we\u2019re looking for busy strip malls, national co-tenants, strong traffic, sales potential, nor did many clear our new store financial hurdles, so based on our analysis, we\u2019ll likely secure just a handful of these locations. If we secure these stores, they\u2019ll join our pipeline in \u201925 or even \u201926. In August, we\u2019ll plan to offer a more detailed update as some of the negotiations are still ongoing there. Thanks for the question.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Michael O\u2019Sullivan, I turn the call back over to you.\nMichael O\u2019Sullivan: Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in August to discuss our second quarter 2024 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristin Wolfe",
            "content": "Thank you Michael, and good morning everyone. Okay, let's now move onto the details of our first quarter results. Total sales grew 11% and comp sales grew 2%, both at the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBIT margin expanded 170 basis points versus last year, and adjusted earnings per share increased 68% compared to last year, both significantly ahead of guidance. The drivers of the better than expected margin expansion in Q1 were a much higher gross margin, improved expense leverage in supply chain, and a timing shift of approximately $9 million of expenses. Let me walk through the details. The gross margin rate for the first quarter was 43.5%, an increase of 120 basis points versus last year. This was driven by a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to strong regular price selling, which generated faster inventory turns and lower markdowns. Freight expenses leveraged 30 basis points primarily due to lower freight rate and cost savings initiatives. Product sourcing costs were $183 million versus $187 million in the first quarter of 2023, decreasing 100 basis points as a percentage of sales. Eighty basis points of this favorability came from supply chain. There were two drivers of this supply chain leverage. First and most significantly, we made faster than expected progress on our distribution center productivity initiative, and secondly we benefited from the timing of receipts between Q1 and Q2. Adjusted SG&A costs in Q1 were 60 basis points higher than last year. This was partly driven by $6 million of dark rent and other expenses related to the Bed, Bath & Beyond leases. Excluding these expenses, adjusted SG&A deleverage was 40 basis points, driven primarily by increased investments in store payroll. Q1 EBIT margin was 5.7%, 170 basis points higher than last year compared with guidance for an increase of 20 to 60 basis points. Our adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was $1.42, which was well above the high end of our range of $0.95 to $1.10. This result and the guidance range exclude approximately $6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with the Bed, Bath & Beyond leases. At the end of the quarter, our comparable store inventories were 6% below 2023, while our reserve inventory was 40% of our total inventory versus 44% last year. We are very happy with the quality of the merchandise and the values that we have in reserve. During the quarter, we repurchased $63 million in common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $442 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires in August of 2025. In the first quarter, we opened 14 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 1,021 stores. This included 36 new store openings, 11 relocations, and 11 closings. We continue to expect to open 100 net new stores in fiscal 2024. Now I will turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year, the second quarter, and the back half of the year. We are increasing our full year earnings guidance and maintaining our comp sales outlook of flat to up 2%. In addition, due to slightly later timing of new store openings, we are making a modest adjustment to our expected total sales growth to an increase of 8% to 10% for the full fiscal year, just below our original guidance of 9% to 11%. Based on our strong first quarter financial performance, we are increasing our margin and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect our full year adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 40 to 60 basis points, up from our original guidance for an increase of 10 to 50 basis points. This updated margin outlook now translates to an adjusted earnings per share range of $7.35 to $7.75, up from our original guidance of $7 to $7.60. For the second quarter, we are guiding to a comp increase of flat to plus-2% and a total sales increase of 9% to 11%. This would result in operating margin expansion of up 30 to up 50 basis points versus Q2 of 2023. This translates to earnings per share guidance for the second quarter of $0.83 to $0.93, which includes an approximately $0.09 negative impact from the timing of expenses from Q1. Consistent with prior quarters, this guidance excludes expenses associated with the recently acquired leases from Bed, Bath & Beyond of approximately $0.03. For the back half of fiscal 2024, this outlook assumes comp store sales of zero percent to plus-2%, total sales to increase 7% to 9% and EBIT margin to be flat to an increase of 30 basis points, and earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.40, an increase of 7% to 13% compared to last year. I will now turn the call back to Michael. Matt, good morning. Yes, thanks for the questions. Overall, we did have a strong first quarter in terms of margin expansion, about 170 basis points versus last year, and this expansion does include a benefit from the timing of expenses worth about $9 million, or around 40 basis points out of Q1 and primarily into Q2. After accounting for the expense timing, our Q1 adjusted EBIT margin increased 130 basis points versus the first quarter of last year, which was well above our guidance of 20 to 60 basis points. Let me give a little more detail on the expense shift. There were really three drivers. The first was in supply chain, which represented approximately $3 million. This was driven by two factors. The biggest piece was the timing of receipts, so some receipts expected--that we expected to be processed in Q1 shifted to Q2; and then secondly, there were some start-up expenses associated with the opening of our new New Jersey distribution center, which opens in the second quarter, as we planned. The second factor in the expense timing was on freight - there was about $2 million in freight expenses that shifted from Q1 to Q2, and that was associated with the receipt timing, and then finally there was approximately $3 million of SG&A items - this includes the timing of marketing spend and select benefit expenses. These shifted out of the first quarter and into the second quarter, and then another $1 million of miscellaneous SG&A items that shifted out of Q1 and into fall. In total, the expense timing shift included $8 million of out Q1 and into Q2, and $1 million shifting out of Q1 and into fall. Looking at the quarter net of these expenses, as was part of your question, EBIT margin as I mentioned expanded by 130 basis points, and this was really driven by three primary factors: first, a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin due to faster inventory turns and lower markdowns; secondly, 70 basis points of leverage--and excluding the timing of expenses there, 70 basis points of leverage in supply chain, and then 20 basis points of leverage on freight. Partly offsetting the leverage of those items was deleverage in SG&A, namely in store payroll, and then also in depreciation given the higher capex spend. Thanks Matt. Great, good morning Ike. It's a good question. We were encouraged by the progress we're making in terms of driving down supply chain costs as a percentage of sales. Excluding that expense shift I just talked about in Q2, supply chain leveraged 70 basis points, which is more than we had planned. I've shared before, we've talked about a number of productivity initiatives we have in place in supply chain, where we're targeting meaningful cost savings. These are process improvements, industrial engineering-oriented improvements that streamline operations, reduce touches, reduce time to process merchandise, and ultimately save labor dollars in our DCs. In the first quarter, we found we are harvesting these savings a bit faster than we'd originally expected. To your follow-up question on is there to come, yes, as you know, we've said we believe that we have about 400 basis points of EBIT margin opportunity over the next five years - that's using 2023 EBIT of around 6% as the baseline, and we believe about half of this, 200 basis points of the margin opportunity is independent of sales, and a meaningful part of this 200 basis points will come from--we expect to come from continued supply chain leverage, with the balance coming from lower freight and higher merchandise margin. We feel like we've demonstrated good progress in the first quarter on all three of those line items, particularly supply chain. Great, good morning Lorraine. Thanks for the question. Certainly we had strong margin performance in Q1. Lower clearance levels and faster turns really helped drive strong merchandise margins, and our supply chain leverage was better than we had expected, as I spoke about just a few moments ago. But to your question and turning to the second quarter, there are a couple call-outs I want to make. First, we have about $9 million of expenses that shifted out of Q1, of which $8 million shifted into Q2, so that's having around a 30 basis point negative EBIT margin impact on the second quarter. In addition, our newest distribution center in New Jersey will be coming online in the second quarter, in this quarter, which will add some modest deleverage in supply chain, given the start-up and training costs. Now, we expect that this will be more than offset by the productivity initiative I just talked about in supply chain, but that will likely temper the leverage in supply chain in Q2. Then to your last question on the back half of the year, there is a 53rd week impact. Fall total sales growth is planned for 7% to 9%, slightly lower than our full-year guidance of 8% to 10%. The 53rd week has the most acute impact on Q4 sales growth, where we are essentially trading a week in November for a week in January as compared to Q4 last year from a total sales growth standpoint. Now, we'll share more detail on Q3 and Q4 margin guidance on our call in August, but for now as you think about modeling Q3 and Q4, keep in mind that the total sales growth for Q3 will be higher than Q4 due to the 53rd week calendar impact, which will impact--which will thereby impact the relative margin improvement for Q3 versus Q4. Great, good morning John. Appreciate the questions. We were pleased with the 30 basis points of leverage we saw in freight in the first quarter. About 10 basis points, as I described, was due to the timing of receipts, but the majority of the leverage was due to favorable freight rates and specific transportation-related cost savings initiatives we have. We do expect to continue to see freight leverage this year. We're unlikely to get all of the way back to FY19 freight expense, as we've previously discussed, but we recently finalized our latest round of domestic freight contracts, and we're pleased with where we landed. Freight should continue to drive expense leverage through all of 2024, and in addition diesel fuel rates have begun to become a modest tailwind here. Sure. No, it's a good question. We certainly saw higher merchandise margin in the first quarter with the lower clearance, faster turns, lower markdowns. Go forward, I'd say we think looking at--we do feel like there's an opportunity to continue seeing a faster turn, faster inventory turn and thereby lower markdowns, maybe not as much opportunity on mark-up, but do feel like we have opportunity going forward on faster turn. We still turn a little bit slower than some of our peers and feel like there's an opportunity there to drive improved merch margin, and that's part of that 200 basis points of margin opportunity that's independent of sales, that I talked about earlier. Higher merch margin is part of that, really based on a faster turn. Great, good morning, Alex. I'll take that one - it's Kristin. It's a good question. We did close or relocate a number of stores in the first quarter. On a net basis, we opened 14 new stores, but we opened 36 gross new stores in the first quarter, which means we closed or relocated 22 stores on our base of a little over 1,000 stores. For the year, we plan to close or relocate approximately 40 stores, and we plan to open about 140 gross new stores. This means we're moving out of approximately 40 older, oversized stores that tend to be in secondary or tertiary centers. We're moving into higher traffic centers that tend to trade more broadly across income demographics, and this year is really representative of what we plan to do over the next several years as leases expire and new locations in these higher traffic centers become available. We expect to close or relocate about 150 to 200 stores over the next five years. Good morning Adrienne. I'll actually take both of your questions. The first was on the components of comp. The primary drivers of first quarter comp were both traffic and conversion. Together, the increase in total transactions, that's what really drove the comp in the quarter.

After that, it should be largely behind us. I think your second question was on 99 Cents Only - yes, it's a good question.

            "name": "Michael O'Sullivan",
            "content": "Thank you David. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I would like to cover three topics this morning. Firstly, I will discuss our Q1 results. Secondly, I will talk about our Q2 guidance, and finally I will comment on our full year outlook. After that, I will hand over to Kristin to walk through the financial details of our Q1 results and our updated 2024 guidance, then we will be happy to respond to your questions. Okay, let's talk about our first quarter results. I am going to start with total sales. We believe that total sales growth compared to other retailers is the best proxy indicator for what is happening with market share. Our total sales in Q1 grew by 11% compared to the first quarter of 2023. That was on top of 11% total sales growth versus Q1 of 2022. New stores are a key driver of this top line growth. In Q1, we added 14 net new stores and ended the quarter with 1,021 stores. We are on track to open 100 net new stores this year. The other driver of top line sales is comp store sales growth. Comp store sales for the first quarter increased 2% versus our guidance of flat to 2%. This 2% comp store sales growth was on top of last year's Q1 comp store sales increase of plus-4%. As we described in our last earnings call on March 7, our February sales trend was softer than we had anticipated. We believe that this was attributable to disruptive winter weather, as well as the slower pace of tax refunds versus February of 2023. As we have discussed in the past, our core lower income shopper is sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, specifically refunds related to earned income tax credits. As you might expect, as tax refunds began to normalize, our sales trend improved as the quarter unfolded. In the March-April period combined, our comp sales increased a solid 4%. Because of the timing of Easter Sunday, it is very important to look at the comp sales trend for these two months combined. Similar to the fourth quarter, our regular price selling was particularly strong. For the quarter as a whole, our regular price comp growth was positive 4%, and for the March-April period, it was positive 6%. These growth rates more than offset a double-digit decrease in clearance sales. This level of regular price selling is very healthy. It shows that shoppers are responding well to the assortments and great values they are finding in our stores. Before I turn to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, I would like to comment on our strong profit growth in Q1. Our EBIT margin increased a robust 170 basis points and our adjusted EPS was up 68% over last year. As Kristin will explain in a moment, this favorability was partially driven by expense timing, but even after adjusting for this, our margin and earnings performance was well ahead of our guidance. There were two major drivers of this strong margin expansion. Firstly, as I mentioned a moment ago, our regular price selling was very strong. This drove faster turns and lower markdowns. The second major driver was faster than expected progress on our supply chain efficiency initiatives. We are encouraged by the strong early results that we are seeing from this program. Okay, let me move onto the outlook for the second quarter. Our comp guidance for Q2 is flat to 2%. We recognize that based on our most recent trend, there could be upside to this forecast, but there are a couple of reasons to remain cautious. Firstly, we believe that our strong March and April trend was driven by the catch-up in tax refunds and we expect that at some point, this tailwind could abate. Secondly, our comp growth for each of the past two quarters has been plus-2%, so it feels reasonable to keep our guidance tethered to plus-2%. If our Q2 trends turn out to be stronger than this guidance, I am confident that we will be able to chase it. It is worth calling out that in the first quarter as the comp trend picked up rapidly in March and April, our merchandising and supply chain teams did a nice job ramping up receipt flow to chase these sales. To reiterate, our Q2 comp guidance is zero to 2%, but we hope to do better. Let me segue now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. At this point, we are maintaining our comp guidance for the full year at flat to 2%. That said, based on the strength of our first quarter margin and earnings performance, we are raising our full year margin and adjusted EPS. Kristin will provide further details on this in a few moments. Reflecting on our start to 2024, I am very pleased with our underlying sales trends and our margin performance. We are well positioned for Q2 and the rest of the year. I'm even more excited about the longer term opportunity in front of us. As we have discussed before, over the next five years, we believe that we can grow our sales to $16 billion and our operating income to $1.6 billion - that is almost three times our 2023 operating profit. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kristin, who will share more details on our first quarter financial results, our outlook for Q2, and our updated full year 2024 guidance. Kristin? Thank you Kristin. Let me recap four key points that we've discussed this morning. Firstly, we are pleased with our sales growth in Q1: 11% total sales growth for the quarter, 2% comp sales growth for the quarter, and 4% comp sales growth for March-April combined. Secondly, we are very pleased with our Q1 margin and earnings results. These were driven by higher merchandise margins from strong regular priced selling leading to faster turns and lower markdowns, and also driven by faster than expected progress on our supply chain initiatives. Thirdly, we are maintaining our flat to 2% comp guidance for Q2. We recognize that given our recent trend, this may be conservative, but we are very well positioned to chase. Finally, we are raising and updating our full year earnings guidance to reflect our strong, ahead of plan Q1 results. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Thanks Matt. Well, good morning Matt. Thank you for the question. I think it may be easier if I just share the month-by-month comp numbers. February was a minus-2 comp, March was a plus-1%, and April was up 8%. Now, to make sense of those numbers, it's important to adjust March and April for the timing of Easter. Our stores--like many retailers, our stores are closed on Easter Sunday. This year, Easter Sunday fell in March versus April last year, and that means that March had one less selling day this year and April had one more selling day this year, compared with 2023. That shift of a selling day is worth three to four points of comp within each month. If you adjust for the timing of Easter Sunday, then what you see is a strong pick-up in trend in March versus February, and then that momentum continued through April. We believe that the major driver of this month-by-month trajectory was the timing of tax refunds. As we've explained in the past, our core lower income customer is very sensitive to the timing of tax refunds, especially the timing of earned income tax credits. In February, those refunds fell behind last year's levels. They did eventually catch up, but not until the end of March, and that timing correlates with the momentum in our sales trend. I would say there is one other factor that we think may have contributed to the monthly trend. This year, we made a deliberate decision to flow our seasonal merchandise later in the quarter than we did last year. The benefit of that is that it gave us a chance to read and react more effectively to early season trends at a business and a store level. By flowing receipts later, we will able to adjust the mix of those receipts and we were able to adjust the allocation of those receipts by store, based upon real selling data, and I would say that contributed to faster inventory turns, lower markdowns, and stronger sales. I guess the last part of your question was about May month-to-date. I would say that we are happy with how sales have been trending this month. Q2 is off to a good start, but as said, there's still a long way to go in the quarter. Thanks. Good morning Ike, thank you for the questions. Let me start by saying that we think the external environment is very hard to read right now, but our assessment is that all income groups, not just lower income consumers, all income groups are feeling economic pressure. I know this is not a very sophisticated framework, but we divide the world into two main segments: need a deal shoppers, who tend to be lower income and have larger family size, and want a deal shoppers, who tend to have slightly higher incomes and more financial choices. Both of those segments shop off-price. Now, the need a deal shopper needs value especially at opening price points and on moderate brands, and as we said before, that shopper is very important to us. In your question, you kind of referenced noise and, I would say, investor concerns about those lower income consumers. We actually think that at this point, that noise, those concerns may be overblown. We think that at this point, those concerns are mostly in the rear--they concern a phenomenon that's really in the rear view mirror. In 2022, and we certainly felt this, those lower income shoppers were crushed by the combination of the higher cost of living and the end of pandemic-era benefits; but our view is that since then, in other words over the last five quarters, discretionary income for that demographic appears to have stabilized. Now, that consumer is still fragile and we saw evidence of that with the delayed tax refunds in February, but inflation has come down and it looks like real incomes at the lower end are not shrinking in the way that they were in 2022. We're not saying that the situation for this customer is getting better yet - they're not bouncing back, but our assessment is that the situation doesn't seem to be getting any worse. Coming back to your question, how to explain our strong trend in March and April, I think that there are two factors that explain that trend. Number one, the catch-up in tax refunds in that period meant that lower income shoppers had some extra money in their pockets. In the last couple of years, that shopper has really come to appreciate Burlington as a great place to find value, so it's natural that they would come to us when they have some extra money to spend. The second factor is unrelated to lower income shoppers. When we look at selling, especially on better brands at higher price points, we believe that we are seeing--we're benefiting from more trade-down traffic in our stores, and that's helping to support our comp trend. In 2022, it felt as if moderate to high income shoppers were somewhat insulated from the impacts of inflation, perhaps they had excess savings that they could tap into. But we believe that now, that demographic is also feeling the pinch - we think that's good for us. It means that those customers are shopping off-price in search of value. Good morning Lorraine, good to hear from you. Yes, we do see an opportunity to increase our mix of brands, and actually more generally, we see an opportunity to elevate our assortments. In fact, we're already seeing some success with that approach in businesses like sportswear, but we plan to lean into that opportunity more, I would say in the back half of the year. But let me spend a minute just sort of talking about the role that brands play in our business, and also addressing the last part of your question about the risks or the limits of that strategy. In off-price, brands are important, but the most critical thing by far is value. Brands are just one component of value. Fashion, quality, and of course price also drive the customer's perception of value. You can have a great brand, but if the fashion, the quality or the price are wrong, the customer isn't going to buy it, it's going to end up in the clearance run. The second point to make is that the role that the brand plays in defining value depends on the category and also depends on the customer and their price sensitivity. That's why our merchants spend a lot of time planning and styling out the whole rack and then executing our good-better-best strategy. Again, brands are important, but they're just one piece of that. I should add that calculus may be different for other retailers, depending upon their own customer profile. Okay, so with all of that as context, let me talk about where we see opportunity. As I said earlier, in this economy we believe that all shoppers are now focused on value. We know that we do--I think we do an excellent job when it comes to the low income, need a deal shopper, and let me emphasize we continue--we intend to continue to do an excellent job with those very important customers, but we think we can also do more to drive sales with trade-down or slightly higher income shoppers. When those shoppers walk in our store, they're more likely to be drawn to great deals on better brands, so as we get further into the year, you'll see more of those brands in our runs. Now as you'd expect, we'll do that selectively in businesses where it works and where brands really matter, but let me maybe finish up by maybe reinforcing the point. We see this as an \u2018and' strategy - you know, we'll go after this trade-down opportunity and we're going to continue to deliver for our core need a deal shoppers as well. Well, good morning Brooke. Thank you for the question. You're right - it does feel like a number of retailers have recently talked about reducing, sharpening or rolling back their prices. As an off-price retailer, relative value is critically important to us, so we pay close attention to what competitors are saying. That said, there are a few reasons why I think we are in pretty good shape. Firstly, many retailers raised their prices over the last few years. Now that the consumer is pushing back, it's not that surprising that some retailers are having to roll their prices back. In contrast, we have not raised prices; in fact, our average retails are lower now than they were two years ago. The reason for that is that our core customer has been under significant economic pressure since the end of 2021, so we've had to stay very, very sharp on value. In other words, I feel like we're already starting from a very strong value position. Secondly, our merchants are in our competitors' stores every week: off-price, department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce websites and other retailers. They're looking through the assortments, the styles, the prices. They're looking at what's working and what's not, and what's left in the clearance rack. As I mentioned a moment ago with merchandising 2.0, we have better visibility than we've ever had before into what's on our floor and how well it's turning. That means that we can respond very quickly if we need to make an adjustment. The third and final thing I'd say is that the guidance that we've discussed today already builds in some room in case we need to reduce mark-up later this year in order to make our values even stronger. It's worth calling out that the Q1 gross margin that we've reported today at 43.5% is a historic record for the first quarter for Burlington, it's even higher than Q1 of 2021. We're driving those margins by turning faster and taking fewer markdowns. We think we may have more favorability there, but within our guidance, we have left room in case we need to further sharpen our value and pass along that favorability to shoppers. Good morning Alex. That's a great question. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, total sales growth in Q1 was up 11% versus 2023--versus Q1 of 2023, and that itself was on top of positive 11% growth versus Q1 of 2022. Obviously those numbers heavily indicate that we are drawing incremental customers to our stores. That said, Burlington has been around for a long time and most of our new stores are opening in markets and geographies where we already have a presence, so what we're seeing in our data is that, yes, some of the shoppers walking into our stores are completely new, but many others actually shopped Burlington many years ago, maybe their mother brought them in to buy a coat back in the day. But what's exciting is that when they walk into our one of our stores today, it's as if they're walking into a completely different retailer. It feels like a new Burlington, and to all intends and purposes these are essentially new customers for us, so yes, one way or another we believe that our new store opening program is attracting new customers to Burlington. On the last part of your question, where are these customers coming from, I would say that there is not one single source. Of course, at a macro level we can see that there are certain retail formats, such as department stores and specialty stores, that are struggling and are losing share year-on-year. We don't have specific data, but it seems like a reasonable inference that we must be picking up some of the market share that they are losing. That said, we operate in a large fragmented and very competitive space with off-price, department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce and other retail formats, and we know from our own customer surveys that our customers cross-shop heavily in looking for the best value. The implication for us is if we offer the best value, then we can draw market share, I think from a wide range of retail competitors. Thank you. Thank you. Let me close by thanking everyone on this call for your interest in Burlington Stores. We look forward to talking to you again in August to discuss our second quarter 2024 fiscal results. Thank you for your time today."
