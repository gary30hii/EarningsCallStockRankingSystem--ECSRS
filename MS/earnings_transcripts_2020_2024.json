During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, and reported information has been adjusted and is noted in the presentation. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation. On October 2, Morgan Stanley closed its acquisition of E*TRADE, which impacts period-over-period comparisons for the firm and Wealth Management. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And I fully appreciate we're competing with a historic day here, so particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk, as we always try to be. Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4%, while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E*TRADE, received an upgrade from Moody's to A2, we're placed on review for upgrade a second time, and announced our intent to acquire Eaton Vance. Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test result, we announced the $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point. Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first let me walk you through our vision for the next decade, and outlook focused on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now done since, I believe, 2012. Let's turn to slide three. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress, and delivering strong results when markets are active. 2020 for sure tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs. We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014. Turn to slide number four. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth with several strategic acquisitions. In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. Then, in 2020, we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. Combining with E*TRADE positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable, economic way. E*TRADE's technology, products, and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E*TRADE serves a younger demographic, who are on average over 10 years younger than those we have historically served, and who we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex. With Eaton Vance, we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform, and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution. Please turn to slide number five. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing, and stability, our firm is now at an inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all three of our business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share, expanding and deepening our client relationships, realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage, and finally, returning capital to our shareholders. Please turn to slide six. Scale in our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver, gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis, our wealth and asset management platforms is among the largest globally, with over $5 trillion in combined assets. Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet, as you can see on slide seven. Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage, and are capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020, international securities generated over $300 million of revenues from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management in turn gained $20 billion of client assets, and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments all from Institutional Securities referrals. Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities, on slide eight. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth coupled with risk and expense discipline was an operating margin of 35%. Turn to slide nine, which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E*TRADE, we are now a top three player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances, and each presents unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households. If we look at E*TRADE, on slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records across all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled, and net new assets more than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy E*TRADE was indeed the right one. On slide 11, we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets this year new to our firm, that's 6% of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis. We've invested heavily over the years building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology, and building new businesses. And the addition of E*TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable. And while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, and this was likely the high end of what is a likely range, we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels. On slide 12, every year for the past decade, our revenues have increased. And with E*TRADE, our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That was compared to just 2% only four years ago. Let's talk about Investment Management, on slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion, and both MSIM and Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%. We're really excited about this transaction and the integration planning is going well. Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong, with increasing assets under management through the end of December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter. Slide 14 shows the power of our wealth and investment management platforms when taken together. On a pro forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets have more double the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly advance-driven business model, revenue on these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand-side of the page, is materially higher than our three larger competitors. Now, let's turn to slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side with additional liquidity and deposits we have added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals. And there are outlined in little bit detail on the right-hand side of the slide. Now turning to 16, expense discipline is a fundamental tenant of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just on 70% this past year. And obviously, that has driven the pretax profit expansion. So, our fifth growth driver is highlighted on Page 17. Over the past several years we have consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital. We are excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve. I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives which are shown on slide 18. While this year will be a transition year as we observed two major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and frankly our belief is that wealth management would generate a margin over 30%. By 2022 and in that period, we expect to range from 26 to 30% as we continue to work through the E*TRADE integration. We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth that will balance this with discipline. In so doing, we keep our long term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69 to 72 over the next two years. Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also, of course, on distribution. In the meantime, we raised our two-year target to the range of 14 to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now we fully expect to achieve these as stated. That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to John who is going to go through the fourth and annual results, and together we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you.\nJonathan Pruzan: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $48 billion in 2020. Records both with and without E*TRADE saw a continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets, incredible volatility, and consistent client engagement across all three businesses drove results. Excluding E*TRADE integration related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and full year respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58 respectively. We continue to deliver on operating leverage in 2020 led by institutional securities. Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 50% driven by increased volume related expenses and higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business and development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full-year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the full-year up 16% resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73 in 20 -- now to the businesses, in institutional securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year. Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced and clients remained active up until the week of Christmas. Investment banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full-year, 26% higher in 2019 driven by record underwriting revenues, particularly equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening of markets beginning with debt and rescue financings, next with equity, and very recently leveraged loans and corporate M&A financing. Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade, generating revenues of $2.3 billion, 46% higher versus the prior year driven by record underwriting and advisory results with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates. Overall, the investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. The pace of M&A announcement has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in healthcare and technology and follow on activity notably in the Americas and Asia. After a record breaking year and investment grade and high yield debt markets, strategic activity should support increased acquisition related financing. In equity sales and trading, we remain number one globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full-year revenues of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade. This year's market backdrop was unprecedented and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity, emits elevated volatility, and a double-digit increase in global market volumes. Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full-year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade increasing 59% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid offer spreads. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion, increased 31% year-over-year, results in the quarter and full-year were led by credit and foreign exchange, for the full-year Asia showed particular strengths. Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plan. Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter, as we continue to support our clients while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline, and it's now closed to pre-pandemic levels. After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first three quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4. ISG provisions were $14 million, while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by hotels. While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We de-risk this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter, and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains stable and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline. Turning to wealth management, on October 2nd, we closed our acquisition of E*TRADE. This quarter's results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E*TRADE revenues in transactional and NII making comparisons to prior periods are difficult. So I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on page seven regarding the combined business. In the quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, excluding integration related expenses of 231 million. The PBT margin was 22.9% and full-year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong, reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity. We saw record fee-based flows of $77 billion for the year, and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth in 2020, and loans are nearly $100 billion. Asset quality continues to be excellent and loans in forbearance are under $400 million down from approximately $2 billion at the end of Q1. Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E*TRADE and are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter and on a pro forma basis over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisors. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future. In the quarter, asset management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both advisor led and self directed channels. Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with E*TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes the purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This year NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates. On funding synergies, we onboarded approximately $4 billion of deposits that were previously swept-off E*TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4 and we expect to onboard approximately $20 billion in Q1. As we invest these deposits and shed higher costs wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised higher funding benefits in NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions selected in Q2. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII. Lastly on rates we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near-term. However, we'll benefit from the eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E*TRADE increases our U.S. banks sensitivity to rates and a 100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII prior to the estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition. We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over three years with approximately 40% to be realized this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured, 2021 we'll be exiting the E*TRADE branches consolidating our bank entities and integrating HR and finance systems and we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies during the year. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter representing the second highest quarterly level in over a decade. For the full-year, revenues were $3.7 billion in line with the prior-period but reflecting a greater contribution for more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest. Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion. The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net flows of $41 billion for the year, and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%. We're excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance across businesses and strategies Eaton Vance's assets under management across excuse me increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong and their momentum continues. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.1 trillion and standardized RWA's increased to $454 billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E*TRADE. Our standardized CET-1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 17.4%. Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full-year respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in and around 23% which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. We're pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipeline, engaged institutional and retail clients, and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives. With that, we will now open the line to questions. [26:20]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start on the net new asset disclosure that you guys provided here this quarter for the first time, thanks for that, it's very, very helpful. It seems as though the net new asset growth, the organic growth profile in the wealth business accelerated here in 2020. What do you think is driving that? Is that a capturing a greater wallet share of existing clients, is that an expansion of the client base? And it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions. Is -- do you have an estimate of what that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate, because I believe most of the other competitors disclose it net of those fees, so just want to try to make a like-for-like? Thank you.\nJames Gorman: Well, let me start, and Jon would talk about some of the disclosure stuff, and as you point out, Brennan, it's the first time I think we have done it in many, many years. And we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth. I mean we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with frankly, in absolute dollars, modest assets. And we're able to bring in $200 billion in a year. Now, part of that is obviously it's pro forma based, part of that is if you look at what E*TRADE is doing, they're doing great. Part of it is if you're in net attrition of financial advisors you will be in net attrition of assets on those advisors [indiscernible] for the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this we're not in net attrition, which is interesting given the IFA channels continue to grow, but they're not growing from us. So we're keeping assets of our advisors. We're gaining assets from new advisors. Through the workplace initiatives, through Solium, and E*TRADES we are gaining assets from the conversion and keeping those assets at high rate than we were. So it's a whole variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm. And it's no single thing. I do think 6%, that's a -- as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number, but it's a long way from the 2% or the 3%-4% we're operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2%, but maybe 6%, that feels high. And certainly best-in-class to what the Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the disclosures.\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes, so the two critical exposures, the net new assets and then the fee-based flows, and you can see from the footnotes on the net new assets, which is a concept of the assets that we bring into the organization net of the outflows, that does not exclude the fees. You can figure and see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure, about $10 billion or $11 billion. The fee-based flows do exclude that, as it is a function about how much fee-based assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset base. Hopefully that clarifies the question. And I think for us the net new assets, given the different business models across the different business models it reflects, most people don't have the level of asset-based fees that we do, and we thought it was appropriate to disclose it then.\nBrennan Hawken: Yes. It's -- no, that's great. That's very helpful clarification. And agreed the growth rate looks robust. I mean you regularly hear about how the traditional wealth management firms are just the providers of share. And certainly a mid single-digit growth rate does not suggest you're providing or ceding share to anybody. So, agreed there. And then for my follow-up, sort of a related question, one of the things that a lot of people and myself included think is one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the wealth business is the stock plan business where you really just have like a strong position competitively. And you flag a lot of in the deck, which is really helpful. You talk about the retention opportunity of the 15%-plus which is what E*TRADE has pointed to historically. Are you -- what's the plan to integrate the stock plan platforms? How long do you think that might take? And is it right, when we think about the opportunity set, you've got these $435 billion of unvested assets, my guess is that's the opportunity set. About how much of that tends to vest per year, is it about a quarter or 30%, and it's right to think about that as evergreen, right, like invest and then they're replaced with new awards in subsequent year? Sorry about the multipart question, but I think it's an important one. Thank you.\nJonathan Pruzan: That's okay. So, we have integrated the sales team. We're going to market through our corporate clients with a consolidated sales effort. As you would expect, we're going to be very mindful of the integration of these platforms. I would highlight that they were certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small companies, private companies, and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together. You're right, the existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets, and roughly five million participants. Our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have, and therefore the number of participants. And we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the E*TRADE transaction, so we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel. And then lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vest each year, I think that's a pretax number, so clearly there's tax impacting that. But as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, you've clearly gained share this quarter of the year in capital markets and trading. Aside from your gaining share, what is your outlook for the industry wallet? As you know, it shrunk in trading for a decade, and now it may or may not have turned more permanently. So, some banks say we're planning for 2019 levels for trading, some think it can maintain this pace, some say it's in-between. Kind of where do you fall out, and why, what do you see as the structural changes?\nJames Gorman: Mike, it's very difficult to say. I mean just look at what we've been through in the last 12 months, and look at activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter, and then where do you finish. So, clearly, there is a lot of activity in the market. There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Our rates remain very low. I think the global economies are recovering. And I think the vaccine; if we get in the U.S. to a million doses a day for the next 150 days would be spectacular. So, there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance, new IPOs coming, recapitalizations of different kinds, raising debt. So there's a lot of market activity I think in the reasonable near-term. Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds, less than 50%, I think. But who knows, I mean the year has started off strong. And we count them one day at a time. And the year has started off strong, the markets are active, the economies are recovering globally, new administration has come in. It looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So, I am quite optimistic about it. I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. Our fixed income franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Our equities bounced and retain their number one spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, that the banking revenue is about $2 billion for the quarter, there is a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. So, I'm pretty optimistic. I mean I can't put an exact number on it, but I certainly don't feel like we're going to make a major back-step at all here.\nMike Mayo: On that last comment, in terms of backlogs, are they up quarter-over-quarter, near record, down?\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes, generally, I think from my comments, Mike, we describe them as healthy across all products and all regions, with IPOs as a standout. As I said, M&A activity dialogues very active, pipeline very healthy. So, as James said, a very constructive start to the year with very healthy pipeline.\nMike Mayo: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nChristian Bolu: Thank you, and good morning, James and Jon. Maybe back on Wealth Management organic growth, and again echo the earlier comments. Really appreciate the new information. But for James, you seem to be really playing down the 6% this year as not sustainable. So I guess can you just maybe help us understand what exactly was elevated in 2020, was just overall industry was elevated, was there something more specific to Morgan Stanley like higher recruiting? I'm just trying to understand why you think it was elevated. And then maybe more importantly, just looking forward, give us a sense of what you think the business can do sustainably, as sort of range for organic growth that you would expect for the business. Thank you.\nJames Gorman: Christian, you probably know me well enough by now to know I'm not going to project a trend line based upon one point of data. Listen, we have had a decade of been growing net new assets around 2%-3% and then 3%-4%. Clearly E*TRADE has fast-growing asset growth capability, that adds enormously. I think net positive financial advisor, our actual numbers of financial advisors went up this quarter, I think for the first time for years. So, I just trend to the conservative until I see more data. And do I think it's going to fall back to 2%, not at all. But if we could lock in 6% for the next 10 years, and we'd be bringing -- we're bringing $200 billion a year. I read about a lot of these online players that have got $20 billion in total. And we're brining in $20 billion every five weeks, so we're effectively creating these companies every five weeks. Now, if it's going to be 4.5%, 5.5%, I don't know. I just -- my instinct is 6% in $4 trillion is a lot of assets to bring in. And I think it's doable. I'm not saying it's not doable. But I'm not projecting that. And I wouldn't want to guide you to that. On the other hand, I don't think we're going back to where we -- I think we've got a different kind of company. The reason that the title of this presentation is called Morgan Stanley, an Inflection Point, the Next Decade of Growth is if there's one message I would like people to take away from it is we're in the growth phase of this company for the next decade. We've been in, as I said, from the crisis forward, sort of fragility, then healing, then stability. And we are unambiguously in a growth phase. We have the capital to invest in our business, we're gaining share across our businesses, we've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency. And I believe we're in a growth phase in this company, and one of those indicators to growth will be very strong net new asset growth.\nChristian Bolu: Fair enough. Maybe switching over to capital, with the stock now trading well above book value, how are you thinking about prioritizing buyback versus dividends? I think in the past you have spoken to an aspirational target of paying out all of wealth and asset management earnings as a dividend. So maybe just some updated thoughts around how you're thinking about that prospect, and again, buyback versus dividend conversation here?\nJames Gorman: Well, the third leg to that conversation, very importantly, is investing in the business. If we're going to grow, let's pretend we're growing, I don't know, net earnings of $10 billion, and we're paying out dividends at the moment of about $2.5 billion. So if we were doing a buyback this year of $10 billion we're only eating into our buffer $2.5 billion a year, we're not going to chip away at much for 17.4% and I think the threshold is 13.2%. I'm looking at Jon.\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes.\nJames Gorman: 13.2%. Let's assume we carry, what, a 50-100 basis point buffer on our SCB, so let's assume we want to run at 14.2%, we're at 17.4%. We've clearly got some room to move, obviously, we've got the Eaton Vance move coming in, which affects those numbers about 100 basis points. So, as I think about it, I've described this before, half our company asset sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings, and we could clearly move the dividend higher and we'll, once the regulators permit that we have, clearly we have the capacity. On the book value, yes, I would have preferred to be buying stocks last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that, but I'm not troubled by buying a little of book value. And I don't think we can be 2Q we have 1.8 billion-1.9 billion shares outstanding, obviously through the issuance from the deal. So, I'd like to get us back to 1.5 billion type range over the next few years and we've got the capital, on things we can invest, $10 billion, $15 billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns, we expect to generate. So it's a mix of all three. But clearly, we like to see more action on the dividend. Clearly, we're going to be aggressively buying back and consistently and clearly we have capacity to increase our investment in the core businesses.\nChristian Bolu: Great, high-class problem. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Your line is muted.\nSteven Chubak: Sorry, can you hear me? My apologies for that. I just want to start-off with a question on funding NII. I appreciate the disclosure on funding optimization and the drivers of some of the improved synergies from the initial guidance. I'm curious how much room there is to cut deposit costs further, it looks like your wealth management deposit costs are 24 bps, it's just running well above peers. And just a clarifying question regarding the NII guidance, is the growth you're contemplating in '21? Is that versus the 4Q '20 base, which reflects the full impact of the deal? Or was that a guide versus full-year 2020?\nJonathan Pruzan: I'll do the first, last question first, which is that it was based on the fourth quarter, so sort of using a fourth quarter annualized as the right base to be thinking about again, we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio. You're right; our deposit costs were 24 basis points which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw an improvement as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits, obviously at a lower rate, basically a one basis points relative to our wholesale, that costs about 100 basis points. So part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding, CDs and other wholesale funding with the off balance sheet deposits that we're going to bring back on balance sheet. So we started the quarter, I think about 65% of our funding and the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%, we would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off. That's obviously based on the maturities. So we continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with the incremental deposits from E*TRADE.\nSteven Chubak: No, that's great. And just for my follow-up, big picture question, James, if you'll indulge me, I was hoping you could help us reconcile versus your prior target of 15% to 17%. What rate market and capital assumptions are underpinning your 17% plus ambition, and I guess if we started to think about the inflection and growth that you cited and maybe even some tailwinds from normalization, just higher rates, which would be more than 100 basis point benefit, greater realization of revenue synergy opportunities, further progress on the SCB, the direction of travel, there's been quite favorable. The 17% plus longer-term still feels somewhat conservative. I'm wondering from your perspective, do you see even in upper teens are 20% plus ROTCE as a reasonable long-term ambition just given the significant transformation that's underway.\nJames Gorman: You're beginning to replace Mike Mayo's. He usually asks me that. What about the plus? What's wrong with plus? Plus means more.\nSteven Chubak: You drive a truck with that range.\nJames Gorman: Yes, listen, I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't try and model too much science into this. This is an expression of our aspiration, and as I said also happens to be out belief. It's not just Disney Land. We believe we will deliver these numbers, and for some of the reasons you listed, rates being one of them, obviously has a huge impact on this firm, but look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were, these obviously become very plausible, whether it should be 17 plus, 18 plus, 19 plus. We said to you three years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17 plus ROTCE, you know, we are also planning. So I'm very comfortable with these numbers. If we could achieve this, then obviously the stock should be trading much higher than it is today. And embedded in it, we do some math, we stopped with that budget, we stopped with that operating performance in 2018, 2019, 2020 look at our budget projections. We do sensitivities around revenues. We understand what our comp and non-comp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration costs that have got to work through, and then the synergies of the various businesses. And then we of course look at the capital question, which I discussed earlier I think with Christian on buyback dividend or reinvestment in the business, and what our RWA growth is going to be in ISG and how that affects the CT1, and you put all of that in a big washing machine and out spits a number with a plus on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. James, I wonder if we could look at slide 14 and talk to something that comes up a bunch. You show your 5.4 trillion pro forma. If you look at that fee rate, there is only one other peer on that top 10 that has a fee rate equal or better than yours. And I think it's a good thing, but this comes up plenty. So I'd love to hear you talk about it. And the sustainability of that fee rate, I don't see price pressure in the wealth management business, but people ask on it all the time. Just curious to get your thought process over the coming years and what is kind of embedded in those, your immediate and long-term targets implicitly with that? Thanks.\nJames Gorman: I don't think you're going to see price compression of any significance across the wealth/res management platforms. It's really functioning a blend of asset types. So, for example, the wealthy of the clients, if you have clients with a $100 million dollars, they're not paying 58 basis points, they're probably paying I don't know, closer to 10 basis points or something, a client with a million dollars is being close at a $100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets. Obviously, some of the E*TRADE active trading clients have got high velocity on them. They're going to have higher basis point numbers and a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort of peel away what is going on under the numbers, but you brought a question, do I see price compression across wealth management? No, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking, lending and deposit product. On the asset management side I mean, listen if you driving performance in the active side, you can generate, you can hold your fees as they are. The underperformers lose their assets quickly when they lose their fees. So I'm not terribly bothered about, and if you knew the names of the three above it, you'll probably get some, there is a reason, they are more index-oriented, it's a different business model. Now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of assets, but we pay a higher revenue comp structure for Solium assets, but it's not exactly 30, 40, 50 basis point win as you know obviously.\nGlenn Schorr: Understood. Why don't we hear your words? Thanks. And then maybe if we could just bridge the gap, I think I know the answer to this too, but this was a pretty strong environment, you consolidated each -- the adjusted margin and wealth management of 24% of the medium term target - two year target at 26 to 30. How do we get inside the range without the help of rates, because the fed theoretically is on hold for a few years?\nJames Gorman: Yes, the business is growing. We had some additional expenses this year. For example, we made more contributions to our role, philanthropic and charitable efforts given what is going on with COVID, that cost is distributed across the businesses. We paid a one-time bonus to all employees owning less than I think $150,000 who don't receive bonuses, given the headcount and wealth management that disproportionately picks up business. So there is always a few things going on that, a point of margin is worth about $45 million a quarter I think if I am doing my maths right, $18 billion, 180 million, so something like that. So it's not small numbers can move it around a 0.02, but I think with increased growth, increased efficiency, better conversion of the assets more as suppose in generating this average 58 basis points is how you bounce between the sort of 20 -- what did we say 24 to 30 range -- 26 to 30. Depending on the environment, I mean, we've started the strong that probably helps the point of that held up, there you go.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks, good morning. First question just want to come back to some of the questions on organic growth and I liked the slide nine that shows $8 trillion in assets held away, essentially making the point that you already have the customer reach. And so I'm just trying to think about whether you view kind of all of that is potential wallet that you can go after or set another way. Are there any products that maybe you don't line up with $8 trillion, and then as the firm becomes more connected through technology, which I think you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years? How do you think about your strategies to connect with greater percentage of that you call it $8 trillion. I know every business has a little bit of a different, call it sales process, but are there new strategies or even financial incentives that you can think about to really accelerate the penetration into that?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. I'll give that a crack and we're not naive. We don't expect to have a 100% of the wallet of all of our clients. So clearly, we don't expect them to bring in all 8 trillion over time, but there is significant overlap as you note in these channels and in these wealth figures. We continue as you saw through the net new assets as James mentioned, a lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisors advise their clients. And we've seen people bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels on the workplace. I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets. And then over time growing the relationships, self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E*TRADE platform as their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice. We're clearly going to capture that top part of the funnel with the FA led model that we have. So again, a real opportunity and I liked the way you described it, just look at the numbers 2.5 million households, almost 5 million participants in 6.7 million households, the breadth and reach of the platform is quite large and there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from. In terms of good activity, as you can imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need with the E*TRADE acquisition we bring on, incremental digital capabilities, and as you can imagine this year, we're spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients. We're going to pilot around lead generation, we've defined the advisor group who is going to work with new clients, got scoring systems, we've got artificial intelligence, trying to help predict what people are going to want and need, and next best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made, plus the digital from wealth and we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Thanks, Jon. Just a follow-up here just on the core expense structure and trying to think about some of the benefits of 2020 with the pandemic that were deflationary, it would seem that some of those benefits roll-off. There's some inflationary aspects in the 2021, kind of in a core basis. But longer-term, obviously I think we've learned a lot about the businesses through the past 12 months and opportunities potentially to derive some longer-term savings, or maybe core deflation in the expense structure. So I'm just, love to get some thoughts around how you guys are thinking about areas or opportunities to maybe drive more expense out of the system based on what you've learned over the last 12 months?\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes, I would say we're still learning; crisis is not over. We clearly are hopeful around the rollout of the vaccine. I think there are going to be some takeaways around some of the digital client experiences that we've been able to do the work from home that we've been able to do, but I think it's little early to start making those decisions. Let's get through the crisis first.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. The strategic update and growth outlook are always helpful, just on the efficiency ratio, given the 70% level in '20 and realized strong revenues in this environment, but E*TRADE and Eaton Vance operating at a better ratio, I think it's longer-term Wealth Management margin improving maybe 600 basis points, just what drives the conservative outlook like, are there areas that you want to assess significantly, either to continue to drive the growth, or there is potential improvement on that 70%?\nJames Gorman: Listen, I think we said under 70%, after two years. So, I don't think that's conservative. We were -- Mike, we're at 79%, just a few years ago. And when I started, we were much higher. So the long-term position is we'll run this place with a 30% margin plus, what happens in the next two years with the bounce around the markets, I don't know, maybe we're too conservative in the short run, but it doesn't change our behavior, I guess is what I would tell you, we are very determined right, this company for growth and for efficiency and for return. So it's been unambiguous for a decade now. So it doesn't change our behavior at all. It's just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a minimum to achieve in this time period. And that's what we try and put in the two-year period, the longer-term we're much more aggressive, but it was relative two years this year, as I said, if you annualize the way this year started up we'll do better than the efficiency rate.\nMichael Carrier: Yes, that makes sense. Jon, just one clarification on the wealth management, you gave a lot of numbers on the outlook just given the E*TRADE deal, I just wanted to clarify on the funding benefit, did you say 80% in '21 and most of that by 2Q. And then same thing on the expense synergy, I heard a 25% and a 40%. So I just wanted to make sure I had the right number in terms of what you're recognizing in '21? Thanks.\nJonathan Pruzan: I think all those numbers that you gave are correct. The funding synergies are really from this transition from the off balance sheet, the on balance sheet and the run-off of the wholesale deposits. So again, that use more towards the back half in that, 80% that's when you get into the second quarter, you'll be using a quarter number, not a full-year benefit number, and then 25% on costs and approximately 40% on the integration costs. Also, yes, those are the right numbers.\nMichael Carrier: Got it, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. If your line is muted, please unmute.\nJeremy Sigee: Sorry, apologies for that. I thought the comments on net interest income outlook and wealth management were very helpful. And I just wondered if I could get you to talk in a similar way about the asset management fees and the transaction revenues in wealth management because versus my estimates, I thought asset management was a bit below maybe that's a lag with the rising AUM, but obviously transaction revenues were very strong. So, could you talk about those two revenue drivers within wealth management, please?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. On the assessment management fees line, obviously the exit rate, as you know we get the benefit now for the full year of the $1.5 trillion in fee-based assets have average effect and exit effect in terms of 2021. So now, at $1.5 trillion asset, we also have the benefit of the net new assets that we bring in over 2021. Though on an average basis, we would expect continued growth obviously in that line. We had over 10% year-over-year in that asset management fees. And then on transactional, it's really going to around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter, we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that that was helped by the DCP number which presumably may or may not repeat next year. But that the margin on that revenue, as we have talked about in the past, is virtually zero. And so, transactional generally has been declining. We now have the E*TRADE platform inside Morgan Stanley, so the commissions based on their options trading as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number. So, it will be at a new level. But generally that's going to be driven by volume-related activity. And we'll have to see how it plays out recognizing the first 11 days of have been pretty good.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. And just to follow up on the acquisition expenses. You sort of break out the amounts of acquisition related expenses in here, I just wondered if you could talk to us about the split between sort of restructuring and also ratio of intangibles? You said you are going to be amortizing the intangibles. I just wondered about the amounts of that and where we see it.\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. Well, I'll just give you a few. So -- again, we issued $11 billion of equity or about $230 million shares, generated $7.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles. You'll see that in the first couple of pages of the supplement. Of that goodwill and intangibles, about $3 billion is going to be amortized at a rough rate of about 15 years, so about $200 million. And that would be allocated in the non-comps in the wealth segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe we could talk a little bit the momentum at E*TRADE. I just want to confirm the numbers. If I looked at their second quarter sort of retail client base is around $5.8 million self-directed clients. And then I think in December, the fourth quarter was up to $6.7 million. Are those apples to apples? And if so, that implies quite a bit of net new account growth of close to 900,000. That's pretty good momentum. And just maybe you could discuss what's driving that and how you feel about that going forward?\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes. I mean I think we tried to lay that out. As I said on page seven, you can see what pre closing -- so, the September 30 number shows the self-directed assets within Morgan Stanley before the deal closed. So, yes, the growth has really been in the E*TRADE channel. Your number of about 900,000 is accurate. Again I think from our disclosure going forward, we had to conform sort of definitions and whatnot, but they have had real strong growth with new clients given the activity level this year. It's a number you'll be able to track whether the self-directed channel is growing through that number going forward. I don't think we're going to be explicitly disclosing net new clients within the self-directed channel as we try to integrate and bring these two businesses together.\nJim Mitchell: Right, I imagine that's better growth than anticipated. Does that give you even more confidence in the revenue synergies from E*TRADE?\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes.\nJames Gorman: Yes and yes.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And I fully appreciate we're competing with a historic day here, so particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk, as we always try to be. Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4%, while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E*TRADE, received an upgrade from Moody's to A2, we're placed on review for upgrade a second time, and announced our intent to acquire Eaton Vance. Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test result, we announced the $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point. Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first let me walk you through our vision for the next decade, and outlook focused on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now done since, I believe, 2012. Let's turn to slide three. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress, and delivering strong results when markets are active. 2020 for sure tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs. We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014. Turn to slide number four. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth with several strategic acquisitions. In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. Then, in 2020, we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. Combining with E*TRADE positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable, economic way. E*TRADE's technology, products, and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E*TRADE serves a younger demographic, who are on average over 10 years younger than those we have historically served, and who we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex. With Eaton Vance, we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform, and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution. Please turn to slide number five. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing, and stability, our firm is now at an inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all three of our business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share, expanding and deepening our client relationships, realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage, and finally, returning capital to our shareholders. Please turn to slide six. Scale in our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver, gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis, our wealth and asset management platforms is among the largest globally, with over $5 trillion in combined assets. Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet, as you can see on slide seven. Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage, and are capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020, international securities generated over $300 million of revenues from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management in turn gained $20 billion of client assets, and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments all from Institutional Securities referrals. Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities, on slide eight. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth coupled with risk and expense discipline was an operating margin of 35%. Turn to slide nine, which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E*TRADE, we are now a top three player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances, and each presents unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households. If we look at E*TRADE, on slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records across all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled, and net new assets more than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy E*TRADE was indeed the right one. On slide 11, we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets this year new to our firm, that's 6% of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis. We've invested heavily over the years building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology, and building new businesses. And the addition of E*TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable. And while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, and this was likely the high end of what is a likely range, we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels. On slide 12, every year for the past decade, our revenues have increased. And with E*TRADE, our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That was compared to just 2% only four years ago. Let's talk about Investment Management, on slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion, and both MSIM and Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%. We're really excited about this transaction and the integration planning is going well. Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong, with increasing assets under management through the end of December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter. Slide 14 shows the power of our wealth and investment management platforms when taken together. On a pro forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets have more double the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly advance-driven business model, revenue on these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand-side of the page, is materially higher than our three larger competitors. Now, let's turn to slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side with additional liquidity and deposits we have added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals. And there are outlined in little bit detail on the right-hand side of the slide. Now turning to 16, expense discipline is a fundamental tenant of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just on 70% this past year. And obviously, that has driven the pretax profit expansion. So, our fifth growth driver is highlighted on Page 17. Over the past several years we have consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital. We are excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve. I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives which are shown on slide 18. While this year will be a transition year as we observed two major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and frankly our belief is that wealth management would generate a margin over 30%. By 2022 and in that period, we expect to range from 26 to 30% as we continue to work through the E*TRADE integration. We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth that will balance this with discipline. In so doing, we keep our long term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69 to 72 over the next two years. Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also, of course, on distribution. In the meantime, we raised our two-year target to the range of 14 to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now we fully expect to achieve these as stated. That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to John who is going to go through the fourth and annual results, and together we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you. Well, let me start, and Jon would talk about some of the disclosure stuff, and as you point out, Brennan, it's the first time I think we have done it in many, many years. And we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth. I mean we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with frankly, in absolute dollars, modest assets. And we're able to bring in $200 billion in a year. Now, part of that is obviously it's pro forma based, part of that is if you look at what E*TRADE is doing, they're doing great. Part of it is if you're in net attrition of financial advisors you will be in net attrition of assets on those advisors [indiscernible] for the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this we're not in net attrition, which is interesting given the IFA channels continue to grow, but they're not growing from us. So we're keeping assets of our advisors. We're gaining assets from new advisors. Through the workplace initiatives, through Solium, and E*TRADES we are gaining assets from the conversion and keeping those assets at high rate than we were. So it's a whole variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm. And it's no single thing. I do think 6%, that's a -- as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number, but it's a long way from the 2% or the 3%-4% we're operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2%, but maybe 6%, that feels high. And certainly best-in-class to what the Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the disclosures. Mike, it's very difficult to say. I mean just look at what we've been through in the last 12 months, and look at activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter, and then where do you finish. So, clearly, there is a lot of activity in the market. There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Our rates remain very low. I think the global economies are recovering. And I think the vaccine; if we get in the U.S. to a million doses a day for the next 150 days would be spectacular. So, there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance, new IPOs coming, recapitalizations of different kinds, raising debt. So there's a lot of market activity I think in the reasonable near-term. Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds, less than 50%, I think. But who knows, I mean the year has started off strong. And we count them one day at a time. And the year has started off strong, the markets are active, the economies are recovering globally, new administration has come in. It looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So, I am quite optimistic about it. I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. Our fixed income franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Our equities bounced and retain their number one spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, that the banking revenue is about $2 billion for the quarter, there is a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. So, I'm pretty optimistic. I mean I can't put an exact number on it, but I certainly don't feel like we're going to make a major back-step at all here. Christian, you probably know me well enough by now to know I'm not going to project a trend line based upon one point of data. Listen, we have had a decade of been growing net new assets around 2%-3% and then 3%-4%. Clearly E*TRADE has fast-growing asset growth capability, that adds enormously. I think net positive financial advisor, our actual numbers of financial advisors went up this quarter, I think for the first time for years. So, I just trend to the conservative until I see more data. And do I think it's going to fall back to 2%, not at all. But if we could lock in 6% for the next 10 years, and we'd be bringing -- we're bringing $200 billion a year. I read about a lot of these online players that have got $20 billion in total. And we're brining in $20 billion every five weeks, so we're effectively creating these companies every five weeks. Now, if it's going to be 4.5%, 5.5%, I don't know. I just -- my instinct is 6% in $4 trillion is a lot of assets to bring in. And I think it's doable. I'm not saying it's not doable. But I'm not projecting that. And I wouldn't want to guide you to that. On the other hand, I don't think we're going back to where we -- I think we've got a different kind of company. The reason that the title of this presentation is called Morgan Stanley, an Inflection Point, the Next Decade of Growth is if there's one message I would like people to take away from it is we're in the growth phase of this company for the next decade. We've been in, as I said, from the crisis forward, sort of fragility, then healing, then stability. And we are unambiguously in a growth phase. We have the capital to invest in our business, we're gaining share across our businesses, we've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency. And I believe we're in a growth phase in this company, and one of those indicators to growth will be very strong net new asset growth. Well, the third leg to that conversation, very importantly, is investing in the business. If we're going to grow, let's pretend we're growing, I don't know, net earnings of $10 billion, and we're paying out dividends at the moment of about $2.5 billion. So if we were doing a buyback this year of $10 billion we're only eating into our buffer $2.5 billion a year, we're not going to chip away at much for 17.4% and I think the threshold is 13.2%. I'm looking at Jon. 13.2%. Let's assume we carry, what, a 50-100 basis point buffer on our SCB, so let's assume we want to run at 14.2%, we're at 17.4%. We've clearly got some room to move, obviously, we've got the Eaton Vance move coming in, which affects those numbers about 100 basis points. So, as I think about it, I've described this before, half our company asset sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings, and we could clearly move the dividend higher and we'll, once the regulators permit that we have, clearly we have the capacity. On the book value, yes, I would have preferred to be buying stocks last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that, but I'm not troubled by buying a little of book value. And I don't think we can be 2Q we have 1.8 billion-1.9 billion shares outstanding, obviously through the issuance from the deal. So, I'd like to get us back to 1.5 billion type range over the next few years and we've got the capital, on things we can invest, $10 billion, $15 billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns, we expect to generate. So it's a mix of all three. But clearly, we like to see more action on the dividend. Clearly, we're going to be aggressively buying back and consistently and clearly we have capacity to increase our investment in the core businesses. You're beginning to replace Mike Mayo's. He usually asks me that. What about the plus? What's wrong with plus? Plus means more. Yes, listen, I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't try and model too much science into this. This is an expression of our aspiration, and as I said also happens to be out belief. It's not just Disney Land. We believe we will deliver these numbers, and for some of the reasons you listed, rates being one of them, obviously has a huge impact on this firm, but look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were, these obviously become very plausible, whether it should be 17 plus, 18 plus, 19 plus. We said to you three years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17 plus ROTCE, you know, we are also planning. So I'm very comfortable with these numbers. If we could achieve this, then obviously the stock should be trading much higher than it is today. And embedded in it, we do some math, we stopped with that budget, we stopped with that operating performance in 2018, 2019, 2020 look at our budget projections. We do sensitivities around revenues. We understand what our comp and non-comp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration costs that have got to work through, and then the synergies of the various businesses. And then we of course look at the capital question, which I discussed earlier I think with Christian on buyback dividend or reinvestment in the business, and what our RWA growth is going to be in ISG and how that affects the CT1, and you put all of that in a big washing machine and out spits a number with a plus on it. I don't think you're going to see price compression of any significance across the wealth/res management platforms. It's really functioning a blend of asset types. So, for example, the wealthy of the clients, if you have clients with a $100 million dollars, they're not paying 58 basis points, they're probably paying I don't know, closer to 10 basis points or something, a client with a million dollars is being close at a $100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets. Obviously, some of the E*TRADE active trading clients have got high velocity on them. They're going to have higher basis point numbers and a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort of peel away what is going on under the numbers, but you brought a question, do I see price compression across wealth management? No, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking, lending and deposit product. On the asset management side I mean, listen if you driving performance in the active side, you can generate, you can hold your fees as they are. The underperformers lose their assets quickly when they lose their fees. So I'm not terribly bothered about, and if you knew the names of the three above it, you'll probably get some, there is a reason, they are more index-oriented, it's a different business model. Now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of assets, but we pay a higher revenue comp structure for Solium assets, but it's not exactly 30, 40, 50 basis point win as you know obviously. Yes, the business is growing. We had some additional expenses this year. For example, we made more contributions to our role, philanthropic and charitable efforts given what is going on with COVID, that cost is distributed across the businesses. We paid a one-time bonus to all employees owning less than I think $150,000 who don't receive bonuses, given the headcount and wealth management that disproportionately picks up business. So there is always a few things going on that, a point of margin is worth about $45 million a quarter I think if I am doing my maths right, $18 billion, 180 million, so something like that. So it's not small numbers can move it around a 0.02, but I think with increased growth, increased efficiency, better conversion of the assets more as suppose in generating this average 58 basis points is how you bounce between the sort of 20 -- what did we say 24 to 30 range -- 26 to 30. Depending on the environment, I mean, we've started the strong that probably helps the point of that held up, there you go. Listen, I think we said under 70%, after two years. So, I don't think that's conservative. We were -- Mike, we're at 79%, just a few years ago. And when I started, we were much higher. So the long-term position is we'll run this place with a 30% margin plus, what happens in the next two years with the bounce around the markets, I don't know, maybe we're too conservative in the short run, but it doesn't change our behavior, I guess is what I would tell you, we are very determined right, this company for growth and for efficiency and for return. So it's been unambiguous for a decade now. So it doesn't change our behavior at all. It's just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a minimum to achieve in this time period. And that's what we try and put in the two-year period, the longer-term we're much more aggressive, but it was relative two years this year, as I said, if you annualize the way this year started up we'll do better than the efficiency rate. Yes and yes."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $48 billion in 2020. Records both with and without E*TRADE saw a continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets, incredible volatility, and consistent client engagement across all three businesses drove results. Excluding E*TRADE integration related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and full year respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58 respectively. We continue to deliver on operating leverage in 2020 led by institutional securities. Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 50% driven by increased volume related expenses and higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business and development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full-year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the full-year up 16% resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73 in 20 -- now to the businesses, in institutional securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year. Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced and clients remained active up until the week of Christmas. Investment banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full-year, 26% higher in 2019 driven by record underwriting revenues, particularly equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening of markets beginning with debt and rescue financings, next with equity, and very recently leveraged loans and corporate M&A financing. Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade, generating revenues of $2.3 billion, 46% higher versus the prior year driven by record underwriting and advisory results with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates. Overall, the investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. The pace of M&A announcement has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in healthcare and technology and follow on activity notably in the Americas and Asia. After a record breaking year and investment grade and high yield debt markets, strategic activity should support increased acquisition related financing. In equity sales and trading, we remain number one globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full-year revenues of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade. This year's market backdrop was unprecedented and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity, emits elevated volatility, and a double-digit increase in global market volumes. Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full-year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade increasing 59% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid offer spreads. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion, increased 31% year-over-year, results in the quarter and full-year were led by credit and foreign exchange, for the full-year Asia showed particular strengths. Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plan. Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter, as we continue to support our clients while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline, and it's now closed to pre-pandemic levels. After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first three quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4. ISG provisions were $14 million, while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by hotels. While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We de-risk this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter, and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains stable and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline. Turning to wealth management, on October 2nd, we closed our acquisition of E*TRADE. This quarter's results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E*TRADE revenues in transactional and NII making comparisons to prior periods are difficult. So I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on page seven regarding the combined business. In the quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, excluding integration related expenses of 231 million. The PBT margin was 22.9% and full-year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong, reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity. We saw record fee-based flows of $77 billion for the year, and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth in 2020, and loans are nearly $100 billion. Asset quality continues to be excellent and loans in forbearance are under $400 million down from approximately $2 billion at the end of Q1. Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E*TRADE and are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter and on a pro forma basis over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisors. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future. In the quarter, asset management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both advisor led and self directed channels. Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with E*TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes the purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This year NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates. On funding synergies, we onboarded approximately $4 billion of deposits that were previously swept-off E*TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4 and we expect to onboard approximately $20 billion in Q1. As we invest these deposits and shed higher costs wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised higher funding benefits in NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions selected in Q2. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII. Lastly on rates we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near-term. However, we'll benefit from the eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E*TRADE increases our U.S. banks sensitivity to rates and a 100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII prior to the estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition. We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over three years with approximately 40% to be realized this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured, 2021 we'll be exiting the E*TRADE branches consolidating our bank entities and integrating HR and finance systems and we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies during the year. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter representing the second highest quarterly level in over a decade. For the full-year, revenues were $3.7 billion in line with the prior-period but reflecting a greater contribution for more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest. Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion. The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net flows of $41 billion for the year, and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%. We're excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance across businesses and strategies Eaton Vance's assets under management across excuse me increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong and their momentum continues. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.1 trillion and standardized RWA's increased to $454 billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E*TRADE. Our standardized CET-1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 17.4%. Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full-year respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in and around 23% which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. We're pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipeline, engaged institutional and retail clients, and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives. With that, we will now open the line to questions. [26:20] Yes, so the two critical exposures, the net new assets and then the fee-based flows, and you can see from the footnotes on the net new assets, which is a concept of the assets that we bring into the organization net of the outflows, that does not exclude the fees. You can figure and see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure, about $10 billion or $11 billion. The fee-based flows do exclude that, as it is a function about how much fee-based assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset base. Hopefully that clarifies the question. And I think for us the net new assets, given the different business models across the different business models it reflects, most people don't have the level of asset-based fees that we do, and we thought it was appropriate to disclose it then. That's okay. So, we have integrated the sales team. We're going to market through our corporate clients with a consolidated sales effort. As you would expect, we're going to be very mindful of the integration of these platforms. I would highlight that they were certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small companies, private companies, and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together. You're right, the existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets, and roughly five million participants. Our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have, and therefore the number of participants. And we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the E*TRADE transaction, so we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel. And then lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vest each year, I think that's a pretax number, so clearly there's tax impacting that. But as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships. Yes, generally, I think from my comments, Mike, we describe them as healthy across all products and all regions, with IPOs as a standout. As I said, M&A activity dialogues very active, pipeline very healthy. So, as James said, a very constructive start to the year with very healthy pipeline. Yes. I'll do the first, last question first, which is that it was based on the fourth quarter, so sort of using a fourth quarter annualized as the right base to be thinking about again, we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio. You're right; our deposit costs were 24 basis points which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw an improvement as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits, obviously at a lower rate, basically a one basis points relative to our wholesale, that costs about 100 basis points. So part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding, CDs and other wholesale funding with the off balance sheet deposits that we're going to bring back on balance sheet. So we started the quarter, I think about 65% of our funding and the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%, we would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off. That's obviously based on the maturities. So we continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with the incremental deposits from E*TRADE. Sure. I'll give that a crack and we're not naive. We don't expect to have a 100% of the wallet of all of our clients. So clearly, we don't expect them to bring in all 8 trillion over time, but there is significant overlap as you note in these channels and in these wealth figures. We continue as you saw through the net new assets as James mentioned, a lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisors advise their clients. And we've seen people bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels on the workplace. I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets. And then over time growing the relationships, self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E*TRADE platform as their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice. We're clearly going to capture that top part of the funnel with the FA led model that we have. So again, a real opportunity and I liked the way you described it, just look at the numbers 2.5 million households, almost 5 million participants in 6.7 million households, the breadth and reach of the platform is quite large and there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from. In terms of good activity, as you can imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need with the E*TRADE acquisition we bring on, incremental digital capabilities, and as you can imagine this year, we're spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients. We're going to pilot around lead generation, we've defined the advisor group who is going to work with new clients, got scoring systems, we've got artificial intelligence, trying to help predict what people are going to want and need, and next best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made, plus the digital from wealth and we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward. Yes, I would say we're still learning; crisis is not over. We clearly are hopeful around the rollout of the vaccine. I think there are going to be some takeaways around some of the digital client experiences that we've been able to do the work from home that we've been able to do, but I think it's little early to start making those decisions. Let's get through the crisis first. I think all those numbers that you gave are correct. The funding synergies are really from this transition from the off balance sheet, the on balance sheet and the run-off of the wholesale deposits. So again, that use more towards the back half in that, 80% that's when you get into the second quarter, you'll be using a quarter number, not a full-year benefit number, and then 25% on costs and approximately 40% on the integration costs. Also, yes, those are the right numbers. Sure. On the assessment management fees line, obviously the exit rate, as you know we get the benefit now for the full year of the $1.5 trillion in fee-based assets have average effect and exit effect in terms of 2021. So now, at $1.5 trillion asset, we also have the benefit of the net new assets that we bring in over 2021. Though on an average basis, we would expect continued growth obviously in that line. We had over 10% year-over-year in that asset management fees. And then on transactional, it's really going to around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter, we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that that was helped by the DCP number which presumably may or may not repeat next year. But that the margin on that revenue, as we have talked about in the past, is virtually zero. And so, transactional generally has been declining. We now have the E*TRADE platform inside Morgan Stanley, so the commissions based on their options trading as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number. So, it will be at a new level. But generally that's going to be driven by volume-related activity. And we'll have to see how it plays out recognizing the first 11 days of have been pretty good. Sure. Well, I'll just give you a few. So -- again, we issued $11 billion of equity or about $230 million shares, generated $7.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles. You'll see that in the first couple of pages of the supplement. Of that goodwill and intangibles, about $3 billion is going to be amortized at a rough rate of about 15 years, so about $200 million. And that would be allocated in the non-comps in the wealth segment. Yes. I mean I think we tried to lay that out. As I said on page seven, you can see what pre closing -- so, the September 30 number shows the self-directed assets within Morgan Stanley before the deal closed. So, yes, the growth has really been in the E*TRADE channel. Your number of about 900,000 is accurate. Again I think from our disclosure going forward, we had to conform sort of definitions and whatnot, but they have had real strong growth with new clients given the activity level this year. It's a number you'll be able to track whether the self-directed channel is growing through that number going forward. I don't think we're going to be explicitly disclosing net new clients within the self-directed channel as we try to integrate and bring these two businesses together. Yes."

At this time, all participants lines are on mute. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Eric Senay, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Senay: Thank you. And good morning. And welcome to our fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance, as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website, eatonvance.com, under the heading Investor Relations. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including, but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 annual report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Faust Jr.: Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Since we reported our second quarter earnings results in late May, our business, our employees and the communities in which we live and work have continued to be significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of our staff continues to work remotely. And that remains our expectations through at least the balance of this year.  Our employees have adapted quite effectively to working from home with minimal disruption to day to day operations and high levels of client service being maintained throughout the pandemic period.  The strength and resilience of our business in this difficult environment is testament to the adaptability and commitment of our employees across the company, for which I remain deeply grateful.  Since the sharp market sell off in March, the stimulus actions of governments around the globe and visible progress advancing the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics have fueled a recovery in financial markets. Over the course of our third fiscal quarter ending in July, we regained $39.4 billion of the $43.6 billion of managed assets that we lost to market price declines in the previous quarter. While the pandemic is far from over, markets are increasingly willing to bet that the worst is behind us and the economic recovery will continue.  Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, reflecting a $0.90 per diluted share reduction in the carrying value of our position in 49% owned Hexavest, together with $.07 per diluted share of income and gains on seed capital investments in consolidated CLO entities and other items that we exclude from our adjusted earnings calculation.  The reduction in the carrying value of our position in Hexavest reflects outflows-driven declines in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue, which accelerated the spring and summer following disappointing investment performance in the pandemic-related March market sell-off.  Throughout its history dating back to 2004, Hexavest has employed a value-leaning preservation of capital oriented investment style that typically generates its strongest relative returns during periods of market weakness.  Unfortunately for Hexavest, this year's market decline did not follow the usual pattern as value stocks significantly lagged growth stocks, both during the sell-off and in the market recovery to date. Reflecting net outflows of $2.7 billion during our third fiscal quarter, Hexavest closed the quarter with managed assets of $6.8 billion. That compares to managed assets of $11 billion at the time we acquired our position in Hexavest in 2012. Peak managed assets of $17.1 billion in 2014 and $13.4 billion of managed assets at the end of our fiscal 2019 last October. While we're disappointed that recent reductions in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue have necessitated writing down the carrying value of our investment, we continue to believe in Hexavest investment approach and fully support the company's management. Hexavest business remains solid and secure, and their talented investment team continues to engage actively in the markets, seeking to deliver value for their clients.  Turning to our core operating results. We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with $507 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 9% from the end of the previous quarter.  Across our investment mandate reporting categories, increases in managed assets range from a high of 12% for fixed income and 10% for Parametric custom portfolios to a low of 3% for alternative assets and floating rate income. In the third quarter, we had $2.7 billion of consolidated net inflows or $1.2 billion excluding Parametric overlay services.  The quarter's net flows were driven primarily by fixed income mandates, open-end funds and individual separate accounts.  Annualized internal growth for the quarter was 2%, as measured both in terms of consolidated managed assets and consolidated management fee revenue. That represents a sharp recovery from the prior quarters annualized internal growth in managed assets of minus 7% and annualized internal growth in management fee revenue of minus 6%.  Flow results generally improved as the quarter progressed, with July showing 13% annualized internal growth in managed assets or 4% excluding Parametric overlay services.  Looking at our third quarter flow results by investment mandate reporting category, fixed income net inflows for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which equates to annualized internal growth of 29%.  Within fixed income, the largest contributor to fund net inflows were our category-leading Eaton Vance short duration government income fund, with net inflows of $1.7 billion, high yield bond and municipal income mutual funds, each with approximately $650 million of net inflows and emerging market local debt bonds with $300 million of net inflows.  Fixed income institutional separate accounts saw over $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, led by cash management, high yield bond and emerging market local debt mandates.  For the fiscal year-to-date, managed assets in our emerging market local debt strategies have increased 54% to over $2.2 billion, reflecting strong performance of our two five star rated mutual funds in this category, Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund and Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Debt Opportunities Funds, as well as initial success attracting intermediary and institutional clients in offshore markets.  Turning to equities, Calvert Equity strategies contributed nearly $800 million of net inflows in the third quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date, flows into Calvert Equity strategies have totaled more than $2.7 billion, generating 27% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the nine months.  Calvert Equity Fund and Calvert Small Cap Funds each contributed nearly $200 million of inflows in the third quarter, with Calvert Emerging Markets Fund and Calvert International Equity Fund together contributing nearly $175 million of additional net inflows in the quarter.  EBM equity strategies generated approximately $200 million of net inflows in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by privately offered funds and our Eaton Vance Investment Counsel wealth management business.  Atlanta Capital had equity net outflows of nearly $100 million in the third quarter as net inflows into their large cap growth and select equity strategies were offset by $420 million of net outflows from the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, their largest mutual fund, which has been closed to new investors since April 2018.  With net outflows since the fund's closure now totaling approximately $1.6 billion, the fund's board of trustees voted earlier this week to reopen the fund to new investors effective September 30.  The portfolio team at Atlanta Capital views it as a particularly opportune time to invest in the types of high quality stocks in which the fund specializes as these stocks have moved to attractive relative valuations.  Parametric had $3.1 billion of net outflows from equity mandate in the third fiscal quarters. This reflects the termination of a single $1.7 billion institutional covered call writing mandate and $1.6 billion of performance-related net outflows from Parametric systematic emerging market equity strategies during the quarter.  Parametric systematic EME strategies apply a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation that results in a structural underweighting to the China market, which has been a performance leader among the emerging markets over recent periods. The quarter-end managed assets in parametric systematic EME strategies consisted of $1.5 billion of US mutual fund AUM and $2.6 billion of offshore private fund and institutional separate account mandates.  Turning to floating rate income. Net outflows for the third fiscal quarter were just under $600 million, a significant improvement from nearly $3.2 billion of net outflows in the preceding quarter.  After a steep down draft in March, bank loan prices have now recovered most of the way back to pre-pandemic levels. With the recovery in loan prices, activity in the CLO market has also resumed. In July, we successfully placed a new CLO entity that closed earlier this week, which will contribute $450 million to our fourth quarter net flows. In our alternative asset mandate reporting category, net outflows improved sequentially from nearly $700 million in the second fiscal quarter to less than $50 million in the third fiscal quarter. The improved flow results are attributable primarily to reduced net outflows from our two global macro absolute return strategies, for which combined net outflows were under $50 million in the third fiscal quarter versus over $650 million in the prior quarter.  Net flows into our global macro absolute return strategies and alternative asset mandates as a whole turned positive for the month of July.  Parametric overlay services had $1.5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $6.5 billion of net outflows in the prior fiscal quarter. Clients gains and loss contributed $750 million of net inflows in the third quarter versus $600 million in the prior quarter.  Changes in positions held by continuing overlay clients contributed $750 million of net inflows for the third quarter, greatly improved from $7 billion of net outflows from continuing clients in the second fiscal quarter.  Consistent with prior market downturns, we've seen continuing clients increasingly put back on their overlay positions as markets have recovered. After three straight months of net reductions in positions held by continuing overlay clients, net flows from continuing clients swung to the positive in June and improved further in July. With a $4 billion pipeline of new overlay clients expected to onboard in the fourth quarter and the prospect of continuing net inflows from existing clients, our overlay services business is poised for a very strong close to the fiscal year. Parametric custom portfolios had $470 million of net outflows in the third fiscal quarter, which reflects continuing positive flow results for Custom Core equity and ladder fixed income individual separate accounts, offset by outflows from institutional and subadvisory mandates.  What we sometimes refer to as custom beta individual separate accounts, which includes Parametric Custom Core equity plus municipal and corporate bond ladders, had $1.9 billion of net inflows for the quarter, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. The decline from $2.8 billion of net inflows and 9% internal growth annualized in the prior quarter primarily reflects the withdrawal by a single ultra-high net worth Custom Core client of $700 million to fund a major charitable contribution. Within parametric custom portfolios, institutional and subadvisory mandates had aggregate net outflows of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which compares to $650 million of net outflows in the preceding quarter. These net outflows reflect negative flow results for the underlying third-party managed investment strategies, unrelated to Parametric's role there as implementation manager.  We continue to view customized individual separate accounts as a leading long-term trend in asset management and an open ended market opportunity in which Parametric is positioned for continued dominance.  We recently announced the extension of the Parametric Custom Core franchise to include, for the first time, index-based fixed income strategies. Parametric Custom Core fixed income seeks to provide advisors and their clients with exposure to the fixed income markets they select, combining the benefits of index-based portfolio construction, active credit oversight, and direct ownership of securities.  Like Custom Core equity portfolios, Custom Core fixed income can be customized to reflect each client's individual responsible investment criteria and other desired portfolio tilts and exclusions to incorporate the client's preexisting securities holdings and to harvest tax losses on a year round systematic basis. Similar to our laddered bond separate account, Custom Core fixed income portfolios combined the rules-based approach to portfolio construction, with active credit oversight and available tax management. Different from laddered bond portfolios, Custom Core fixed income accounts seek to provide market exposures that approximate a client-specified fixed income index or combination of indexes.  Beyond Custom Core equities and fixed income, we see broadly-ranging future opportunities for Parametric custom separate accounts across multi-asset portfolios, applications combining active and passive management, and customized individual target date and target risk portfolios. The future remains very bright for Parametric custom portfolios.  In June, we announced the launch of Calvert ESG Research Leader Strategies, a new series of equity separate account offerings for institutional and individual investors. These strategies invest in the stock of companies with leading environmental, social and governance characteristics as determined by Calvert. Through partnership with Parametric, tax managed separate account versions of selected ESG research leaders strategies are available to serve taxpaying investors.  We also announced in June the creation of the Calvert Institute for Responsible Investing, an affiliated research institute dedicated to driving positive change by advancing understanding and promoting best practices and responsible investing.  Since we acquired the business assets of Calvert's predecessor company at the end of 2016, Calvert's managed assets have more than doubled, reaching $24.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. With $3.4 billion of net inflows into Calvert fund and separate accounts over the past nine months, Calvert has realized 23% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the fiscal year-to-date.  Among dedicated responsibly invested mutual funds, Calvert is far and away the market leader in terms of net inflows over the past 3 and 12 months, and ranks second currently in total assets under management. The strength of Calvert's brand as a long-term leader in responsible investing, combined with strong investment performance, and Eaton Vance's leading distribution presence in the US intermediary channel has proven to be a winning formula for Calvert. We see much more growth for Calvert in the quarters and years ahead.  During the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaterOak Advisors, a wealth management firm headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with approximately $2 billion of client assets under management. With a shared focus on high touch client service and a commitment to long-term relationships, the combination of WaterOak and Eaton Vance Investment Counsel will strengthen our position in private wealth management, which is an important strategic priority, and allow us to develop a much larger business serving high net worth individuals and families in Florida and throughout the southeast.  Looking ahead to our fourth fiscal quarter, we are optimistic that the business momentum we saw building over the course of the third quarter will continue to accelerate. We entered the fourth quarter with managed assets and run rate management fees well above third quarter average levels.  Net flows across our business have been quite strong over the month of August, with overall net flows, both with and without Parametric overlay services, back in the range of what we saw in our first fiscal quarter before the pandemic hit.  We have a robust pipeline of new business to fund in the fourth quarter, including the $450 million CLO that closed earlier this week and $800 million institutional high-yield mandates scheduled to fund in early October, approximately $700 million of Custom Core equity separate accounts in the pipeline, and over $5 billion of institutional portfolio overlay and LDI mandates scheduled to fund before the end of October.  Reopening the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, our largest mutual fund, to new investors after a two-and-a-half year hiatus should also contribute positively to the favorable flow trends we expect to continue.  We believe there is considerable reason for optimism about the growth and performance of our business over the balance of fiscal 2020 and beyond.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. \nLaurie Hylton: Thank you. And good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  As you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.83 per diluted share in the third quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of the $100.5 million impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in our 49% owned affiliate, Hexavest, the reversal of $8.5 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.6 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $0.2 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of $4.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.3 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and the reversal of $0.6 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  As Tom discussed in more detail, the outflows driven decline in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue over recent months prompted the determination that, in the third fiscal quarter, the company's equity method investment in Hexavest [indiscernible] temporarily impaired. Accordingly, the company recognized an impairment charge of $100.5 million in the quarter to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Hexavest to $32.7 million, which is estimated fair value based on the independent appraisal. As Tom previously noted, we continue to have faith in Hexavest leadership and confidence in our investment team and approach. As shown in Attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted operating income was up 7% sequentially, down 5% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.6% in the third quarter fiscal 2020 compared to 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020 and 32.4%. in the third quarter fiscal 2019.  Versus the prior quarter, average managed assets were up 1%. The management fee revenue increased 4%. The increase in management fee revenue exceeded the increase in average managed assets primarily due to a 2% increase in our average annualized management fee rate from 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter fiscal 2020 and the impact of two more fee days in the third quarter.  Although average managed assets this quarter were up 3% from the same period last year, net management fee revenue was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 31.8 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period last year was driven primarily by shifts in our business, from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.9 million, $2.5 million and $0.1 million to revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2020 and the third quarter fiscal 2019 respectively.  Management fees earned on consolidated investment entities, which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate, were $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 respectively.  Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased 5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting higher operating income based, investment performance based bonus accruals; higher stock-based compensation primarily driven by additional expense recognized during the third quarter in connection with employee retirements; higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, primarily parametric; the impact of two additional payroll days in the third quarter and higher benefit expenses, driven by a $1.7 million insurance reimbursement recorded last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower sales based incentive compensation and a decrease in payroll taxes.  Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compensation costs decreased 1%, reflecting lower operating income based bonus accruals, lower sales-based incentive compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by a higher stock-based compensation and higher salaries and benefit expenses associated with increases in headcount, again, primarily at Parametric. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, were substantially unchanged from second quarter fiscal 2020 as higher private funds service fee expenses and marketing support payments were offset by lower upfront sales commission expense.  Year-over-year non-compensation distribution-related costs decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses for Class A and Class C mutual fund shares, driven by lower average managed assets, lower upfront sales commissions, lower discretionary marketing expenses, and lower intermediary marketing support payments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in service fee expenses and commission amortization from private funds.  Fund-related expenses decreased 12% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, reflecting lower fund expenses borne by the company, partially offset by higher subadvisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subadvised funds.  Other operating expenses decreased 2% from the second quarter fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting lower travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in other corporate expenses due to a one-time charge of $1.4 million related to a reimbursement to the company sponsored funds recorded in the third quarter.  Other operating expenses increased 5% from the third quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending and the above-mentioned one-time charge, partially offset by lower travel expenses.  Although we are continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company, we are otherwise focused on tight expense management and reducing discretionary spending.  In this period of volatility, we continue to benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results.  Non-operating income expense was up $105.7 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting an $84.2 million positive change in net gains or losses and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $21 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities; and a $0.5 million decrease in interest expense.  Non-operating income was up $26.8 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting an $18.8 million increase in net gains and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies and an $8 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities.  Turning to taxes. The US GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 45.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 25.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in attachment 2 to our press, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the impact of gains, losses and other investment income of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, exclude the effect of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards and remove the impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in Hexavest.  On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 26.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.4% and 26.9%.  In addition to the Hexavest impairment loss previously noted, equity net income of affiliates in the third quarter fiscal 2020 includes $1 million of income earned from the company's investment in Hexavest, which was partially offset by $0.8 million of losses related to the company's investment in a private equity partnership. Substantially all of equity net income of affiliates in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 related to the company's investment in Hexavest.  We finished our third fiscal quarter holding $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $280.5 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flows during this period of heightened economic and market uncertainty to maintain our financial flexibility.  During the third quarter fiscal 2020, we used $41.2 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share of quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.7 million in the third quarter fiscal 2020, flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards due to lower market prices of the company shares.  Fiscal discipline, tight management of discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet continue to be top financial priorities for us in these unprecedented times.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: It looks like you had no share repurchase, I think maybe for the first time ever, at least in my model. Could you speak to maybe the thinking around that after the share price decline? Was there some sort of unique restriction this quarter? And how should we think about that going forward? \nLaurie Hylton: Hi. It's Laurie. As we were looking at this quarter and last quarter, it really has been top of mind for us to ensure that we've got financial flexibility, particularly in terms of our liquidity. And I think as we mentioned last quarter, given everything that's happening on the global stage, we felt it was prudent to cut back on our share repurchases and we just continue to look at it quarter by quarter. But again, we're really just trying to ensure that we've got the liquidity necessary to continue to grow the business. \nPatrick Davitt: And then also, just a quick follow-up. The parametric emerging markets strategy, you called out with some performance-related outflows. I think you said there was $1.5 billion and $2.6 billion left in that bucket. Should we take that to mean that you're worried that that might be AUM at risk given the performance issues? \nThomas Faust Jr.: I think there's a reasonable chance that unless performance improves that it's an active strategy that competes against other attractive strategies in each of our businesses. If you if you can't deliver performance that exceeds benchmarks and peer groups over time, it's reasonable to expect assets to come down.  We have seen quite a bit of net outflows from that strategy. We think there's likely to be more stickiness to the assets on the mutual fund side perhaps than the non-mutual fund business. But certainly, for modeling purposes, we would assume that outflows there will continue. Ultimately, we're constrained by the amount of outflows by the assets that we have, which is down to just over $4 billion currently. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. \nCraig Siegenthaler: I'm interested in an update on what you're seeing on the competitive landscape at Parametric and Custom Core equity. And I'm especially interested in your comments around direct indexing. \nThomas Faust Jr.: So, there's quite a bit of, I guess, you would say noise. There have been announcements of a number of potential competitors that have interest in the space, public comments. In many ways, have been gratifying that people acknowledge that this is an area that provides value added for clients and many people perceive to have growth potential. In terms of what's happening in the marketplace as opposed to what we're hearing in announcements, there really hasn't been a meaningful change in competitive position. There's no new competitor that we're aware of that's taking significant share. We're not losing business being replaced by someone else. So, there's no evidence that any of the announcements are translating so far into changes in the competitive dynamic.  This is a business that we and many others expect will grow quite substantially over coming quarters and years. It's not a surprise that others will try and compete in this business, given the growth profile that is there.  I would say that our experience which goes back now several decades is that this is a hard business. It's not a business for dabblers, that there's a real commitment required to invest in technology, to invest in service and to invest in distribution to gain access across the markets.  So far, there haven't been any competitors that have emerged that we're worried about who check all those boxes in terms of the level of commitment and demonstrated expertise and technology and service and have similar distribution to us. But we think it will be a much bigger market. It's reasonable that there'll be more competitors. But we think that the position that Parametric has there is very solid, very strong and very secure. \nCraig Siegenthaler: And just a follow-up here. If you do see an increase in competition in direct indexing and new entrants offer comparable product at lower price points, can you comment on your ability to reduce pricing below the mid-teens, which is where I think the blended fee rate is today and still generate attractive margins?\nThomas Faust Jr.: Certainly. We have the ability to respond selectively to competitors that compete on price. We will go toe to toe with anyone in terms of the quality and the value proposition that we offer as a leader in customized indexing. Competition in this space is not new. Throughout the time that we've been growing our custom indexing business, there have been other players in the market. The profile of those competitors really hasn't changed. The nature of the competition really hasn't changed. What has happened is that as the market has grown, its visibility has increased and we're seeing more conversation. But in terms of what's happening in the marketplace, we continue to compete as appropriately on price. We see nothing to suggest that we'll see wholesale reductions in average fee rates for this business. But we're certainly making the investments in technology and service and systems that will allow us to support a much bigger business and that ultimately will allow us to lower our operating costs, so that we can achieve attractive margins even at potentially lower average fee rates. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: Just to follow-up on kind of the flows and the momentum you cited heading into the fourth quarter. If you could just clarify again, I think you said the total number will be similar to the first quarter, I think either including or excluding some of the lower fee stuff, but just want to clarify that.  And then also, does that include some of the mandates you talked about or just trying to think about what still has been funded versus what you're saying has happened in August? \nThomas Faust Jr.: Let me clarify, Dan. So, the comment what I was trying to make is that [indiscernible] for our August to date, this would not include any of the pipeline things that I talked about. We're seeing quite strong flows that if you exclude the Parametric overlay service business, puts us, we think, on pace for the same range of flows that we saw in the first quarter. Again, that's based on quarter-to-date results through yesterday and \u2013 through the day before yesterday, I guess. That is in the range of about, I think, $1.7 billion for our non-Parametric overlay business. You multiply that by three to account for the fact that we're less than a third of the way through the quarter. And that gets you sort of in the ballpark of the $5 billion of non-overlay net flows that we had in the first quarter.  Momentum is good. That includes strong sales with fixed income continuing, positive flows for equity, positive flows for floating rate income, positive custom portfolios.  As I mentioned, we're expecting on top of that a quite strong quarter for the overlay services business where we've got meaningful amount \u2013 a couple billion dollars plus of net inflows for the quarter-to-date, plus a quite robust pipeline of new business that we're expecting to fund.  All these forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt. We're only a third of the way through the quarter. Things can happen as we saw back in March. But, certainly, we're on track for a quite strong fourth quarter in terms of flows, supported by an excellent first month of that quarter and a visible pipeline of new opportunities that we think will likely support continuing flow momentum through the balance of this month and then through September and into the end of October and the end of the fiscal year. \nDaniel Fannon: And then, Laurie, just with regards to expenses and kind of the outlook, clearly, with the revenue side looking better based on where markets and AUM sit, as we think about going into next quarter, is margin expansion from here still reasonable, given what's happening with revenue and then still some kind of operational leverage potential on some of the non-discretionary spending side? \nLaurie Hylton: I would certainly say there's always the possibility. I hesitate just given the volatility that we see in the markets to put money on anything at this point. But I do think that we're very comfortable in thinking that the year is going to be in this 31% range. I would not necessarily anticipate a significant uptick in the fourth quarter, but I do think we're very comfortable in the range that we're in. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: I'll combine everything into one. Just following up on the equity outflows this quarter, it seemed to some extent that the weakness this quarter was as much a function of weaker gross sales versus the last couple of quarters as it was for the higher gross outflows. So, can you flesh out, if you agree, the gross sales side of the equation as well? And for the follow-up on the outflows, you mentioned, I believe, it was $1.7 billion of covered calls and the $1.6 billion of the systematic. For the covered call strategy, how do those strategies typically do in this type of market? And maybe how much is left there? And on the systematic side, you said it was performance based. I believe you called out China as the driver. Are there other issues besides exposure to China or was that really all of the issue? \nThomas Faust Jr.: Starting with emerging market equities, systematic strategy, so they don't make market falls. So, think about this in the broad category of things as smart beta or multi-factor strategy. The premise of the fund is value added through diversification and rebalancing. The philosophy is a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation and alpha generation by rebalancing into underperforming countries.  That worked for a very long time. It has not worked recently simply because the China market has come to dominate the emerging market indexes both in terms of weighting, but also in terms of contribution to performance. So, a strategy that by design is underweight to the largest markets \u2013 in this case, China \u2013 is very much hamstrung in trying to perform in market environments which we've been in where you have sustained leadership of those largest countries in the index. So, we've had performance-related outflows. I guess you would say, in addition to the country allocation, given the rebalancing nature of the approach we take, there's an anti-momentum bias to the strategy that also has not helped during this period. But the outflows are, we think, going to abate. I highlighted that we're at $4 billion in assets. I think peak assets in this strategy were in the range of $20 billion. So, it's mostly behind us in terms of the outflows, with only a remaining $4 billion left.  How quickly we see that go away I think is anyone's guess. But we're certainly expecting based on performance that we've seen, as of current periods, still underperforming. So, we think it's reasonable to expect that outflows will continue.  A second part of the question related to the covered call writing business and what Parametric refers to as volatility, risk premium strategies that is monetizing the alpha that's created from the fact that options typically sell at a premium, where the implied volatility is typically higher than the realized volatility.  Those strategies generally perform well during trending markets when you collect your premium, but you don't get called away from the upside or have to buy in a position to avoid getting called away on the upside.  When they don't perform particularly well, as in the tight markets where there's a sharp upturn, which obviously is what we've had in the April/May period after the lows in March, so it's not surprising that we would see pressure on these strategies in market environments like this. Covered call writing is essentially trying to capture this premium that's frequently observed in the pricing of options. But it comes potentially at the cost of capping the upside in a sharply rising market. And when that happens, clients are prone to be disappointed.  After some period of clients taking off positions, I think generally we're in a mode of sort of neutrality to positive flows for our covered call writing business. So, I think that covers the second part. The third, which I don't really have information in front of me, it's like I'm going to have to guess at this. But did the quarterly flow results for equities reflect more a decline in gross sales or more an increase in redemptions? I would say \u2013 I guess I would maybe turn the question around, I guess, and say most of our business, the Calvert business had positive flows, the EBM equity business had positive flows, the Atlanta Capital business excluding the big fund there that's close to new investors had positive flows.  I would turn it around to say that the outflows that we saw in the equity category were very concentrated in the two things that I called out at Parametric. That being the covered call writing, the big institutional account that was lost there, the $1.7 billion, the emerging market equity strategies, and then the outflows from the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which was over $400 million.  So, in general, we feel our equity flows are good. A flash report through yesterday shows positive equity flows in the fourth quarter. And we certainly feel good about our ability to continue to grow in equities, subject to continuing pressure on that emerging market equity franchise that weighs against them. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. \nWilliam Katz: Maybe just a two-parter. Maybe for Laurie. Just curious, in terms of capital management, what milestones should we be looking at macro-wise or otherwise, to think about the reengagement of repurchase given your free cash flow? And then, Tom, just a big picture perspective. As you're dialoguing with both the retail and institutional gatekeepers, what are you hearing in terms of allocation decisions, just given the V-shaped recovery of equity and credit markets? Thank you. \nLaurie Hylton: We really don't have any markers that I would say to look towards. We don't have a program for share repurchases. It's a discretionary decision. We have a small committee that thinks about this every quarter, and I think that we'll be considering all the possible inputs as we move out of our blackouts. So, more to come on that, but nothing specific to look for in terms of markers. \nThomas Faust Jr.: Bill, in terms of markets and where we're headed, first, I'm generally not too involved in those decisions with gatekeepers about asset allocation. My own market view is that the markets will likely continue to grind their way higher, given what we see as likely to be continuing positive news on the on the pandemic, particularly from a therapeutic and vaccine standpoint, more so than public health, and the likelihood that the economy will continue to be paused. It's certainly one of the things we're watching carefully, is US election and what that might imply for future tax rates, future regulatory and spending initiatives.  I think as most of our listeners are aware, we have a large business serving tax paying investors, which represent \u2013 some version of tax managed strategies represent over 40% of our assets, including municipal bond funds and tax managed equities. We're not exactly sure what's going to happen, but we certainly think that there's a reasonable prospect that, following the election, we could see an increase in tax rates, which could be a significant positive for that business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: A lot of good questions and answers on the Parametric. Maybe if I could just add one comment. I guess what do you make of the importance of fractional share accounting in the costume indexing business in terms of the potential competitor responses down the road? And again, going back to \u2013 obviously, your business has performed very well and you have a leading position in this business, but going forward, if it's not competing on pricing, what other growth angles within the Parametric business, I guess, would you point to [indiscernible]?\nThomas Faust Jr.: We compete primarily in high net worth markets for Parametric custom portfolios. For Custom Core equities, the account minimum at most places, I believe, is $250,000. So, the impact of fractional shares for someone that's putting to work $250,000 is pretty minimal.  There is the opportunity with fractional shares, and you've been reading about these, to do less customized or even non-customized direct indexing based strategies, which to us is not a particularly interesting product or interesting market, our perspective is that the value here is in the customization. And the cost of delivering customization is the service that's required. And to deliver customized accounts and high levels of service at the kinds of fee rates we're talking about and account minimums we're talking about is hard. And we're making investments in technology to put us in a position to continue to be a leader in doing that.  But I would say, broadly, the impact of fractional shares, while it will make it easier for us and other competitors potentially to go down market, the real name of the game here is customization. The primary value added for most investors, not all, but most, is tax efficiency, which is a concern primarily at higher tax rates.  We do see the business evolving in significant ways. I highlighted the fact that we've introduced Custom Core indexed products on the fixed income side. We certainly see lots of opportunity for product innovation down the road in terms of enhancing the features that we offer, expanding the array of capabilities, so that it's not just index based, but it's index plus active. It's not just equity or not just fixed income, but a combination of both. And then, very interesting applications potentially down the road in terms of target date or target risk, all customized to the individual.  So, we think there's lots of room here for lots of different ideas. The value added that we provide, again, is customization and service, primarily for higher net worth investors, primarily with the significant value add being tax. And some of the things that we're hearing about really just not relevant to that market and that market opportunity as we see it.\nBrian Bedell: And then, maybe a follow-up. Just on your perspective on the active ETF industry, now that we've got a number of ETFs live in the industry, I know you filed an amendment for the clear hedge strategy with the SEC, maybe just to comment on, I guess, the status on that and how you think that maybe conversations with potential users of the clear hedge strategy. And then, broadly, the potential for you guys to license active ETFs or create them under a proxy portfolio structure for your own funds. \nThomas Faust Jr.: We remain very interested, very close to the space, as you point out. We did file a second amended application with the SEC for our clear hedge method of what we call portfolio protected ETFs. I'm going to call it less transparent of active ETFs. We filed that last month. You can read that as indicative of positive constructive dialogue with the SEC staff. We certainly can't predict when or ultimately what they will decide, but we certainly feel good about the dialogue that we're engaged in there and are hopeful we'll get a \u2013 ultimately get a positive result.  The competitive landscape is really just beginning to emerge. I think there's five different concepts that have been approved by the SEC. We hope to be the sixth. Our business model here would include licensing our technology to others. We hope to compete on the basis of offering the highest level of assurance of strong secondary market trading, consistent with not having to disclose portfolio holdings or significant representative proxy portfolio on a daily basis.  So, we think we've got a very competitive mousetrap. This market is starting to develop based on the assets and flow numbers that I've seen. And we certainly want to have a place in that.  Like the other approved applications, our application, at least initially, is limited to cash and exchange-traded securities that trade during US market hours. So, think of that as US equities and US ETFs and Canadian and perhaps other markets that trade during the same timeframe as the US. So, it would be limited in that respect initially, which we think \u2013 frankly, quite reasonably, the SEC says, let's see what how this works for this asset class before we consider other asset classes. But we're very hopeful, very optimistic that, ultimately, this class of products and our application and our technology in particular will see application across all asset classes. And so, we continue to be very much optimistic about the future of actively managed exchange-traded products based on the potential enhancement in operating efficiency, trading convenience and tax efficiency versus ETFs.  And so, while we have a long heritage in the mutual fund industry, we are very committed to the development of customized individual separate accounts as an enhanced way for investors to invest in an array of strategies. And then, similarly invested in less transparent ETFs or portfolio protected ETFs as a way to do similar things through a fund vehicle with structural advantages versus a traditional mutual fund concept. \nBrian Bedell: And just for licensing your own funds, would you more likely use a proxy model that's out there already or, let's say, the [indiscernible] model and then apply the clear hedge to the proxy?\nThomas Faust Jr.: No, we would be using our model as an alternative to the \u2013 think of clear hedge as a sixth approach, not something that would be an add-on to one of the other approaches.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. \nMichael Carrier: Tom, overall, the flow outlook looks promising. I just wanted to get an update on how you're seeing demand shift in the floating rate category and then if there was anything unusual and strange in the fixed income this quarter.  And then, just a small clarification as a follow-up, I think you mentioned one or two funds reopening. I caught one was Atlantic Capital, but I wasn't sure if there was another one that you mentioned as well. \nThomas Faust Jr.: The only fund we have that's reopening is the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which is an important milestone for us. It is our largest and, I guess, by that measure, most popular fund and it's got a real strong following. And because it's been closed, we've seen fairly significant net outflows. I think I said $420 million in the quarter. So, once that's reopened, I would hope, at a minimum, we can stop the net outflows and potentially get that fund back into a growth mode again. It's not an open ended opportunity. We're potentially looking at closing it again, if we get significant net inflows. But at a minimum, we're hoping to abate the outflows there.  In terms of bank loans, it's an interesting position we're in currently. We are, I just said, modestly to the positive in terms of our bank loan flows for the month of August today through Monday of this week. But it's pretty small, positive, but closer to zero than some meaningful number. That does not include the CLO that I talked about as a big price this week. So, we're thinking that we've kind of bottomed out. We had a very rough quarter in the second quarter in terms of bank loan flows.  Yields here are pretty attractive. And I just checked this morning. The yield on our unlevered floating rate fund is about 3.6%. The modestly levered version is at 4.4%. And the version that has allocation to high yield is at 3.8%. Those are pretty attractive yields for a floating rate product in today's marketplace. Obviously, you've got to be comfortable taking credit risk because that's a component of this asset class. These are below investment grade securities.  But if people are generally getting comfortable that we've seen the worst in the economy and you look at what kinds of yields are available in other instruments and you start to worry \u2013 at least some people do worry \u2013 about the possibility that loan rates could be moving up and we may have hit the bottom in terms of where those are, you start to build an environment in which falling rate bank loans could be, again, an attractive asset class.  Our history in this business, which goes back to 1989, is that it's a business of cyclical growth, in which our pattern has been over market cycles. We typically hit a new high in assets and then people's rate expectations change and we see outflows or people get concerned about credit and we see outflows.  But we see nothing about our industry position or about the fundamental attractiveness of the asset class to suggest that we can't again regain the former highs in managed assets, which were in the, I think, mid-40s billions of dollars. So, that's not going to happen overnight, but we certainly think that we're in the bottoming stage or we're maybe coming out of the bottoming stage and are hopeful that we'll see an improvement in flows. But it's not happening yet. The good flows that we've had for August have been much more driven by fixed income as opposed to floating rate income with continued very healthy flows for our short duration government income fund, for our high yield strategies and for our muni strategies being the primary drivers of our income products flows.  The nice thing about bank loans is it's not a negative currently in the same way that it was a significant negative in the second quarter and a modest negative in the third quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Robert Lee with KBW.\nJeffrey Drezner: Hi. This is actually Jeff Drezner on for Rob Lee. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a question. I was curious about the \u2013 if you can give us an update on the potential acquisitions, you see things accelerating, where your focus might be on that? \nThomas Faust Jr.: We highlighted in my prepared remarks that we announced an acquisition of a $2 billion wealth manager in Florida called WaterOak Advisors. We announced it, I think, last month, and would hope to close that before the end of the year.  You should take that as a signal that we continue to be interested in expanding in wealth management. We're approaching $10 billion in managed assets there, including WaterOak after that transaction is closed, which is a meaningful sized competitor in the wealth management space and think that we have a lot to offer there and we'll look for other ways to grow there.  Other things that we find potentially interesting and where we continue to have conversations include private credit, which we view as a potentially highly complementary to our strong industry position and capabilities in the public credit markets through bank loans and high yield bonds. So, those are maybe two areas of focus.  We continue to look for opportunities to grow our platform in responsible investing, particularly if we can do that outside the United States. Calvert is today primarily a US brand that, in an ideal world, we could grow our presence in responsible investing outside the United States. So, those are some of the things we're looking at. \nJeffrey Drezner: And then, just another one on the muni ladder. In terms of the low rate environment, how do you see the demand for those and the outlook?\nThomas Faust Jr.: That is frankly a challenge that, for investment grade muni ladders, there's just not a whole lot of yield available at current interest rates. One of the things we've been looking to do and are in the process of potentially bringing to market is a separate account product that includes a sleeve allocated to high yield muni issuance or corporate issuance for corporate ladders. That brings up the yield and does it in a diversified \u2013 an appropriately diversified way. So, it would be owning as a part of a ladder or a separate account structure, a sleeve dedicated to a diversified portfolio of higher yielding assets with the goal to bring up the overall income level for the portfolio in a managed controlled risk way. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. \nGlenn Schorr: Tom, I wanted to ask a little follow-up on your comments earlier, given tax managed importance to your overall AUM base. And I'm with you between the election and the huge stimulus that it's a good chance tax rates are going up at some point. So, the question is, what can you do to prepare either educating the clients, educating the wealth management channel? And is the post-election tax cut any indication in reverse of what we might see \u2013 how big of an opportunity do you see a higher tax rate environment across your platform? \nThomas Faust Jr.: We've gone through this a few times. We've had a focus on tax managed equities and muni bonds for several decades now. And so, we've seen multiple cycles of rates going up and rates going down. So, we have some historical perspective on how this might play out.  There is certainly a lot of interest in the topic, and it's been a major focus of our communication efforts to talk about the importance of investment taxes. For a number of years, we used to do surveys of investors, asking about their thoughts on investment in taxes, and the results were always very consistent, which is that many investors appreciate the importance of taxes, but very few of them would say they understand what's involved. And increasingly, they look to their financial advisors as the source of information and guidance on tax efficient investing. And we think a great way for advisors to work with clients and add value, is providing information and solutions to help address concerns about taxes that they're going to be paying. So, we've done a lot of that over the years.  If you go to our website and look at our marketing materials, we have a fair bit on there about taxes. We have a calculator which \u2013 you enter where you live and what your filing status is and what your taxable income is and you can calculate what your current tax rate is. We're looking at expanding that, so that you can do a pro forma tax rate based on assumptions about where tax rates go.  But for us, it's a great way to get in front of advisors to help them educate their clients and demonstrate their expertise on something where clients know they need help on, know they need advice on.  Exactly how that plays out for us in terms of what products that is or how our product lineup might change as a result of that, it's still way too early to determine what that might look like. But, certainly, superficially, municipal bonds becoming more attractive at higher interest rates, Parametric custom portfolios, tax managed investing generally becomes more attractive at higher rates. And that's very much a focus of our sales and marketing teams going into the election is to try and help position advisors to provide good advice for their clients in that environment. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Eric Senay for closing remarks. \nEric Senay : Thank you. I've got to thank you for participating in our earning call today. And we hope everyone will stay safe and healthy. Thank you and have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Faust Jr.",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Since we reported our second quarter earnings results in late May, our business, our employees and the communities in which we live and work have continued to be significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all of our staff continues to work remotely. And that remains our expectations through at least the balance of this year.  Our employees have adapted quite effectively to working from home with minimal disruption to day to day operations and high levels of client service being maintained throughout the pandemic period.  The strength and resilience of our business in this difficult environment is testament to the adaptability and commitment of our employees across the company, for which I remain deeply grateful.  Since the sharp market sell off in March, the stimulus actions of governments around the globe and visible progress advancing the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics have fueled a recovery in financial markets. Over the course of our third fiscal quarter ending in July, we regained $39.4 billion of the $43.6 billion of managed assets that we lost to market price declines in the previous quarter. While the pandemic is far from over, markets are increasingly willing to bet that the worst is behind us and the economic recovery will continue.  Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, reflecting a $0.90 per diluted share reduction in the carrying value of our position in 49% owned Hexavest, together with $.07 per diluted share of income and gains on seed capital investments in consolidated CLO entities and other items that we exclude from our adjusted earnings calculation.  The reduction in the carrying value of our position in Hexavest reflects outflows-driven declines in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue, which accelerated the spring and summer following disappointing investment performance in the pandemic-related March market sell-off.  Throughout its history dating back to 2004, Hexavest has employed a value-leaning preservation of capital oriented investment style that typically generates its strongest relative returns during periods of market weakness.  Unfortunately for Hexavest, this year's market decline did not follow the usual pattern as value stocks significantly lagged growth stocks, both during the sell-off and in the market recovery to date. Reflecting net outflows of $2.7 billion during our third fiscal quarter, Hexavest closed the quarter with managed assets of $6.8 billion. That compares to managed assets of $11 billion at the time we acquired our position in Hexavest in 2012. Peak managed assets of $17.1 billion in 2014 and $13.4 billion of managed assets at the end of our fiscal 2019 last October. While we're disappointed that recent reductions in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue have necessitated writing down the carrying value of our investment, we continue to believe in Hexavest investment approach and fully support the company's management. Hexavest business remains solid and secure, and their talented investment team continues to engage actively in the markets, seeking to deliver value for their clients.  Turning to our core operating results. We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with $507 billion of consolidated assets under management, up 9% from the end of the previous quarter.  Across our investment mandate reporting categories, increases in managed assets range from a high of 12% for fixed income and 10% for Parametric custom portfolios to a low of 3% for alternative assets and floating rate income. In the third quarter, we had $2.7 billion of consolidated net inflows or $1.2 billion excluding Parametric overlay services.  The quarter's net flows were driven primarily by fixed income mandates, open-end funds and individual separate accounts.  Annualized internal growth for the quarter was 2%, as measured both in terms of consolidated managed assets and consolidated management fee revenue. That represents a sharp recovery from the prior quarters annualized internal growth in managed assets of minus 7% and annualized internal growth in management fee revenue of minus 6%.  Flow results generally improved as the quarter progressed, with July showing 13% annualized internal growth in managed assets or 4% excluding Parametric overlay services.  Looking at our third quarter flow results by investment mandate reporting category, fixed income net inflows for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which equates to annualized internal growth of 29%.  Within fixed income, the largest contributor to fund net inflows were our category-leading Eaton Vance short duration government income fund, with net inflows of $1.7 billion, high yield bond and municipal income mutual funds, each with approximately $650 million of net inflows and emerging market local debt bonds with $300 million of net inflows.  Fixed income institutional separate accounts saw over $1 billion of net inflows in the quarter, led by cash management, high yield bond and emerging market local debt mandates.  For the fiscal year-to-date, managed assets in our emerging market local debt strategies have increased 54% to over $2.2 billion, reflecting strong performance of our two five star rated mutual funds in this category, Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund and Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Debt Opportunities Funds, as well as initial success attracting intermediary and institutional clients in offshore markets.  Turning to equities, Calvert Equity strategies contributed nearly $800 million of net inflows in the third quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date, flows into Calvert Equity strategies have totaled more than $2.7 billion, generating 27% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the nine months.  Calvert Equity Fund and Calvert Small Cap Funds each contributed nearly $200 million of inflows in the third quarter, with Calvert Emerging Markets Fund and Calvert International Equity Fund together contributing nearly $175 million of additional net inflows in the quarter.  EBM equity strategies generated approximately $200 million of net inflows in the third fiscal quarter, driven primarily by privately offered funds and our Eaton Vance Investment Counsel wealth management business.  Atlanta Capital had equity net outflows of nearly $100 million in the third quarter as net inflows into their large cap growth and select equity strategies were offset by $420 million of net outflows from the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, their largest mutual fund, which has been closed to new investors since April 2018.  With net outflows since the fund's closure now totaling approximately $1.6 billion, the fund's board of trustees voted earlier this week to reopen the fund to new investors effective September 30.  The portfolio team at Atlanta Capital views it as a particularly opportune time to invest in the types of high quality stocks in which the fund specializes as these stocks have moved to attractive relative valuations.  Parametric had $3.1 billion of net outflows from equity mandate in the third fiscal quarters. This reflects the termination of a single $1.7 billion institutional covered call writing mandate and $1.6 billion of performance-related net outflows from Parametric systematic emerging market equity strategies during the quarter.  Parametric systematic EME strategies apply a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation that results in a structural underweighting to the China market, which has been a performance leader among the emerging markets over recent periods. The quarter-end managed assets in parametric systematic EME strategies consisted of $1.5 billion of US mutual fund AUM and $2.6 billion of offshore private fund and institutional separate account mandates.  Turning to floating rate income. Net outflows for the third fiscal quarter were just under $600 million, a significant improvement from nearly $3.2 billion of net outflows in the preceding quarter.  After a steep down draft in March, bank loan prices have now recovered most of the way back to pre-pandemic levels. With the recovery in loan prices, activity in the CLO market has also resumed. In July, we successfully placed a new CLO entity that closed earlier this week, which will contribute $450 million to our fourth quarter net flows. In our alternative asset mandate reporting category, net outflows improved sequentially from nearly $700 million in the second fiscal quarter to less than $50 million in the third fiscal quarter. The improved flow results are attributable primarily to reduced net outflows from our two global macro absolute return strategies, for which combined net outflows were under $50 million in the third fiscal quarter versus over $650 million in the prior quarter.  Net flows into our global macro absolute return strategies and alternative asset mandates as a whole turned positive for the month of July.  Parametric overlay services had $1.5 billion of net inflows in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $6.5 billion of net outflows in the prior fiscal quarter. Clients gains and loss contributed $750 million of net inflows in the third quarter versus $600 million in the prior quarter.  Changes in positions held by continuing overlay clients contributed $750 million of net inflows for the third quarter, greatly improved from $7 billion of net outflows from continuing clients in the second fiscal quarter.  Consistent with prior market downturns, we've seen continuing clients increasingly put back on their overlay positions as markets have recovered. After three straight months of net reductions in positions held by continuing overlay clients, net flows from continuing clients swung to the positive in June and improved further in July. With a $4 billion pipeline of new overlay clients expected to onboard in the fourth quarter and the prospect of continuing net inflows from existing clients, our overlay services business is poised for a very strong close to the fiscal year. Parametric custom portfolios had $470 million of net outflows in the third fiscal quarter, which reflects continuing positive flow results for Custom Core equity and ladder fixed income individual separate accounts, offset by outflows from institutional and subadvisory mandates.  What we sometimes refer to as custom beta individual separate accounts, which includes Parametric Custom Core equity plus municipal and corporate bond ladders, had $1.9 billion of net inflows for the quarter, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. The decline from $2.8 billion of net inflows and 9% internal growth annualized in the prior quarter primarily reflects the withdrawal by a single ultra-high net worth Custom Core client of $700 million to fund a major charitable contribution. Within parametric custom portfolios, institutional and subadvisory mandates had aggregate net outflows of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which compares to $650 million of net outflows in the preceding quarter. These net outflows reflect negative flow results for the underlying third-party managed investment strategies, unrelated to Parametric's role there as implementation manager.  We continue to view customized individual separate accounts as a leading long-term trend in asset management and an open ended market opportunity in which Parametric is positioned for continued dominance.  We recently announced the extension of the Parametric Custom Core franchise to include, for the first time, index-based fixed income strategies. Parametric Custom Core fixed income seeks to provide advisors and their clients with exposure to the fixed income markets they select, combining the benefits of index-based portfolio construction, active credit oversight, and direct ownership of securities.  Like Custom Core equity portfolios, Custom Core fixed income can be customized to reflect each client's individual responsible investment criteria and other desired portfolio tilts and exclusions to incorporate the client's preexisting securities holdings and to harvest tax losses on a year round systematic basis. Similar to our laddered bond separate account, Custom Core fixed income portfolios combined the rules-based approach to portfolio construction, with active credit oversight and available tax management. Different from laddered bond portfolios, Custom Core fixed income accounts seek to provide market exposures that approximate a client-specified fixed income index or combination of indexes.  Beyond Custom Core equities and fixed income, we see broadly-ranging future opportunities for Parametric custom separate accounts across multi-asset portfolios, applications combining active and passive management, and customized individual target date and target risk portfolios. The future remains very bright for Parametric custom portfolios.  In June, we announced the launch of Calvert ESG Research Leader Strategies, a new series of equity separate account offerings for institutional and individual investors. These strategies invest in the stock of companies with leading environmental, social and governance characteristics as determined by Calvert. Through partnership with Parametric, tax managed separate account versions of selected ESG research leaders strategies are available to serve taxpaying investors.  We also announced in June the creation of the Calvert Institute for Responsible Investing, an affiliated research institute dedicated to driving positive change by advancing understanding and promoting best practices and responsible investing.  Since we acquired the business assets of Calvert's predecessor company at the end of 2016, Calvert's managed assets have more than doubled, reaching $24.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. With $3.4 billion of net inflows into Calvert fund and separate accounts over the past nine months, Calvert has realized 23% annualized internal growth in managed assets for the fiscal year-to-date.  Among dedicated responsibly invested mutual funds, Calvert is far and away the market leader in terms of net inflows over the past 3 and 12 months, and ranks second currently in total assets under management. The strength of Calvert's brand as a long-term leader in responsible investing, combined with strong investment performance, and Eaton Vance's leading distribution presence in the US intermediary channel has proven to be a winning formula for Calvert. We see much more growth for Calvert in the quarters and years ahead.  During the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of WaterOak Advisors, a wealth management firm headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with approximately $2 billion of client assets under management. With a shared focus on high touch client service and a commitment to long-term relationships, the combination of WaterOak and Eaton Vance Investment Counsel will strengthen our position in private wealth management, which is an important strategic priority, and allow us to develop a much larger business serving high net worth individuals and families in Florida and throughout the southeast.  Looking ahead to our fourth fiscal quarter, we are optimistic that the business momentum we saw building over the course of the third quarter will continue to accelerate. We entered the fourth quarter with managed assets and run rate management fees well above third quarter average levels.  Net flows across our business have been quite strong over the month of August, with overall net flows, both with and without Parametric overlay services, back in the range of what we saw in our first fiscal quarter before the pandemic hit.  We have a robust pipeline of new business to fund in the fourth quarter, including the $450 million CLO that closed earlier this week and $800 million institutional high-yield mandates scheduled to fund in early October, approximately $700 million of Custom Core equity separate accounts in the pipeline, and over $5 billion of institutional portfolio overlay and LDI mandates scheduled to fund before the end of October.  Reopening the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund, our largest mutual fund, to new investors after a two-and-a-half year hiatus should also contribute positively to the favorable flow trends we expect to continue.  We believe there is considerable reason for optimism about the growth and performance of our business over the balance of fiscal 2020 and beyond.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. I think there's a reasonable chance that unless performance improves that it's an active strategy that competes against other attractive strategies in each of our businesses. If you if you can't deliver performance that exceeds benchmarks and peer groups over time, it's reasonable to expect assets to come down.  We have seen quite a bit of net outflows from that strategy. We think there's likely to be more stickiness to the assets on the mutual fund side perhaps than the non-mutual fund business. But certainly, for modeling purposes, we would assume that outflows there will continue. Ultimately, we're constrained by the amount of outflows by the assets that we have, which is down to just over $4 billion currently. So, there's quite a bit of, I guess, you would say noise. There have been announcements of a number of potential competitors that have interest in the space, public comments. In many ways, have been gratifying that people acknowledge that this is an area that provides value added for clients and many people perceive to have growth potential. In terms of what's happening in the marketplace as opposed to what we're hearing in announcements, there really hasn't been a meaningful change in competitive position. There's no new competitor that we're aware of that's taking significant share. We're not losing business being replaced by someone else. So, there's no evidence that any of the announcements are translating so far into changes in the competitive dynamic.  This is a business that we and many others expect will grow quite substantially over coming quarters and years. It's not a surprise that others will try and compete in this business, given the growth profile that is there.  I would say that our experience which goes back now several decades is that this is a hard business. It's not a business for dabblers, that there's a real commitment required to invest in technology, to invest in service and to invest in distribution to gain access across the markets.  So far, there haven't been any competitors that have emerged that we're worried about who check all those boxes in terms of the level of commitment and demonstrated expertise and technology and service and have similar distribution to us. But we think it will be a much bigger market. It's reasonable that there'll be more competitors. But we think that the position that Parametric has there is very solid, very strong and very secure. Certainly. We have the ability to respond selectively to competitors that compete on price. We will go toe to toe with anyone in terms of the quality and the value proposition that we offer as a leader in customized indexing. Competition in this space is not new. Throughout the time that we've been growing our custom indexing business, there have been other players in the market. The profile of those competitors really hasn't changed. The nature of the competition really hasn't changed. What has happened is that as the market has grown, its visibility has increased and we're seeing more conversation. But in terms of what's happening in the marketplace, we continue to compete as appropriately on price. We see nothing to suggest that we'll see wholesale reductions in average fee rates for this business. But we're certainly making the investments in technology and service and systems that will allow us to support a much bigger business and that ultimately will allow us to lower our operating costs, so that we can achieve attractive margins even at potentially lower average fee rates. Let me clarify, Dan. So, the comment what I was trying to make is that [indiscernible] for our August to date, this would not include any of the pipeline things that I talked about. We're seeing quite strong flows that if you exclude the Parametric overlay service business, puts us, we think, on pace for the same range of flows that we saw in the first quarter. Again, that's based on quarter-to-date results through yesterday and \u2013 through the day before yesterday, I guess. That is in the range of about, I think, $1.7 billion for our non-Parametric overlay business. You multiply that by three to account for the fact that we're less than a third of the way through the quarter. And that gets you sort of in the ballpark of the $5 billion of non-overlay net flows that we had in the first quarter.  Momentum is good. That includes strong sales with fixed income continuing, positive flows for equity, positive flows for floating rate income, positive custom portfolios.  As I mentioned, we're expecting on top of that a quite strong quarter for the overlay services business where we've got meaningful amount \u2013 a couple billion dollars plus of net inflows for the quarter-to-date, plus a quite robust pipeline of new business that we're expecting to fund.  All these forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt. We're only a third of the way through the quarter. Things can happen as we saw back in March. But, certainly, we're on track for a quite strong fourth quarter in terms of flows, supported by an excellent first month of that quarter and a visible pipeline of new opportunities that we think will likely support continuing flow momentum through the balance of this month and then through September and into the end of October and the end of the fiscal year. Starting with emerging market equities, systematic strategy, so they don't make market falls. So, think about this in the broad category of things as smart beta or multi-factor strategy. The premise of the fund is value added through diversification and rebalancing. The philosophy is a modified equal weighting approach to country allocation and alpha generation by rebalancing into underperforming countries.  That worked for a very long time. It has not worked recently simply because the China market has come to dominate the emerging market indexes both in terms of weighting, but also in terms of contribution to performance. So, a strategy that by design is underweight to the largest markets \u2013 in this case, China \u2013 is very much hamstrung in trying to perform in market environments which we've been in where you have sustained leadership of those largest countries in the index. So, we've had performance-related outflows. I guess you would say, in addition to the country allocation, given the rebalancing nature of the approach we take, there's an anti-momentum bias to the strategy that also has not helped during this period. But the outflows are, we think, going to abate. I highlighted that we're at $4 billion in assets. I think peak assets in this strategy were in the range of $20 billion. So, it's mostly behind us in terms of the outflows, with only a remaining $4 billion left.  How quickly we see that go away I think is anyone's guess. But we're certainly expecting based on performance that we've seen, as of current periods, still underperforming. So, we think it's reasonable to expect that outflows will continue.  A second part of the question related to the covered call writing business and what Parametric refers to as volatility, risk premium strategies that is monetizing the alpha that's created from the fact that options typically sell at a premium, where the implied volatility is typically higher than the realized volatility.  Those strategies generally perform well during trending markets when you collect your premium, but you don't get called away from the upside or have to buy in a position to avoid getting called away on the upside.  When they don't perform particularly well, as in the tight markets where there's a sharp upturn, which obviously is what we've had in the April/May period after the lows in March, so it's not surprising that we would see pressure on these strategies in market environments like this. Covered call writing is essentially trying to capture this premium that's frequently observed in the pricing of options. But it comes potentially at the cost of capping the upside in a sharply rising market. And when that happens, clients are prone to be disappointed.  After some period of clients taking off positions, I think generally we're in a mode of sort of neutrality to positive flows for our covered call writing business. So, I think that covers the second part. The third, which I don't really have information in front of me, it's like I'm going to have to guess at this. But did the quarterly flow results for equities reflect more a decline in gross sales or more an increase in redemptions? I would say \u2013 I guess I would maybe turn the question around, I guess, and say most of our business, the Calvert business had positive flows, the EBM equity business had positive flows, the Atlanta Capital business excluding the big fund there that's close to new investors had positive flows.  I would turn it around to say that the outflows that we saw in the equity category were very concentrated in the two things that I called out at Parametric. That being the covered call writing, the big institutional account that was lost there, the $1.7 billion, the emerging market equity strategies, and then the outflows from the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which was over $400 million.  So, in general, we feel our equity flows are good. A flash report through yesterday shows positive equity flows in the fourth quarter. And we certainly feel good about our ability to continue to grow in equities, subject to continuing pressure on that emerging market equity franchise that weighs against them. Bill, in terms of markets and where we're headed, first, I'm generally not too involved in those decisions with gatekeepers about asset allocation. My own market view is that the markets will likely continue to grind their way higher, given what we see as likely to be continuing positive news on the on the pandemic, particularly from a therapeutic and vaccine standpoint, more so than public health, and the likelihood that the economy will continue to be paused. It's certainly one of the things we're watching carefully, is US election and what that might imply for future tax rates, future regulatory and spending initiatives.  I think as most of our listeners are aware, we have a large business serving tax paying investors, which represent \u2013 some version of tax managed strategies represent over 40% of our assets, including municipal bond funds and tax managed equities. We're not exactly sure what's going to happen, but we certainly think that there's a reasonable prospect that, following the election, we could see an increase in tax rates, which could be a significant positive for that business. We compete primarily in high net worth markets for Parametric custom portfolios. For Custom Core equities, the account minimum at most places, I believe, is $250,000. So, the impact of fractional shares for someone that's putting to work $250,000 is pretty minimal.  There is the opportunity with fractional shares, and you've been reading about these, to do less customized or even non-customized direct indexing based strategies, which to us is not a particularly interesting product or interesting market, our perspective is that the value here is in the customization. And the cost of delivering customization is the service that's required. And to deliver customized accounts and high levels of service at the kinds of fee rates we're talking about and account minimums we're talking about is hard. And we're making investments in technology to put us in a position to continue to be a leader in doing that.  But I would say, broadly, the impact of fractional shares, while it will make it easier for us and other competitors potentially to go down market, the real name of the game here is customization. The primary value added for most investors, not all, but most, is tax efficiency, which is a concern primarily at higher tax rates.  We do see the business evolving in significant ways. I highlighted the fact that we've introduced Custom Core indexed products on the fixed income side. We certainly see lots of opportunity for product innovation down the road in terms of enhancing the features that we offer, expanding the array of capabilities, so that it's not just index based, but it's index plus active. It's not just equity or not just fixed income, but a combination of both. And then, very interesting applications potentially down the road in terms of target date or target risk, all customized to the individual.  So, we think there's lots of room here for lots of different ideas. The value added that we provide, again, is customization and service, primarily for higher net worth investors, primarily with the significant value add being tax. And some of the things that we're hearing about really just not relevant to that market and that market opportunity as we see it. We remain very interested, very close to the space, as you point out. We did file a second amended application with the SEC for our clear hedge method of what we call portfolio protected ETFs. I'm going to call it less transparent of active ETFs. We filed that last month. You can read that as indicative of positive constructive dialogue with the SEC staff. We certainly can't predict when or ultimately what they will decide, but we certainly feel good about the dialogue that we're engaged in there and are hopeful we'll get a \u2013 ultimately get a positive result.  The competitive landscape is really just beginning to emerge. I think there's five different concepts that have been approved by the SEC. We hope to be the sixth. Our business model here would include licensing our technology to others. We hope to compete on the basis of offering the highest level of assurance of strong secondary market trading, consistent with not having to disclose portfolio holdings or significant representative proxy portfolio on a daily basis.  So, we think we've got a very competitive mousetrap. This market is starting to develop based on the assets and flow numbers that I've seen. And we certainly want to have a place in that.  Like the other approved applications, our application, at least initially, is limited to cash and exchange-traded securities that trade during US market hours. So, think of that as US equities and US ETFs and Canadian and perhaps other markets that trade during the same timeframe as the US. So, it would be limited in that respect initially, which we think \u2013 frankly, quite reasonably, the SEC says, let's see what how this works for this asset class before we consider other asset classes. But we're very hopeful, very optimistic that, ultimately, this class of products and our application and our technology in particular will see application across all asset classes. And so, we continue to be very much optimistic about the future of actively managed exchange-traded products based on the potential enhancement in operating efficiency, trading convenience and tax efficiency versus ETFs.  And so, while we have a long heritage in the mutual fund industry, we are very committed to the development of customized individual separate accounts as an enhanced way for investors to invest in an array of strategies. And then, similarly invested in less transparent ETFs or portfolio protected ETFs as a way to do similar things through a fund vehicle with structural advantages versus a traditional mutual fund concept. No, we would be using our model as an alternative to the \u2013 think of clear hedge as a sixth approach, not something that would be an add-on to one of the other approaches. The only fund we have that's reopening is the Atlanta Capital S-MID Cap Fund, which is an important milestone for us. It is our largest and, I guess, by that measure, most popular fund and it's got a real strong following. And because it's been closed, we've seen fairly significant net outflows. I think I said $420 million in the quarter. So, once that's reopened, I would hope, at a minimum, we can stop the net outflows and potentially get that fund back into a growth mode again. It's not an open ended opportunity. We're potentially looking at closing it again, if we get significant net inflows. But at a minimum, we're hoping to abate the outflows there.  In terms of bank loans, it's an interesting position we're in currently. We are, I just said, modestly to the positive in terms of our bank loan flows for the month of August today through Monday of this week. But it's pretty small, positive, but closer to zero than some meaningful number. That does not include the CLO that I talked about as a big price this week. So, we're thinking that we've kind of bottomed out. We had a very rough quarter in the second quarter in terms of bank loan flows.  Yields here are pretty attractive. And I just checked this morning. The yield on our unlevered floating rate fund is about 3.6%. The modestly levered version is at 4.4%. And the version that has allocation to high yield is at 3.8%. Those are pretty attractive yields for a floating rate product in today's marketplace. Obviously, you've got to be comfortable taking credit risk because that's a component of this asset class. These are below investment grade securities.  But if people are generally getting comfortable that we've seen the worst in the economy and you look at what kinds of yields are available in other instruments and you start to worry \u2013 at least some people do worry \u2013 about the possibility that loan rates could be moving up and we may have hit the bottom in terms of where those are, you start to build an environment in which falling rate bank loans could be, again, an attractive asset class.  Our history in this business, which goes back to 1989, is that it's a business of cyclical growth, in which our pattern has been over market cycles. We typically hit a new high in assets and then people's rate expectations change and we see outflows or people get concerned about credit and we see outflows.  But we see nothing about our industry position or about the fundamental attractiveness of the asset class to suggest that we can't again regain the former highs in managed assets, which were in the, I think, mid-40s billions of dollars. So, that's not going to happen overnight, but we certainly think that we're in the bottoming stage or we're maybe coming out of the bottoming stage and are hopeful that we'll see an improvement in flows. But it's not happening yet. The good flows that we've had for August have been much more driven by fixed income as opposed to floating rate income with continued very healthy flows for our short duration government income fund, for our high yield strategies and for our muni strategies being the primary drivers of our income products flows.  The nice thing about bank loans is it's not a negative currently in the same way that it was a significant negative in the second quarter and a modest negative in the third quarter. We highlighted in my prepared remarks that we announced an acquisition of a $2 billion wealth manager in Florida called WaterOak Advisors. We announced it, I think, last month, and would hope to close that before the end of the year.  You should take that as a signal that we continue to be interested in expanding in wealth management. We're approaching $10 billion in managed assets there, including WaterOak after that transaction is closed, which is a meaningful sized competitor in the wealth management space and think that we have a lot to offer there and we'll look for other ways to grow there.  Other things that we find potentially interesting and where we continue to have conversations include private credit, which we view as a potentially highly complementary to our strong industry position and capabilities in the public credit markets through bank loans and high yield bonds. So, those are maybe two areas of focus.  We continue to look for opportunities to grow our platform in responsible investing, particularly if we can do that outside the United States. Calvert is today primarily a US brand that, in an ideal world, we could grow our presence in responsible investing outside the United States. So, those are some of the things we're looking at. That is frankly a challenge that, for investment grade muni ladders, there's just not a whole lot of yield available at current interest rates. One of the things we've been looking to do and are in the process of potentially bringing to market is a separate account product that includes a sleeve allocated to high yield muni issuance or corporate issuance for corporate ladders. That brings up the yield and does it in a diversified \u2013 an appropriately diversified way. So, it would be owning as a part of a ladder or a separate account structure, a sleeve dedicated to a diversified portfolio of higher yielding assets with the goal to bring up the overall income level for the portfolio in a managed controlled risk way. We've gone through this a few times. We've had a focus on tax managed equities and muni bonds for several decades now. And so, we've seen multiple cycles of rates going up and rates going down. So, we have some historical perspective on how this might play out.  There is certainly a lot of interest in the topic, and it's been a major focus of our communication efforts to talk about the importance of investment taxes. For a number of years, we used to do surveys of investors, asking about their thoughts on investment in taxes, and the results were always very consistent, which is that many investors appreciate the importance of taxes, but very few of them would say they understand what's involved. And increasingly, they look to their financial advisors as the source of information and guidance on tax efficient investing. And we think a great way for advisors to work with clients and add value, is providing information and solutions to help address concerns about taxes that they're going to be paying. So, we've done a lot of that over the years.  If you go to our website and look at our marketing materials, we have a fair bit on there about taxes. We have a calculator which \u2013 you enter where you live and what your filing status is and what your taxable income is and you can calculate what your current tax rate is. We're looking at expanding that, so that you can do a pro forma tax rate based on assumptions about where tax rates go.  But for us, it's a great way to get in front of advisors to help them educate their clients and demonstrate their expertise on something where clients know they need help on, know they need advice on.  Exactly how that plays out for us in terms of what products that is or how our product lineup might change as a result of that, it's still way too early to determine what that might look like. But, certainly, superficially, municipal bonds becoming more attractive at higher interest rates, Parametric custom portfolios, tax managed investing generally becomes more attractive at higher rates. And that's very much a focus of our sales and marketing teams going into the election is to try and help position advisors to provide good advice for their clients in that environment."

            "name": "Laurie Hylton",
            "content": "Thank you. And good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.82 for the third quarter fiscal 2020, up 3% from $0.80 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and down 7% from $0.88 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  As you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.83 per diluted share in the third quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of the $100.5 million impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in our 49% owned affiliate, Hexavest, the reversal of $8.5 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.6 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $0.2 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Adjusted earnings exceeded earnings under US GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2020, reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and the reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of $4.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.3 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and the reversal of $0.6 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  As Tom discussed in more detail, the outflows driven decline in Hexavest managed assets and management fee revenue over recent months prompted the determination that, in the third fiscal quarter, the company's equity method investment in Hexavest [indiscernible] temporarily impaired. Accordingly, the company recognized an impairment charge of $100.5 million in the quarter to reduce the carrying value of our investment in Hexavest to $32.7 million, which is estimated fair value based on the independent appraisal. As Tom previously noted, we continue to have faith in Hexavest leadership and confidence in our investment team and approach. As shown in Attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted operating income was up 7% sequentially, down 5% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.6% in the third quarter fiscal 2020 compared to 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020 and 32.4%. in the third quarter fiscal 2019.  Versus the prior quarter, average managed assets were up 1%. The management fee revenue increased 4%. The increase in management fee revenue exceeded the increase in average managed assets primarily due to a 2% increase in our average annualized management fee rate from 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter fiscal 2020 and the impact of two more fee days in the third quarter.  Although average managed assets this quarter were up 3% from the same period last year, net management fee revenue was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 31.8 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.3 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period last year was driven primarily by shifts in our business, from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.9 million, $2.5 million and $0.1 million to revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2020 and the third quarter fiscal 2019 respectively.  Management fees earned on consolidated investment entities, which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rate, were $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 respectively.  Turning to expenses. Compensation expense increased 5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting higher operating income based, investment performance based bonus accruals; higher stock-based compensation primarily driven by additional expense recognized during the third quarter in connection with employee retirements; higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, primarily parametric; the impact of two additional payroll days in the third quarter and higher benefit expenses, driven by a $1.7 million insurance reimbursement recorded last quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower sales based incentive compensation and a decrease in payroll taxes.  Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compensation costs decreased 1%, reflecting lower operating income based bonus accruals, lower sales-based incentive compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by a higher stock-based compensation and higher salaries and benefit expenses associated with increases in headcount, again, primarily at Parametric. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, were substantially unchanged from second quarter fiscal 2020 as higher private funds service fee expenses and marketing support payments were offset by lower upfront sales commission expense.  Year-over-year non-compensation distribution-related costs decreased 7%, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses for Class A and Class C mutual fund shares, driven by lower average managed assets, lower upfront sales commissions, lower discretionary marketing expenses, and lower intermediary marketing support payments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in service fee expenses and commission amortization from private funds.  Fund-related expenses decreased 12% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, reflecting lower fund expenses borne by the company, partially offset by higher subadvisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subadvised funds.  Other operating expenses decreased 2% from the second quarter fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting lower travel expenses, partially offset by an increase in other corporate expenses due to a one-time charge of $1.4 million related to a reimbursement to the company sponsored funds recorded in the third quarter.  Other operating expenses increased 5% from the third quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending and the above-mentioned one-time charge, partially offset by lower travel expenses.  Although we are continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company, we are otherwise focused on tight expense management and reducing discretionary spending.  In this period of volatility, we continue to benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results.  Non-operating income expense was up $105.7 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting an $84.2 million positive change in net gains or losses and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $21 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities; and a $0.5 million decrease in interest expense.  Non-operating income was up $26.8 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting an $18.8 million increase in net gains and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies and an $8 million improvement in net income or expense of consolidated CLO entities.  Turning to taxes. The US GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 45.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 25.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.  The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in attachment 2 to our press, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share remove the impact of gains, losses and other investment income of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, exclude the effect of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards and remove the impairment loss recognized on the company's investment in Hexavest.  On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 26.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.4% and 26.9%.  In addition to the Hexavest impairment loss previously noted, equity net income of affiliates in the third quarter fiscal 2020 includes $1 million of income earned from the company's investment in Hexavest, which was partially offset by $0.8 million of losses related to the company's investment in a private equity partnership. Substantially all of equity net income of affiliates in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal 2019 related to the company's investment in Hexavest.  We finished our third fiscal quarter holding $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $280.5 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flows during this period of heightened economic and market uncertainty to maintain our financial flexibility.  During the third quarter fiscal 2020, we used $41.2 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share of quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.7 million in the third quarter fiscal 2020, flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards due to lower market prices of the company shares.  Fiscal discipline, tight management of discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet continue to be top financial priorities for us in these unprecedented times.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Hi. It's Laurie. As we were looking at this quarter and last quarter, it really has been top of mind for us to ensure that we've got financial flexibility, particularly in terms of our liquidity. And I think as we mentioned last quarter, given everything that's happening on the global stage, we felt it was prudent to cut back on our share repurchases and we just continue to look at it quarter by quarter. But again, we're really just trying to ensure that we've got the liquidity necessary to continue to grow the business. I would certainly say there's always the possibility. I hesitate just given the volatility that we see in the markets to put money on anything at this point. But I do think that we're very comfortable in thinking that the year is going to be in this 31% range. I would not necessarily anticipate a significant uptick in the fourth quarter, but I do think we're very comfortable in the range that we're in. We really don't have any markers that I would say to look towards. We don't have a program for share repurchases. It's a discretionary decision. We have a small committee that thinks about this every quarter, and I think that we'll be considering all the possible inputs as we move out of our blackouts. So, more to come on that, but nothing specific to look for in terms of markers."

Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business, including but not limited to, those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Faust: Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by offering my sincere best wishes for good health to each of you and your families. Over recent months, we've seen a tragic loss of human life in nearly every country around the world, as well as massive disruption to the global economy and the world's financial markets. We see genuine heroism displayed by the countless healthcare workers, first responders and other essential service providers who are putting themselves in harm's way serving others. All of us at Eaton Vance are deeply grateful for their service. In recognition of the sacrifices of the COVID-19 heroes, and the suffering of those experiencing ill health or economic hardship due to the pandemic, the company and our employees have contributed $1 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts in our communities and around the world. In this challenging period Eaton Vance\u2019s primary concern are the health and safety of our employees and their families, the resilience of our business and serving the needs of our clients and business partners each and every day. Over the last couple of months, the creativity, adaptability and teamwork of our staff have been put to good use meeting the challenges of operating amid a pandemic. Since the middle of March, nearly all Eaton Vance employees have been working from home, connecting with each other and our clients and business partners chiefly through video technology. While not the same as being together physically, our businesses function seamlessly. We've not experienced any notable disruptions due to operational issues, loss of communication capabilities, technology failure or cyber attacks.  Throughout a period of heavy account activity and highly volatile markets, our trading and operations team have consistently kept up with unprecedented demand even while working from home. We don't take these successes for granted and recognize that our ability to respond to changing market conditions is a tribute to the planning and hard work of our technology and operations teams, the commitment and discipline of our employees as a whole and the strength of our corporate culture. Our resiliency is also a testament to the stability and longevity of our relationships with critical operations and distribution business partners and the benefits of the workforce, where turnover is low and working relationships are long established. From a distribution standpoint, our sales teams have adapted quickly to a world of virtual interactions with clients and intermediaries. With business travel shut down and in-person meetings canceled across the board, we are leveraging digital communications tools to remain connected. We have dialed up our digital engagement with financial advisors and consultants, increasing the frequency of calls, webinars and blog posts. We increased the update frequency of our popular Monthly Market Monitor to weekly in order to help clients and business partners stay abreast with the markets and stay informed about Eaton Vance strategies. And we are leveraging the Eaton Vance Advisor Institute to provide financial advisors with invaluable advice for connecting with clients in these unprecedented times. Financially, Eaton Vance's longstanding commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity has been well awarded. As of April 30th, we had over $950 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term income investments, $300 million of available capacity on our corporate credit facility and no debt maturing until 2023. Over the course of the quarter, we successfully demonstrated our ability to generate incremental liquidity if needed, and continue to closely monitor our financial resources on a daily basis.  In terms of capital management, we slowed the pace of share repurchases during the fiscal second quarter to maintain an ample supply of dry powder. During the quarter, we prioritized spending on initiatives that support future growth and create operational efficiencies. Turning to our financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted earnings differ from our earnings under U.S. GAAP principally to remove gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and the company's other seed capital investments. Adjusted earnings also reflect the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to the company's stock-based compensation. Combined, these adjustments added $0.15 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, subtracted $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and subtracted $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. By any measure, financial markets were challenging to navigate over the first two months of our second fiscal quarter, as the full scope of the global pandemic became apparent. Between the end of January and March 31st, the U.S. equity market, as represented by the total return of the S&P 500, dropped 19.6% and was down 30.4% at the low on March 23rd. During this two month period, we lost $72.5 billion in managed assets to market price declines. In contrast, in the month of April saw market related gains in our managed assets of $28.9 billion, recovering almost 40% of the market related declines for the first two months of the quarter. We ended the second quarter of fiscal 2020 with $465.3 billion in consolidated assets under management, down 1% from a year earlier and down 10% from the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Second quarter consolidated net outflows were $9.3 billion or $2.8 billion excluding Parametric overlay services. Excluding this business, our flows fluctuated from $2.4 billion of net inflows in February to $5.4 billion in net outflows in March to $200 million of net inflows in April. Again, excluding Parametric overly services, annualized internal growth in managed assets was minus 3% for the quarter, up 7% in February, minus 16% in March and plus 1% in April. Looking at flows on the basis of managed fees -- management fees generated, our annualized internal growth in management fee revenue was minus 6% for the quarter, plus 5% in February, minus 23% in March and minus 2% in April. Besides Parametric overlay services, which I will return to in a few moments, the primary driver for net outflows in the second quarter was floating-rate income index. Floating-rate net outflows for the quarter totaled $3.2 billion, about $2.4 billion of that occurring in March, as benchmarked short-term interest rates plunged and fears of recession related credit losses escalated. While prices fell sharply, the loan market did not experience interruptions in liquidity seen in other income markets during this period. Our floating-rate net outflows for the quarter were concentrated primarily in U.S. mutual funds, with institutional and sub-advisory mandates experiencing approximately $300 million of outflows in the quarter. Although loan prices have now recovered nearly halfway back from the March lows, our loan professionals believe the asset class represents exceptional value at current levels, given the historical default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate loans in prior periods of economic distress. Our alternatives category had net outflows of just under $700 million in the second quarter driven by outflows from our two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds, and the final liquidation of the Global Macro sub-advisory account that gave notice of termination in 2019. While not insulated from event risk, our global macro strategies offer the potential for generating returns that are substantially uncorrelated to U.S. equity and bond market returns, which can be especially appealing in an environment of high economic uncertainty. In equities, a continuing highlight of our business is the strong growth of Calvert which contributed $1.1 billion to equity net inflows in the second quarter, and $1.9 billion in the first half of fiscal 2020. Net inflows in the Calvert equity mandates were up 85% in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. In the second quarter Calvert equity funds had net inflows of over $400 million, Calvert Small-Cap Fund over $200 million and Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert International Equity Funds over 100 million on a combined basis. Calvert's strong equity flows reflect both the power of the Calvert brand as a leader in responsible investment and the outstanding investment performance of the Calvert equity strategies.  As can be seen on Page 17 of the slides that accompany this call, as of April 30th, 14 Calvert equity and multi-asset funds were rated four or five stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares, including five Calvert funds that are rated five stars. Atlanta Capital equity strategies contributed over $600 million to net inflows in the second quarter with both the Atlanta capital core equity and growth equity teams generating net inflows. Including the Calvert Equity Fund, which is managed by the Atlanta Capital growth team, net inflows into Atlanta Capital managed equities exceeded $1 billion in the second quarter. As in past periods of economic uncertainty, Atlanta Capital's brand of high quality investing holds particular appeal in the current environment. Flows into Eaton Vance management equity strategies were substantially flat, with net inflows into privately offered funds offset by outflows from other equity strategies. Parametric saw equity net outflows of $2.15 billion, driven principally by withdrawals from Parametric\u2019s emerging markets equity strategy. This engineered strategy applies a modified equal weight approach to investing in emerging markets, seeking to benefit from diversification and rebalancing alpha.  Relative performance for the year-to-date and over longer periods have suffered from a systematic underweight in China, by far the largest constituent of emerging market indexes, and a top performer among the emerging markets over recent periods.  Turning to fixed income, second quarter net inflows of approximately $200 million were driven by high yield bonds, short-term government income and emerging market local debt mandates, and high yield both retail funds and institutional separate accounts contributed to net inflows of $600 million. We're especially pleased with the growth of our institutional high yield business, with a pipeline of new mandates expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter now totals more than $1.3 billion. Amid an extraordinarily unstable period in the municipal securities markets, our muni funds and separate accounts had approximately $600 million of net outflows. In the second quarter, Parametric custom portfolios had $1.3 billion of net inflows, led by $2.7 billion of net contributions to custom core equity separate accounts matching first quarter net inflows of this Parametric flagship offering.  Net inflows into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates declined to approximately $250 million in the second quarter from $1.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting declining interest rates and bond market turmoil.  Within Parametric custom portfolios, centralized portfolio management mandates had net outflows of $1.6 billion during the second quarter, driven primarily by client decisions to reduce their exposure to equity investments during a period of high economic uncertainty and equity market volatility. Periods of extreme market volatility like we have been experiencing create significant opportunities for Parametric to add value to custom client portfolios. Declines in securities prices enabled Parametric to harvest tax losses that can be used to offset client gains realized elsewhere in the portfolio, either currently or in the future. We continue to believe that the value proposition offered by custom separate accounts for systematic tax means remains as attractive as ever.  Turning to Parametric overlay services second quarter net outflows of $6.5 billion compared to net inflows of $1.1 billion in the first quarter. The outflows reported for this category reflect decisions by continuing clients to lower their risk of exposure by reducing their derivative overlay positions managed by Parametric. These overlays functioned exactly as intended in this period of exceptional market volatility, enabling clients to quickly and easily shift market exposures without disturbing underlying positions and security by accessing the highly liquid futures markets.  Pointing to the value of this service in the current environment is the new client relationships established during the second fiscal quarter, and the sizeable pipeline of new overlay business expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter. Funding by new Parametric overlay clients totaled a net $1 billion in the second fiscal quarter, with a pipeline of over $3.7 billion expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter.  As we look ahead, we continue to focus on building on the distinctive strengths of our major business franchises to achieve positive organic revenue growth. Through Eaton Vance management, we're the dominant provider of fund solutions for concentrated stock positions, the leading manager of equity income closed end funds, and the largest manager of floating-rate bank loans. In fixed income, we have top tier positions in municipal bonds, higher corporates, and emerging market local debt. Parametric is the market leading provider of custom index separate accounts, municipal and corporate bond ladders, outsourced centralized portfolio management and portfolio derivative overlay services. Atlanta Capital is among the leading equity managers focused on high quality investing with a strong lineup of high performing strategies. And Calvert is among the largest and most respected specialists in responsible investing, number one in responsibly managed U.S. mutual fund flows over the past 12 months, and number two in managed mutual fund assets. As we consider the current environment, we see significant opportunities to build on these strengths even as competitors face a more uncertain future. While we don't know the path of the pandemic from here, or how financial markets will perform, we're pretty sure our industry will continue to trend increasingly in the direction of customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing, and specialty wealth management strategies and services, each an open-ended opportunity in which Eaton Vance has a dominant or leading market position.  Since the founding of our predecessor Eaton & Howard back in 1924, our business has weathered many storms, and I have no doubt that we will get through this one as well. As in prior periods of disruption, our goal is for Eaton Vance to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, a stronger and better Company. Based on the continuing high growth potential of our leading investment franchises, the strength of our financial position and culture and the resolve of our people, I have every confidence that objective will be achieved. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie.\nLaurie Hylton: Thank you and good morning. Our second Tom\u2019s hope that each of you and your families are healthy and well. As Tom described we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Effective this quarter, our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligation entities, collectively consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments.  Adjustments to GAAP operating income include the add back of management fee revenue received from consolidated investment entities that are eliminated in consolidation and the non-management expenses of consolidated sponsored funds recognized in consolidation. Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to Eaton Vance Corp shareholders include the after tax impact of those adjustments to operating income and the elimination of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments included in non-operating income expense, as determined net of tax and non-controlling and other beneficial interest. Our goal in making these adjustments is to provide investors and analysts alike a clear line of sight to the company's core operating results. All prior periods\u2019 non-GAAP financial measures have been updated to reflect this change. If you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings, exceeded earnings under U.S. GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2019 reflecting the reversal of $11.4 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $0.3 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $3.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.4 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $4.9 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. As shown in attachment 3 to our press release, our operating income as adjusted to include the management fee revenue and exclude the non-management expenses of our consolidated investment entities was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Our adjusted operating margin was 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 31.4% in the second quarter fiscal 2019 and 30.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets were $465.3 billion at April 30, 2020 down 1% year-over-year, reflecting COVID-19 related negative market returns partially offset by positive net flows over the last 12 months. Ending consolidated managed assets were down 10% from the prior quarter end reflecting sharply lower market prices and quarterly net outflows driven by investor uncertainty in the midst of the global pandemic. Although average managed assets this quarter were up 5% in the same period last year, management fee revenue was down 1%, reflecting a 7% decline in our average annualized management fee rate and 31.8 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate was partially offset by the impact of one additional fee day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the leap year. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period was driven primarily by shifts in our business mix from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Versus the prior quarter average managed assets were down 6% driving a 10% decrease in management fee revenue. Decline in management fee revenue exceeded the decline in average managed assets sequentially, primarily due to a 4% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter. Performance based fees which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates contributed $2.5 million, $1.8 million and $0.2 million to revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and the first quarter fiscal 2020 respectively.  Management fees earned by consolidated investment entities which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates were $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 respectively. Turning to expenses, compensation costs decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower operating income dbase and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation and higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, year-end compensation increases for continuing employees, and the impact of one additional payroll day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Sequentially, compensation expense decreased 13%, reflecting lower operating income based and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation driven by the impact of employee retirements in the first quarter, decreases in seasonal compensation expenses that are recognized primarily in the first fiscal quarter, lower salaries and benefits driven by two fewer payroll days in the second fiscal quarter, and a decrease in severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation. Non-compensation distribution related costs including distribution and service fees expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses and commission amortization for Class C mutual fund shares driven by lower average managed assets and a decrease in discretionary marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher upfront sales commission expense, service fee expenses and commission amortization for private funds. Sequentially non-compensation distribution related costs decreased 12%, primarily reflecting lower distribution expenses for Class C mutual fund shares, lower service fee expenses for Class A mutual fund shares and private funds, a decrease in intermediary marketing support payments, lower discretionary marketing spending and lower upfront sales commission expense. Fund related expenses increased 9% year-over-year reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subsidized funds. Sequentially, fund related expenses decreased 2% reflecting lower sub-advisory fees due to a decrease in average managed assets with sub-advised funds and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter, partially offset by an increase in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily respecting increases in information technology spending and facility expenses, partially offset by lower travel expenses, professional services and other corporate expenses. Other operating expenses decreased 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting decreases in travel expenses and professional services partially offset by increases in information technologies and facility expenses.  As Tom noted, we're continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company that are otherwise focused on highly expense management and reducing discretionary spending. In this period of volatility we benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results. Non-operating income expense was down $93.7 million from the second quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting a $65.7 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $27.5 million negative variance in net income of expense or expense of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. Losses related to consolidated investment entities are partially offset by related variances in non-controlling and other beneficial interests. Now our operating income expenses down $81.7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting a $66.6 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other income from the company's investments in consolidated sponsored funds and other sponsored strategies, $14.7 million increase in the net expenses of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. As a reminder, our calculation of adjusted earnings per diluted share now backs out the gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 45.3% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 25.1% in second quarter of fiscal '19 and 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $0.3 million in second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $4.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As shown in attachment 2 to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removes the impact of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and exclude the effective net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, 26.9% in second quarter fiscal 2019 and 27.6% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26% and 27%. We finished our second fiscal quarter totaling $951.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, and approximately $257.1 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility, while continuing to prioritize return of value to shareholders. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we repurchased 900,000 shares of our non-voting common stock for approximately $31 million and used $41.7 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, down 2% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases in excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercised employee stock options and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were down 3%. Fiscal discipline, tight management, discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet are among our top priorities these unprecedented times. We are well positioned to weather the current environment and are continuing to invest in our business to support future growth.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So just a follow-up on some of the monthly trends, certainly appreciate the additional disclosure. But can you talk about kind of the variance between March and April? And if you can comment about May so far with regards to gross sales versus redemptions in terms of the improvement, it was mainly just the slower redemptions or if you saw kind of gross sales also starting to pick up during those most recent months?\nTom Faust : Yes, Dan, this is Tom. The -- maybe somewhat odd thing about March was that although we had significant net outflows, as we described, gross flows were very strong, up approximately 50% from February to March. So it wasn't like there was no activity. In fact there was hyper activity on both of the inflows and outflows side. Things have slowed a bit on both sides of that thankfully. As indicated we had positive flow results for the month of April and May, have been -- I guess I would say May to date has been broadly similar to what we saw in April. So, we're -- we got hit pretty hard in the crisis period. We bounced back in trying to find this report. I was going to -- I can't pull it up. But we've stayed positive in March and starting May to-date with flows.\nDan Fannon: And then I guess just another one on flows. You mentioned $1.3 billion in high yield that's going to fund in the third quarter. I guess, just thinking about risk profiles and clients engagement, would you say that you're seeing kind of re-risking or just opportunistic where you have good performance or certain strategies that are doing well, you're seeing the kind of uptick. So I guess, just broadly, any other commentary on the institutional portfolio and kind of client behavior based on what you're hearing and seeing?\nTom Faust: Yes, I would say it's mixed. There are certainly clients that are looking at where risk assets are priced and where they have been priced and have stepped in, in some cases those might have been clients that were early to take off risk exposures. The fact that we're seeing high yield inflows I think is indicative of that, where we've seen a good period of -- we had actually a quite strong month in high yield in April, and we are as indicated expecting some quite important significant institutional flows. And I think you'd say in both cases that represents maybe I think generally sophisticated clients looking at prices of risk assets and concluding that from a long-term investment perspective that these are attractive entry points. We've seen some of that in bank loans as well, flows there have continued on an improving path in May. So we're -- they're not -- they're modestly negative but better than they were in April and vastly better than they were in March. So it feels like that our experience has probably been consistent with what just the trend of the equity market would suggest that people have been increasingly willing to take the view that we've likely seen the bottom of the cycle in terms of both stock prices and economic activity. And while there's obviously a lot of pain to be still absorbed, as we tentatively start to come out of the pandemic period, investors want to work through that and we see that in our core results, which have been certainly much better in April and our positive trend is continued in May for let\u2019s call it risk assets, so equities and floating-rate income, and high yield bonds principally would be exposure there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My first one is on the fee rate and I heard Laurie's earlier comments on the day count. But I was looking for additional color on the 2 basis point decline in both the equities and the all -- blended fee rate from last quarter?\nLaurie Hylton: Hi Craig, it's Laurie. In terms of equities, I think why we're seeing the decline is due to the net outflows that we've seen in Parametric emerging markets. Within that category tends to be one of the higher fee products. And then all it's the same issue. So it's just a question of product mix within the category.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And then just a follow up to the last question. Can you provide us an update on the bank loan business? I'm just thinking with very low interest rates today and rising corporate defaults in the U.S. how is this product sold to both retail institutional investors? And do you have any updated thoughts on the forward flow trend from this business? \nTom Faust: So, as I mentioned flows for May to-date have been modestly negative less than $100 million of outflows for the month-to-date through -- I think that\u2019s through Monday. So we're not seeing a significant continuation of the negative trend that we saw in March. The appeal of this asset class, I would say for many investors is from a total return perspective. As we pointed out, rates are absolutely -- benchmark rates are low, but spreads are wide. So in a place where it's -- in an environment where cash yields are zero, we're headed close to that, this asset class offers true floating rate exposure, so you can get high levels of current income without being exposed to meaningful amounts of interest rate risk, and also the opportunity for a significant price appreciation. Yes, and this is a big if. This economic cycle is similar to others where the experience of past cycles has been that the default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate bank loans is such that from current prices, there's a significant opportunity for price appreciation. Certainly no guarantees, these are risk assets below investment grade securities, but high current yield negative -- no exposure to interest rate risk to speak of, and a price that reflects still a pretty dire outlook for the economy, which again looking at the historical defaulting recovery experience of bank loans, this is proving to be a good price point for entry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt : Yes, just as a follow-up to Dan's question, I appreciate the pipeline guidance, are there any known offsetting redemptions to the unknown wins?\nTom Faust: Not really to speak of. Generally, you don't have a whole lot of -- generally there is not a whole lot of visibility on outflows. So, I wouldn't take too much comfort from the fact that we don't have a significant pipeline of outflows, but the fact is that we don't. We've said in previous quarters that we have a large bank loan client that for a multi-year period has been redeeming out of their position, that's not over with yet, but there is still some outflows there to go, but that's something we've been living with. I think in total, we're expecting, maybe -- in the range of $1.5 billion over a extended period of likely multiple quarters, potentially even multiple years, for that to come out. But that's really the only significant net outflow where we have visibility on. The rest of our business, I would say, generally we're not expecting to see significant net outflows, but we live in a volatile world and we don't always get a heads up when redemptions are coming, but the pipeline looks good in terms of outflows, but I'd take that with a bit of a grain of salt because that's generally true that there is not much in a way of outflow pipeline.\nPatrick Davitt : Helpful. Thanks. And then, obviously, the ESG investing theme continues unabated and obviously helping Calvert. Could you update us on any plans or discussion around perhaps backward integrating the Calvert process across the whole complex?\nTom Faust: Yes. So, that I would describe as well under way. I hesitate to say finished, but certainly well established. A priority for us, I'll say beginning two years ago was to integrate Calvert Research into the investment -- the fundamental investment processes of both Eaton Vance Management and Calvert, and to build systems connections and relationships among analyst teams and portfolio managers to accommodate that. So we've been working on this for two years. We have full access to the Calvert Research system and the Calvert Research analysts by all of our equity analysts and fixed income analyst and portfolio managers at both the Atlanta Capital and EVM, and that's been true for several quarters now. Like anything, the amount of inflow that has in our investment decision making is maybe a bit hard to measure. But certainly the connectivity is there and if you talk to our portfolio managers and hear them describe what we view with our competitive advantage is, the fact that we have access to this team of Calvert specialists, analysts who bring a very different perspective and a very different skill set than traditional fundamental analysts. It's something I would say that consistently, our PMs have been talking about for several quarters. It varies a bit by asset class, it's bigger in equities, but it's also becoming increasingly important in fixed income. The other place where we're increasingly integrating Calvert is relative to Parametric. Parametric is not in the business of making active calls on stocks or bonds. So, there's no fundamental process to integrate into. However, a significant part of the customized separate account business of Parametric relates to the ability to do customization to reflect client-specified ESG sensibility. To the extent that we can back that up with Calvert Research that we can provide with Calvert impact measurement that we can provide with collaboration and engagement with issuers, that strengthens the value of those Parametric offerings. And so, that's a -- I would say that's more of a current priority than something we've been focusing on historically and still some work to do there, but are optimistic that at the conclusion on this process that in Parametric, like Atlanta Capital and Eaton Vance Management, we will see a significant enhancement of their offerings in the marketplace, based on the connection, through Eaton Vance to Parametric -- I'm sorry to Calvert.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington : Maybe first on your changes to the reporting of adjusted earnings. So, it looks like the changes make this quarter's results look much better and prior quarters look a little bit worse. So, maybe a couple of questions around this. It looks like if the changes were not in place, your earnings would be $0.17 lower this quarter as per Page 10 of the release. I guess, firstly, is that correct? And then the timing of the changes seem a bit gimmicky. You took the benefit when it enhanced earnings and now that the CLO outlook has changed, you're adjusting up the losses. So, can you further flush out your comments on why this version of earnings is better than the prior?\nTom Faust: So, let me start and then Laurie can jump in.\nLaurie Hylton : Okay.\nTom Faust: So, headline earnings or GAAP earnings, excluding all of these adjustments, we earned $0.65. That's the top-line. If you want to go with GAAP, go with GAAP. We earned $0.65. This quarter consistent with most recent quarter, certainly over the last several years, every quarter, we've called out the contribution of seed capital investments and CLO investments to our earnings. These are investments that are mark-to-market, not all, but, I would say, most analysts that look through to try and uncover the underlying earnings power of our business have excluded those. So, we've called out the numbers in terms of earnings per share impact. A read of what most analysts report on our earnings have backed those out of our reported earnings. As you point out, during past periods, these were positive contributors, so that's consistent with rising markets. Absolutely, this adjustment here made our adjusted earnings higher then if we had included the -- then if we had not reflected -- sorry, then if we had reflected the losses in our business realized on seed capital investments and CLO gains and losses. We've also tracked competitors among public companies. What we're doing is fully consistent with what we think the prevailing trend is of other managers. There's a lot of disclosure here about the impact. And you and every other analysts have the ability to pick and choose. You want to the GAAP number, it's $0.65. You want to know with or without different adjustments, we quantify every one of them to its cents per share, and you have the ability to choose whatever earnings you want to choose that's being most relevant. We believe that for most people, not out -- but not everyone perhaps, the most relevant measure of our performance is what we're today describing as adjusted earnings per diluted share. Laurie, you might want to add to that?\nLaurie Hylton : Yes, I would just add, Ken, that we may be putting in tabular form and actually including it as part of our adjusted earnings calculation, but we have consistently been actually providing that information quarterly for quite some time. And I think as we were actually looking at how other peers were handling their seed capital portfolios, we realize that our parenthetically disclosure was not necessarily consistent with what others were doing. And then, quite frankly, if we were going to provide it parenthetically, we should just provide it as part of the reconciliation, and we thought it would be cleaner and it would be easier to get at. So that was the rationale for actually providing it in the adjusted number. And I do believe, as Tom said, that this is a better indicator from our perspective, the earnings power of the Company and it takes out a lot of the noise associated with consolidating large portfolios of products that quite frankly have very little to do when you actually back out the non-controlling interest, had very little to do with what our core operations actually look like.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then on the muni business -- the muni ladder business, to what extent is COVID-19 still weighing on the outlook for sales? Or is that business sort of recovered, like some of your other businesses that you highlighted?\nTom Faust: Let me just pull up some numbers. So, we have -- the...\nKen Worthington : The rational being it's a good business for you and we've got municipalities under pressure. And we can see what muni funds are doing, but the ladder business is sort of a different entity or different animal and it's been a very good one for you.\nTom Faust: Yes. I would say, that business has not really recovered to, I'll say, pre-crisis levels. We're not seeing outflows. We never really saw outflows in bond ladders during this period. But the first challenge we had, and this is more of a February challenge, was that, particularly in muni, rates got so low that income levels were not particularly attractive in investment-grade muni. So one of the issues we're dealing with is just when you layer in the advisor of the expenses at interest rates as they have been for muni sort of February timeframe, there wasn't a lot of income available. So that was one of the things that was weighing on it. And then as we got into March, yield picked up because muni spread versus treasuries started to gap out, but the muni market was not functioning particularly well during the month of March. And I think advisors were somewhat leery of but coming back to coming back to the asset class. So, it's been up. I guess, I'd say it's been up maybe partial recovery, but we're not seeing the kinds of activities that we did before. I am looking at -- for month-to-date, modestly positive flows. I guess, probably consistent with maybe a little better than the -- yeah, a little better than the trend of the second quarter, but not where we were in the first quarter and prior periods. So it sounds like it will -- it looks like it will take some time for that business to come back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: So, first, maybe on the Parametric overlay flows. Tom, you mentioned some of the drivers in the quarter as well as the pipeline of new clients. Just in terms of the current clients that derisked during the quarter, maybe based on past trends and these volatile backdrops, do you tend to see those clients like come back in and rerisk as kind of the markets start to stabilize? I just wanted to get some perspective on some of the kind of derisking that we saw in the quarter...\nTom Faust: Yes. A good question. So, we've, obviously, been through different downturns before, and it is not uncommon as we're coming into or going through a crisis period, when there is a lot of volatility in the market where institutions and that's who these clients are, will say I want to pull back from market exposure at some point. Maybe it's early before the crisis hit, as it hit, a little bit after the worst, whatever it is, it's certainly not uncommon for people to derisk their portfolios during market declines. And again, these are sophisticated institutional investors. So this is not a -- there's not a knee-jerk reaction. Primarily how these -- how this service has used, the biggest application, there are lots of other ones, but the biggest application is securitizing cash that's in client portfolios. So if you've got 3% or 4% cash in your portfolio that's not there for a particular investment reason, it's there -- maybe just I'll say sloshing around at the bottom of the portfolio, we've made the case historically that the best way to put that cash to use is using futures. So you're not disturbing the investments of the underlying managers who are running different sleeves of the portfolio, you have ultimate liquidity as to be able to take on or take off exposures quickly. So this is designed to be quick twitch asset movement positions that historically when markets go down you see people take off exposures, But I think, as your question suggests, generally as you get beyond the crisis period, particularly in periods like now and cash returns are nothing, that you start to see the resumption of putting back on positions by existing clients. There's certainly nothing in our experience or nothing in our communications with clients through this period that would suggest anything other than those positions are likely to come back over time. What's exciting for us is, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that this period has been a great reminder to the prospects -- some prospects we've been talking to for half a dozen years or more of the tremendous value of this service that if you put some of your assets in with us, you have the ability to, at very well cost and essentially immediately, to add or subtract market exposure consistent with whatever view there is of the policy committee or the CIO that's running the portfolio. Highly valuable service during this period, unfortunately, from our -- from a flow perspective, it contributed negatively to the reported flows. The revenue impact of that, I should probably mention, is pretty modest. Generally, the positions that were taken off were by larger clients, where incremental fee rates even relative to an overall average of 5 basis point for this business. In many cases, we're a fair bit less than that for those incremental assets that came off. Not a huge revenue impact, but because we report these as managed assets and they're included in our flows, we get to talk about them during periods when money is moving in or moving out of these exposures.\nMike Carrier: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Laurie, just expenses are well-managed and the margin held up relatively well. And I heard your comments on -- focusing on kind of discretionary expenses. In the quarter, were there any like unusual declines or items in the expense base? And then, just how are you thinking about the outlook, given obviously uncertain backdrop, yet fairly strong rebounding market? So, any context on how we should be thinking?\nLaurie Hylton : Yes. And just in terms of the current quarter, I don't think there was anything that was sort of a one-time item that we would call out. There is obviously just a lot of unusual activity to the extent that we no longer have people traveling, and we no longer -- just generally speaking, you're going to have some decline in just sort of discretionary spend, partially that's being -- because it's being managed very carefully and partially just because people are working out of their homes and there's just not as much activity. I think that as you're looking at the quarter, I think what's probably what's most notable is just the decline in certain categories from last quarter. And I think that the biggest of that is obviously compensation. And we highlight every year in the first quarter that we've got seasonal compensation expense that hits related to benefits that reset, payroll tax clocks that reset and stock-based compensation that we recognize in relation to employee retirements. So I think you'll see that notable decline in terms of, what I would think of some of the more fixed components of our compensation. But other than that, roughly [40%] of our costs are variable. So in periods where you've got the volatility that we've seen in sales and decline in average assets, we're going to go with that and that's going to -- and to a certain extent, that's a testimony to the fact that our cost structure is pretty flexible in periods like this.\nMike Carrier: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nLaurie Hylton : As to getting any kind of forecasting, I think I had to decline to do that at this point, because I just don't think anybody knows where this is going.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee : Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, and I hope everyone is doing well in these tough times. Maybe starting with the expense initiatives, Laurie, about kind of pulling back expense guidance per se, can you and Tom maybe update us on what are some of your new business initiatives you're spending on? I know there was Parametric, clearly and technology to kind of keep your technological lead there. But, can you just refresh us on some of the key initiatives?\nLaurie Hylton : Yes. I can start and maybe Thomas there wants to comment as well. The two big ones that we had, that we're currently undergoing, I think we've talked about number of -- on a number of calls, the first is, as you referenced, the operations and technology platform, Parametric. We are really making the investments there to build out that platform, recognizing the opportunity that we see just in terms of growth of that business in Custom Core particular. The other big one that we're well under way with right now is migration to the cloud. I think that, like many competitors, we're moving off of our -- out of our data centers and trying to actually move into cloud technology. So, we've got a relatively large project that's going there that we are going to continue to invest in. I think that we're at the tail end of most of our initiative to effectively get our trading platform standardized across the organization. So, we've done a lot with our fixed income teams getting everybody on to the same platform. And I think that we've pretty much gotten to the tail end of that, but there is still some residual work being done. I don't know if there's anything else, Tom, that you think that we should comment on.\nTom Faust: Yes. You highlighted the ones that I would point to. Certainly. the work at Parametric and the move to the cloud are the big -- the pretty big spend items that we've made the determination that these are strategically important to us, and they're going to continue. I would say also Calvert. as a business. is an area of obvious growth and growth opportunity for us. So there are Calvert-related spending initiatives that not necessarily technology-related, but just in general that continue to be reflected and will likely continue in the future, even though we're focusing on reducing discretionary spending. So, if you want to get funded or any kind of a project, two things, it's got to be supportive of business growth in areas of demonstrated pretty clear opportunity and/or quick payback cost savings. Beyond that, it's pretty hard to get new initiatives approved.\nRobert Lee : Maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, I think historically, you guys have watched in the -- maybe relative to some peers to try new things. And just kind of curious with that in mind, you do have your own version of these non-transparent ETF on file, not ETFM, but your other technology that you put out some announcements on that. Just maybe update us on kind of where some of that stands and if there are any kind of things that your -- other things you make besides Calvert, may be investing in, that you think are -- if you look a year or two or three down the road and you think to be new businesses for you?\nTom Faust: Yes. Thanks for that. I would just comment on the less transparent active ETF filing that was put in front of the SEC in, let's say, February of last year or may be January of last year. So, we've had a fair bit of back and forth with the staff there. I feel pretty good about the progress there and I think we're optimistic of a favorable outcome, but we certainly can't promise that that will be achieved and don't know the timing of that. But I feel good about the prospects of entering that growing field at a time and it's really just getting started. And I think the thing that we're watching about that space, maybe a couple of things, but the most important one I would say is on the uptake of these is, will sponsors allow the same or substantially identical strategy to be offered, both at the mutual fund and as an ETF. And there certainly has been a view at times that we've heard by distributors that causes concerns for them, I think primarily come up from a business risk management compliance perspective. There's certainly no absolutes there, but that was one of the things that slowed us down with NextShares. And if that changes, and I think there are signs that it may be changing at least at some distributors, we think that's a very bullish sign for the potential of these products. Obviously, the other key will be the ability to gain asset classes other than US equities. So far, all of the approvals have been just for US equities. And certainly, our ambitions, and I'm sure everyone else's ambitions in the space, would be to come out with a methodology that can provide for good assurance of good trading results in other asset classes where the challenge for efficient market making is greater than it is in US equities. So I think we're both increasingly optimistic about the potential of this business, having seen now a number of firms that are announcing products and apparently a better receptivity on the part of distributors to establish strategy. Our business, in general, remains very hard to bring a new strategy out. If you can take a successful strategy and make it available in what many people believe is a better structure, that has real potential. So, we're increasingly optimistic about that and certainly, very hopeful about our own ability to enter the fray with our patented technology that's in front of the SEC now. In terms of other initiatives that I would highlight, I think, certainly, Calvert is an area of a lot of interest from a new product development standpoint, lots of ideas. It was essentially a US mutual fund brand and our challenge -- our focus has been both to increase our share of that business and that really has been the driver of the growth to date of Calvert, but also to look for ways to extend the Calvert brand into other markets. And we started to have success in institutional and different approaches to investing, but those are, I would say, maybe two fertile areas of focus, the less transparent ETFs and Calvert generally. And maybe a third, I would add, is within Parametric, there are different ways of using and combining their customized individual separate accounts will be an area of growth and focus for us on new product development.\nOperator: Excuse me. Do we have time for one more question?\nEric Senay: Yes, let's take one last question. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is open.\nChris Shutler : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I hope you're all well. Regarding, let's see, so the core equity separate accounts, Tom, maybe just provide an update on how you see the competitive environment evolving over the medium term in that space? I know that direct indexing is getting a lot more attention these days throughout the industry, including from some of the large custodians. Thanks.\nTom Faust: Yes. So there is, I think, a fair bit of conversation about this topic, including some related to the acquisition activity just recently announced. The actual business that we're in, I would say, the competitive situation hasn't changed very much. There have been a few new competitors that have come in and they have a -- to my understanding, haven't really taken a lot of market share. I think our experience is, this is an easier place to put together an iffy brochure and in some cases, a nice looking website. But in terms of the blocking and tackling of customized individual separate accounts, literally delivering on the promise of customization, that means every account is managed separately. It's not so easy and I think one of the things that was demonstrated during the month of March was that this is not a business for the dabblers. This is a hard thing to do well. And we as the market leader, commit an enormous amount of resources and a tremendous amount of management energy and Parametric is focused on achieving a consistently high level of client service in all market environments, including the challenging environments like we went through in March. So it's more conversation about direct indexing, that term has entered the vernacular of our business. People recognize that one of the distinctive strengths of Eaton Vance is our leadership through Parametric in that business. Nobody had any real impact on reducing our market share. We're taking our business there. We continue to prosper in that business. But there's certainly the possibility, which we're very much open to that there will be more competition from credible players. By and large, we're of the view that, that can be helpful, because the visibility of the market opportunity is still relatively low. This is still a pretty small business in the range of maybe a couple of hundred billion dollars relative to index mutual fund and index ETF opportunity that many, many, many times that, trillions of dollars of assets. So, I think there is lots of opportunity. If there is going to be more competition, there is lots of opportunity for that competition to help drive market growth, not just take business from each other.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.\nEric Senay: Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we hope everyone continue to stay safe and healthy. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Faust",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by offering my sincere best wishes for good health to each of you and your families. Over recent months, we've seen a tragic loss of human life in nearly every country around the world, as well as massive disruption to the global economy and the world's financial markets. We see genuine heroism displayed by the countless healthcare workers, first responders and other essential service providers who are putting themselves in harm's way serving others. All of us at Eaton Vance are deeply grateful for their service. In recognition of the sacrifices of the COVID-19 heroes, and the suffering of those experiencing ill health or economic hardship due to the pandemic, the company and our employees have contributed $1 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts in our communities and around the world. In this challenging period Eaton Vance's primary concern are the health and safety of our employees and their families, the resilience of our business and serving the needs of our clients and business partners each and every day. Over the last couple of months, the creativity, adaptability and teamwork of our staff have been put to good use meeting the challenges of operating amid a pandemic. Since the middle of March, nearly all Eaton Vance employees have been working from home, connecting with each other and our clients and business partners chiefly through video technology. While not the same as being together physically, our businesses function seamlessly. We've not experienced any notable disruptions due to operational issues, loss of communication capabilities, technology failure or cyber attacks.  Throughout a period of heavy account activity and highly volatile markets, our trading and operations team have consistently kept up with unprecedented demand even while working from home. We don't take these successes for granted and recognize that our ability to respond to changing market conditions is a tribute to the planning and hard work of our technology and operations teams, the commitment and discipline of our employees as a whole and the strength of our corporate culture. Our resiliency is also a testament to the stability and longevity of our relationships with critical operations and distribution business partners and the benefits of the workforce, where turnover is low and working relationships are long established. From a distribution standpoint, our sales teams have adapted quickly to a world of virtual interactions with clients and intermediaries. With business travel shut down and in-person meetings canceled across the board, we are leveraging digital communications tools to remain connected. We have dialed up our digital engagement with financial advisors and consultants, increasing the frequency of calls, webinars and blog posts. We increased the update frequency of our popular Monthly Market Monitor to weekly in order to help clients and business partners stay abreast with the markets and stay informed about Eaton Vance strategies. And we are leveraging the Eaton Vance Advisor Institute to provide financial advisors with invaluable advice for connecting with clients in these unprecedented times. Financially, Eaton Vance's longstanding commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity has been well awarded. As of April 30th, we had over $950 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term income investments, $300 million of available capacity on our corporate credit facility and no debt maturing until 2023. Over the course of the quarter, we successfully demonstrated our ability to generate incremental liquidity if needed, and continue to closely monitor our financial resources on a daily basis.  In terms of capital management, we slowed the pace of share repurchases during the fiscal second quarter to maintain an ample supply of dry powder. During the quarter, we prioritized spending on initiatives that support future growth and create operational efficiencies. Turning to our financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted earnings differ from our earnings under U.S. GAAP principally to remove gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and the company's other seed capital investments. Adjusted earnings also reflect the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to the company's stock-based compensation. Combined, these adjustments added $0.15 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, subtracted $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and subtracted $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. By any measure, financial markets were challenging to navigate over the first two months of our second fiscal quarter, as the full scope of the global pandemic became apparent. Between the end of January and March 31st, the U.S. equity market, as represented by the total return of the S&P 500, dropped 19.6% and was down 30.4% at the low on March 23rd. During this two month period, we lost $72.5 billion in managed assets to market price declines. In contrast, in the month of April saw market related gains in our managed assets of $28.9 billion, recovering almost 40% of the market related declines for the first two months of the quarter. We ended the second quarter of fiscal 2020 with $465.3 billion in consolidated assets under management, down 1% from a year earlier and down 10% from the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Second quarter consolidated net outflows were $9.3 billion or $2.8 billion excluding Parametric overlay services. Excluding this business, our flows fluctuated from $2.4 billion of net inflows in February to $5.4 billion in net outflows in March to $200 million of net inflows in April. Again, excluding Parametric overly services, annualized internal growth in managed assets was minus 3% for the quarter, up 7% in February, minus 16% in March and plus 1% in April. Looking at flows on the basis of managed fees -- management fees generated, our annualized internal growth in management fee revenue was minus 6% for the quarter, plus 5% in February, minus 23% in March and minus 2% in April. Besides Parametric overlay services, which I will return to in a few moments, the primary driver for net outflows in the second quarter was floating-rate income index. Floating-rate net outflows for the quarter totaled $3.2 billion, about $2.4 billion of that occurring in March, as benchmarked short-term interest rates plunged and fears of recession related credit losses escalated. While prices fell sharply, the loan market did not experience interruptions in liquidity seen in other income markets during this period. Our floating-rate net outflows for the quarter were concentrated primarily in U.S. mutual funds, with institutional and sub-advisory mandates experiencing approximately $300 million of outflows in the quarter. Although loan prices have now recovered nearly halfway back from the March lows, our loan professionals believe the asset class represents exceptional value at current levels, given the historical default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate loans in prior periods of economic distress. Our alternatives category had net outflows of just under $700 million in the second quarter driven by outflows from our two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds, and the final liquidation of the Global Macro sub-advisory account that gave notice of termination in 2019. While not insulated from event risk, our global macro strategies offer the potential for generating returns that are substantially uncorrelated to U.S. equity and bond market returns, which can be especially appealing in an environment of high economic uncertainty. In equities, a continuing highlight of our business is the strong growth of Calvert which contributed $1.1 billion to equity net inflows in the second quarter, and $1.9 billion in the first half of fiscal 2020. Net inflows in the Calvert equity mandates were up 85% in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. In the second quarter Calvert equity funds had net inflows of over $400 million, Calvert Small-Cap Fund over $200 million and Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert International Equity Funds over 100 million on a combined basis. Calvert's strong equity flows reflect both the power of the Calvert brand as a leader in responsible investment and the outstanding investment performance of the Calvert equity strategies.  As can be seen on Page 17 of the slides that accompany this call, as of April 30th, 14 Calvert equity and multi-asset funds were rated four or five stars by Morningstar for at least one class of shares, including five Calvert funds that are rated five stars. Atlanta Capital equity strategies contributed over $600 million to net inflows in the second quarter with both the Atlanta capital core equity and growth equity teams generating net inflows. Including the Calvert Equity Fund, which is managed by the Atlanta Capital growth team, net inflows into Atlanta Capital managed equities exceeded $1 billion in the second quarter. As in past periods of economic uncertainty, Atlanta Capital's brand of high quality investing holds particular appeal in the current environment. Flows into Eaton Vance management equity strategies were substantially flat, with net inflows into privately offered funds offset by outflows from other equity strategies. Parametric saw equity net outflows of $2.15 billion, driven principally by withdrawals from Parametric's emerging markets equity strategy. This engineered strategy applies a modified equal weight approach to investing in emerging markets, seeking to benefit from diversification and rebalancing alpha.  Relative performance for the year-to-date and over longer periods have suffered from a systematic underweight in China, by far the largest constituent of emerging market indexes, and a top performer among the emerging markets over recent periods.  Turning to fixed income, second quarter net inflows of approximately $200 million were driven by high yield bonds, short-term government income and emerging market local debt mandates, and high yield both retail funds and institutional separate accounts contributed to net inflows of $600 million. We're especially pleased with the growth of our institutional high yield business, with a pipeline of new mandates expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter now totals more than $1.3 billion. Amid an extraordinarily unstable period in the municipal securities markets, our muni funds and separate accounts had approximately $600 million of net outflows. In the second quarter, Parametric custom portfolios had $1.3 billion of net inflows, led by $2.7 billion of net contributions to custom core equity separate accounts matching first quarter net inflows of this Parametric flagship offering.  Net inflows into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates declined to approximately $250 million in the second quarter from $1.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting declining interest rates and bond market turmoil.  Within Parametric custom portfolios, centralized portfolio management mandates had net outflows of $1.6 billion during the second quarter, driven primarily by client decisions to reduce their exposure to equity investments during a period of high economic uncertainty and equity market volatility. Periods of extreme market volatility like we have been experiencing create significant opportunities for Parametric to add value to custom client portfolios. Declines in securities prices enabled Parametric to harvest tax losses that can be used to offset client gains realized elsewhere in the portfolio, either currently or in the future. We continue to believe that the value proposition offered by custom separate accounts for systematic tax means remains as attractive as ever.  Turning to Parametric overlay services second quarter net outflows of $6.5 billion compared to net inflows of $1.1 billion in the first quarter. The outflows reported for this category reflect decisions by continuing clients to lower their risk of exposure by reducing their derivative overlay positions managed by Parametric. These overlays functioned exactly as intended in this period of exceptional market volatility, enabling clients to quickly and easily shift market exposures without disturbing underlying positions and security by accessing the highly liquid futures markets.  Pointing to the value of this service in the current environment is the new client relationships established during the second fiscal quarter, and the sizeable pipeline of new overlay business expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter. Funding by new Parametric overlay clients totaled a net $1 billion in the second fiscal quarter, with a pipeline of over $3.7 billion expected to fund in the third fiscal quarter.  As we look ahead, we continue to focus on building on the distinctive strengths of our major business franchises to achieve positive organic revenue growth. Through Eaton Vance management, we're the dominant provider of fund solutions for concentrated stock positions, the leading manager of equity income closed end funds, and the largest manager of floating-rate bank loans. In fixed income, we have top tier positions in municipal bonds, higher corporates, and emerging market local debt. Parametric is the market leading provider of custom index separate accounts, municipal and corporate bond ladders, outsourced centralized portfolio management and portfolio derivative overlay services. Atlanta Capital is among the leading equity managers focused on high quality investing with a strong lineup of high performing strategies. And Calvert is among the largest and most respected specialists in responsible investing, number one in responsibly managed U.S. mutual fund flows over the past 12 months, and number two in managed mutual fund assets. As we consider the current environment, we see significant opportunities to build on these strengths even as competitors face a more uncertain future. While we don't know the path of the pandemic from here, or how financial markets will perform, we're pretty sure our industry will continue to trend increasingly in the direction of customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing, and specialty wealth management strategies and services, each an open-ended opportunity in which Eaton Vance has a dominant or leading market position.  Since the founding of our predecessor Eaton & Howard back in 1924, our business has weathered many storms, and I have no doubt that we will get through this one as well. As in prior periods of disruption, our goal is for Eaton Vance to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, a stronger and better Company. Based on the continuing high growth potential of our leading investment franchises, the strength of our financial position and culture and the resolve of our people, I have every confidence that objective will be achieved. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Yes, Dan, this is Tom. The -- maybe somewhat odd thing about March was that although we had significant net outflows, as we described, gross flows were very strong, up approximately 50% from February to March. So it wasn't like there was no activity. In fact there was hyper activity on both of the inflows and outflows side. Things have slowed a bit on both sides of that thankfully. As indicated we had positive flow results for the month of April and May, have been -- I guess I would say May to date has been broadly similar to what we saw in April. So, we're -- we got hit pretty hard in the crisis period. We bounced back in trying to find this report. I was going to -- I can't pull it up. But we've stayed positive in March and starting May to-date with flows. Yes, I would say it's mixed. There are certainly clients that are looking at where risk assets are priced and where they have been priced and have stepped in, in some cases those might have been clients that were early to take off risk exposures. The fact that we're seeing high yield inflows I think is indicative of that, where we've seen a good period of -- we had actually a quite strong month in high yield in April, and we are as indicated expecting some quite important significant institutional flows. And I think you'd say in both cases that represents maybe I think generally sophisticated clients looking at prices of risk assets and concluding that from a long-term investment perspective that these are attractive entry points. We've seen some of that in bank loans as well, flows there have continued on an improving path in May. So we're -- they're not -- they're modestly negative but better than they were in April and vastly better than they were in March. So it feels like that our experience has probably been consistent with what just the trend of the equity market would suggest that people have been increasingly willing to take the view that we've likely seen the bottom of the cycle in terms of both stock prices and economic activity. And while there's obviously a lot of pain to be still absorbed, as we tentatively start to come out of the pandemic period, investors want to work through that and we see that in our core results, which have been certainly much better in April and our positive trend is continued in May for let's call it risk assets, so equities and floating-rate income, and high yield bonds principally would be exposure there. So, as I mentioned flows for May to-date have been modestly negative less than $100 million of outflows for the month-to-date through -- I think that's through Monday. So we're not seeing a significant continuation of the negative trend that we saw in March. The appeal of this asset class, I would say for many investors is from a total return perspective. As we pointed out, rates are absolutely -- benchmark rates are low, but spreads are wide. So in a place where it's -- in an environment where cash yields are zero, we're headed close to that, this asset class offers true floating rate exposure, so you can get high levels of current income without being exposed to meaningful amounts of interest rate risk, and also the opportunity for a significant price appreciation. Yes, and this is a big if. This economic cycle is similar to others where the experience of past cycles has been that the default and recovery experience of senior secured floating-rate bank loans is such that from current prices, there's a significant opportunity for price appreciation. Certainly no guarantees, these are risk assets below investment grade securities, but high current yield negative -- no exposure to interest rate risk to speak of, and a price that reflects still a pretty dire outlook for the economy, which again looking at the historical defaulting recovery experience of bank loans, this is proving to be a good price point for entry. Not really to speak of. Generally, you don't have a whole lot of -- generally there is not a whole lot of visibility on outflows. So, I wouldn't take too much comfort from the fact that we don't have a significant pipeline of outflows, but the fact is that we don't. We've said in previous quarters that we have a large bank loan client that for a multi-year period has been redeeming out of their position, that's not over with yet, but there is still some outflows there to go, but that's something we've been living with. I think in total, we're expecting, maybe -- in the range of $1.5 billion over a extended period of likely multiple quarters, potentially even multiple years, for that to come out. But that's really the only significant net outflow where we have visibility on. The rest of our business, I would say, generally we're not expecting to see significant net outflows, but we live in a volatile world and we don't always get a heads up when redemptions are coming, but the pipeline looks good in terms of outflows, but I'd take that with a bit of a grain of salt because that's generally true that there is not much in a way of outflow pipeline. Yes. So, that I would describe as well under way. I hesitate to say finished, but certainly well established. A priority for us, I'll say beginning two years ago was to integrate Calvert Research into the investment -- the fundamental investment processes of both Eaton Vance Management and Calvert, and to build systems connections and relationships among analyst teams and portfolio managers to accommodate that. So we've been working on this for two years. We have full access to the Calvert Research system and the Calvert Research analysts by all of our equity analysts and fixed income analyst and portfolio managers at both the Atlanta Capital and EVM, and that's been true for several quarters now. Like anything, the amount of inflow that has in our investment decision making is maybe a bit hard to measure. But certainly the connectivity is there and if you talk to our portfolio managers and hear them describe what we view with our competitive advantage is, the fact that we have access to this team of Calvert specialists, analysts who bring a very different perspective and a very different skill set than traditional fundamental analysts. It's something I would say that consistently, our PMs have been talking about for several quarters. It varies a bit by asset class, it's bigger in equities, but it's also becoming increasingly important in fixed income. The other place where we're increasingly integrating Calvert is relative to Parametric. Parametric is not in the business of making active calls on stocks or bonds. So, there's no fundamental process to integrate into. However, a significant part of the customized separate account business of Parametric relates to the ability to do customization to reflect client-specified ESG sensibility. To the extent that we can back that up with Calvert Research that we can provide with Calvert impact measurement that we can provide with collaboration and engagement with issuers, that strengthens the value of those Parametric offerings. And so, that's a -- I would say that's more of a current priority than something we've been focusing on historically and still some work to do there, but are optimistic that at the conclusion on this process that in Parametric, like Atlanta Capital and Eaton Vance Management, we will see a significant enhancement of their offerings in the marketplace, based on the connection, through Eaton Vance to Parametric -- I'm sorry to Calvert. So, let me start and then Laurie can jump in. So, headline earnings or GAAP earnings, excluding all of these adjustments, we earned $0.65. That's the top-line. If you want to go with GAAP, go with GAAP. We earned $0.65. This quarter consistent with most recent quarter, certainly over the last several years, every quarter, we've called out the contribution of seed capital investments and CLO investments to our earnings. These are investments that are mark-to-market, not all, but, I would say, most analysts that look through to try and uncover the underlying earnings power of our business have excluded those. So, we've called out the numbers in terms of earnings per share impact. A read of what most analysts report on our earnings have backed those out of our reported earnings. As you point out, during past periods, these were positive contributors, so that's consistent with rising markets. Absolutely, this adjustment here made our adjusted earnings higher then if we had included the -- then if we had not reflected -- sorry, then if we had reflected the losses in our business realized on seed capital investments and CLO gains and losses. We've also tracked competitors among public companies. What we're doing is fully consistent with what we think the prevailing trend is of other managers. There's a lot of disclosure here about the impact. And you and every other analysts have the ability to pick and choose. You want to the GAAP number, it's $0.65. You want to know with or without different adjustments, we quantify every one of them to its cents per share, and you have the ability to choose whatever earnings you want to choose that's being most relevant. We believe that for most people, not out -- but not everyone perhaps, the most relevant measure of our performance is what we're today describing as adjusted earnings per diluted share. Laurie, you might want to add to that? Let me just pull up some numbers. So, we have -- the... Yes. I would say, that business has not really recovered to, I'll say, pre-crisis levels. We're not seeing outflows. We never really saw outflows in bond ladders during this period. But the first challenge we had, and this is more of a February challenge, was that, particularly in muni, rates got so low that income levels were not particularly attractive in investment-grade muni. So one of the issues we're dealing with is just when you layer in the advisor of the expenses at interest rates as they have been for muni sort of February timeframe, there wasn't a lot of income available. So that was one of the things that was weighing on it. And then as we got into March, yield picked up because muni spread versus treasuries started to gap out, but the muni market was not functioning particularly well during the month of March. And I think advisors were somewhat leery of but coming back to coming back to the asset class. So, it's been up. I guess, I'd say it's been up maybe partial recovery, but we're not seeing the kinds of activities that we did before. I am looking at -- for month-to-date, modestly positive flows. I guess, probably consistent with maybe a little better than the -- yeah, a little better than the trend of the second quarter, but not where we were in the first quarter and prior periods. So it sounds like it will -- it looks like it will take some time for that business to come back. Yes. A good question. So, we've, obviously, been through different downturns before, and it is not uncommon as we're coming into or going through a crisis period, when there is a lot of volatility in the market where institutions and that's who these clients are, will say I want to pull back from market exposure at some point. Maybe it's early before the crisis hit, as it hit, a little bit after the worst, whatever it is, it's certainly not uncommon for people to derisk their portfolios during market declines. And again, these are sophisticated institutional investors. So this is not a -- there's not a knee-jerk reaction. Primarily how these -- how this service has used, the biggest application, there are lots of other ones, but the biggest application is securitizing cash that's in client portfolios. So if you've got 3% or 4% cash in your portfolio that's not there for a particular investment reason, it's there -- maybe just I'll say sloshing around at the bottom of the portfolio, we've made the case historically that the best way to put that cash to use is using futures. So you're not disturbing the investments of the underlying managers who are running different sleeves of the portfolio, you have ultimate liquidity as to be able to take on or take off exposures quickly. So this is designed to be quick twitch asset movement positions that historically when markets go down you see people take off exposures, But I think, as your question suggests, generally as you get beyond the crisis period, particularly in periods like now and cash returns are nothing, that you start to see the resumption of putting back on positions by existing clients. There's certainly nothing in our experience or nothing in our communications with clients through this period that would suggest anything other than those positions are likely to come back over time. What's exciting for us is, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that this period has been a great reminder to the prospects -- some prospects we've been talking to for half a dozen years or more of the tremendous value of this service that if you put some of your assets in with us, you have the ability to, at very well cost and essentially immediately, to add or subtract market exposure consistent with whatever view there is of the policy committee or the CIO that's running the portfolio. Highly valuable service during this period, unfortunately, from our -- from a flow perspective, it contributed negatively to the reported flows. The revenue impact of that, I should probably mention, is pretty modest. Generally, the positions that were taken off were by larger clients, where incremental fee rates even relative to an overall average of 5 basis point for this business. In many cases, we're a fair bit less than that for those incremental assets that came off. Not a huge revenue impact, but because we report these as managed assets and they're included in our flows, we get to talk about them during periods when money is moving in or moving out of these exposures. Yes. You highlighted the ones that I would point to. Certainly. the work at Parametric and the move to the cloud are the big -- the pretty big spend items that we've made the determination that these are strategically important to us, and they're going to continue. I would say also Calvert. as a business. is an area of obvious growth and growth opportunity for us. So there are Calvert-related spending initiatives that not necessarily technology-related, but just in general that continue to be reflected and will likely continue in the future, even though we're focusing on reducing discretionary spending. So, if you want to get funded or any kind of a project, two things, it's got to be supportive of business growth in areas of demonstrated pretty clear opportunity and/or quick payback cost savings. Beyond that, it's pretty hard to get new initiatives approved. Yes. Thanks for that. I would just comment on the less transparent active ETF filing that was put in front of the SEC in, let's say, February of last year or may be January of last year. So, we've had a fair bit of back and forth with the staff there. I feel pretty good about the progress there and I think we're optimistic of a favorable outcome, but we certainly can't promise that that will be achieved and don't know the timing of that. But I feel good about the prospects of entering that growing field at a time and it's really just getting started. And I think the thing that we're watching about that space, maybe a couple of things, but the most important one I would say is on the uptake of these is, will sponsors allow the same or substantially identical strategy to be offered, both at the mutual fund and as an ETF. And there certainly has been a view at times that we've heard by distributors that causes concerns for them, I think primarily come up from a business risk management compliance perspective. There's certainly no absolutes there, but that was one of the things that slowed us down with NextShares. And if that changes, and I think there are signs that it may be changing at least at some distributors, we think that's a very bullish sign for the potential of these products. Obviously, the other key will be the ability to gain asset classes other than US equities. So far, all of the approvals have been just for US equities. And certainly, our ambitions, and I'm sure everyone else's ambitions in the space, would be to come out with a methodology that can provide for good assurance of good trading results in other asset classes where the challenge for efficient market making is greater than it is in US equities. So I think we're both increasingly optimistic about the potential of this business, having seen now a number of firms that are announcing products and apparently a better receptivity on the part of distributors to establish strategy. Our business, in general, remains very hard to bring a new strategy out. If you can take a successful strategy and make it available in what many people believe is a better structure, that has real potential. So, we're increasingly optimistic about that and certainly, very hopeful about our own ability to enter the fray with our patented technology that's in front of the SEC now. In terms of other initiatives that I would highlight, I think, certainly, Calvert is an area of a lot of interest from a new product development standpoint, lots of ideas. It was essentially a US mutual fund brand and our challenge -- our focus has been both to increase our share of that business and that really has been the driver of the growth to date of Calvert, but also to look for ways to extend the Calvert brand into other markets. And we started to have success in institutional and different approaches to investing, but those are, I would say, maybe two fertile areas of focus, the less transparent ETFs and Calvert generally. And maybe a third, I would add, is within Parametric, there are different ways of using and combining their customized individual separate accounts will be an area of growth and focus for us on new product development. Yes. So there is, I think, a fair bit of conversation about this topic, including some related to the acquisition activity just recently announced. The actual business that we're in, I would say, the competitive situation hasn't changed very much. There have been a few new competitors that have come in and they have a -- to my understanding, haven't really taken a lot of market share. I think our experience is, this is an easier place to put together an iffy brochure and in some cases, a nice looking website. But in terms of the blocking and tackling of customized individual separate accounts, literally delivering on the promise of customization, that means every account is managed separately. It's not so easy and I think one of the things that was demonstrated during the month of March was that this is not a business for the dabblers. This is a hard thing to do well. And we as the market leader, commit an enormous amount of resources and a tremendous amount of management energy and Parametric is focused on achieving a consistently high level of client service in all market environments, including the challenging environments like we went through in March. So it's more conversation about direct indexing, that term has entered the vernacular of our business. People recognize that one of the distinctive strengths of Eaton Vance is our leadership through Parametric in that business. Nobody had any real impact on reducing our market share. We're taking our business there. We continue to prosper in that business. But there's certainly the possibility, which we're very much open to that there will be more competition from credible players. By and large, we're of the view that, that can be helpful, because the visibility of the market opportunity is still relatively low. This is still a pretty small business in the range of maybe a couple of hundred billion dollars relative to index mutual fund and index ETF opportunity that many, many, many times that, trillions of dollars of assets. So, I think there is lots of opportunity. If there is going to be more competition, there is lots of opportunity for that competition to help drive market growth, not just take business from each other."

            "name": "Laurie Hylton",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. Our second Tom's hope that each of you and your families are healthy and well. As Tom described we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.80 for the second quarter fiscal 2020, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 6% from $0.85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Effective this quarter, our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored funds and consolidated collateralized loan obligation entities, collectively consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments.  Adjustments to GAAP operating income include the add back of management fee revenue received from consolidated investment entities that are eliminated in consolidation and the non-management expenses of consolidated sponsored funds recognized in consolidation. Adjustments to GAAP net income attributable to Eaton Vance Corp shareholders include the after tax impact of those adjustments to operating income and the elimination of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments included in non-operating income expense, as determined net of tax and non-controlling and other beneficial interest. Our goal in making these adjustments is to provide investors and analysts alike a clear line of sight to the company's core operating results. All prior periods' non-GAAP financial measures have been updated to reflect this change. If you can see in attachment 2 to our press release, adjusted earnings, exceeded earnings under U.S. GAAP by $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $16.8 million of net losses of consolidated investment entities and our other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $1.1 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards.  Earnings under US GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter fiscal 2019 reflecting the reversal of $11.4 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $1.8 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $0.3 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 reflecting the reversal of $3.6 million of net gains of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, the add back of $2.4 million of management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities, and reversal of $4.9 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. As shown in attachment 3 to our press release, our operating income as adjusted to include the management fee revenue and exclude the non-management expenses of our consolidated investment entities was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Our adjusted operating margin was 30.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 31.4% in the second quarter fiscal 2019 and 30.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets were $465.3 billion at April 30, 2020 down 1% year-over-year, reflecting COVID-19 related negative market returns partially offset by positive net flows over the last 12 months. Ending consolidated managed assets were down 10% from the prior quarter end reflecting sharply lower market prices and quarterly net outflows driven by investor uncertainty in the midst of the global pandemic. Although average managed assets this quarter were up 5% in the same period last year, management fee revenue was down 1%, reflecting a 7% decline in our average annualized management fee rate and 31.8 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate was partially offset by the impact of one additional fee day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the leap year. The decline in our average annualized management fee rate versus the comparative period was driven primarily by shifts in our business mix from higher fee to lower fee mandates. Versus the prior quarter average managed assets were down 6% driving a 10% decrease in management fee revenue. Decline in management fee revenue exceeded the decline in average managed assets sequentially, primarily due to a 4% decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 29.7 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter. Performance based fees which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates contributed $2.5 million, $1.8 million and $0.2 million to revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and the first quarter fiscal 2020 respectively.  Management fees earned by consolidated investment entities which are eliminated in consolidation and excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates were $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the second quarter fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 respectively. Turning to expenses, compensation costs decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower operating income dbase and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation and lower severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation and higher salaries associated with increases in headcount, year-end compensation increases for continuing employees, and the impact of one additional payroll day in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Sequentially, compensation expense decreased 13%, reflecting lower operating income based and investment performance based bonus accruals, lower stock based compensation driven by the impact of employee retirements in the first quarter, decreases in seasonal compensation expenses that are recognized primarily in the first fiscal quarter, lower salaries and benefits driven by two fewer payroll days in the second fiscal quarter, and a decrease in severance costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales based incentive compensation. Non-compensation distribution related costs including distribution and service fees expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower distribution and service fee expenses and commission amortization for Class C mutual fund shares driven by lower average managed assets and a decrease in discretionary marketing expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher upfront sales commission expense, service fee expenses and commission amortization for private funds. Sequentially non-compensation distribution related costs decreased 12%, primarily reflecting lower distribution expenses for Class C mutual fund shares, lower service fee expenses for Class A mutual fund shares and private funds, a decrease in intermediary marketing support payments, lower discretionary marketing spending and lower upfront sales commission expense. Fund related expenses increased 9% year-over-year reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of subsidized funds. Sequentially, fund related expenses decreased 2% reflecting lower sub-advisory fees due to a decrease in average managed assets with sub-advised funds and the impact of two fewer fee days in the second quarter, partially offset by an increase in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily respecting increases in information technology spending and facility expenses, partially offset by lower travel expenses, professional services and other corporate expenses. Other operating expenses decreased 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting decreases in travel expenses and professional services partially offset by increases in information technologies and facility expenses.  As Tom noted, we're continuing to invest in areas that are important for the future growth of the company that are otherwise focused on highly expense management and reducing discretionary spending. In this period of volatility we benefit greatly from the fact that more than 40% of our operating expenses are variable in nature, moving up and down with changes in operating income, managed assets or sales results. Non-operating income expense was down $93.7 million from the second quarter fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting a $65.7 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other investment income of consolidated sponsored funds and the company's investments in other sponsored strategies, a $27.5 million negative variance in net income of expense or expense of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. Losses related to consolidated investment entities are partially offset by related variances in non-controlling and other beneficial interests. Now our operating income expenses down $81.7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting a $66.6 million negative variance in net gain or loss and other income from the company's investments in consolidated sponsored funds and other sponsored strategies, $14.7 million increase in the net expenses of consolidated CLO entities and $0.5 million increase in interest expense. As a reminder, our calculation of adjusted earnings per diluted share now backs out the gains and losses and other impacts of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 45.3% in the second quarter fiscal 2020, 25.1% in second quarter of fiscal '19 and 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The company's income tax provision was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $0.3 million in second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $4.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As shown in attachment 2 to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removes the impact of gains, losses and other investment income expense of consolidated investment entities and other seed capital investments, add back the management fees and expenses of consolidated investment entities and exclude the effective net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, 26.9% in second quarter fiscal 2019 and 27.6% in the first quarter fiscal 2020. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26% and 27%. We finished our second fiscal quarter totaling $951.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, and approximately $257.1 million in seed capital investments. We are carefully managing our cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility, while continuing to prioritize return of value to shareholders. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we repurchased 900,000 shares of our non-voting common stock for approximately $31 million and used $41.7 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 111.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, down 2% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases in excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercised employee stock options and a decrease in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were down 3%. Fiscal discipline, tight management, discretionary spending and maintaining a strong balance sheet are among our top priorities these unprecedented times. We are well positioned to weather the current environment and are continuing to invest in our business to support future growth.  This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Hi Craig, it's Laurie. In terms of equities, I think why we're seeing the decline is due to the net outflows that we've seen in Parametric emerging markets. Within that category tends to be one of the higher fee products. And then all it's the same issue. So it's just a question of product mix within the category. Okay. Yes, I would just add, Ken, that we may be putting in tabular form and actually including it as part of our adjusted earnings calculation, but we have consistently been actually providing that information quarterly for quite some time. And I think as we were actually looking at how other peers were handling their seed capital portfolios, we realize that our parenthetically disclosure was not necessarily consistent with what others were doing. And then, quite frankly, if we were going to provide it parenthetically, we should just provide it as part of the reconciliation, and we thought it would be cleaner and it would be easier to get at. So that was the rationale for actually providing it in the adjusted number. And I do believe, as Tom said, that this is a better indicator from our perspective, the earnings power of the Company and it takes out a lot of the noise associated with consolidating large portfolios of products that quite frankly have very little to do when you actually back out the non-controlling interest, had very little to do with what our core operations actually look like. Yes. And just in terms of the current quarter, I don't think there was anything that was sort of a one-time item that we would call out. There is obviously just a lot of unusual activity to the extent that we no longer have people traveling, and we no longer -- just generally speaking, you're going to have some decline in just sort of discretionary spend, partially that's being -- because it's being managed very carefully and partially just because people are working out of their homes and there's just not as much activity. I think that as you're looking at the quarter, I think what's probably what's most notable is just the decline in certain categories from last quarter. And I think that the biggest of that is obviously compensation. And we highlight every year in the first quarter that we've got seasonal compensation expense that hits related to benefits that reset, payroll tax clocks that reset and stock-based compensation that we recognize in relation to employee retirements. So I think you'll see that notable decline in terms of, what I would think of some of the more fixed components of our compensation. But other than that, roughly [40%] of our costs are variable. So in periods where you've got the volatility that we've seen in sales and decline in average assets, we're going to go with that and that's going to -- and to a certain extent, that's a testimony to the fact that our cost structure is pretty flexible in periods like this. As to getting any kind of forecasting, I think I had to decline to do that at this point, because I just don't think anybody knows where this is going. Yes. I can start and maybe Thomas there wants to comment as well. The two big ones that we had, that we're currently undergoing, I think we've talked about number of -- on a number of calls, the first is, as you referenced, the operations and technology platform, Parametric. We are really making the investments there to build out that platform, recognizing the opportunity that we see just in terms of growth of that business in Custom Core particular. The other big one that we're well under way with right now is migration to the cloud. I think that, like many competitors, we're moving off of our -- out of our data centers and trying to actually move into cloud technology. So, we've got a relatively large project that's going there that we are going to continue to invest in. I think that we're at the tail end of most of our initiative to effectively get our trading platform standardized across the organization. So, we've done a lot with our fixed income teams getting everybody on to the same platform. And I think that we've pretty much gotten to the tail end of that, but there is still some residual work being done. I don't know if there's anything else, Tom, that you think that we should comment on."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Eric Senay, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nEric Senay: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings call and webcast. With me this morning are Tom Faust, Chairman and CEO of Eaton Vance; as well as our CFO, Laurie Hylton. In today's call, we will first comment on the quarter and fiscal year and then take your questions. As always, the full earnings release and charts we will refer to during the call are available on our website eatonvance.com under the heading Investor Relations. And today's presentation contain forward-looking statements about our business and financial results. The actual results may differ materially from those projected due to risks and uncertainties in our business including but not limited to those discussed in our SEC filings. These filings including our 2019 Annual Report and Form 10-K are available on our website or upon request at no charge. I will now turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Faust: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported $0.86 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which is up 18% from $0.73 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 9% from $0.95 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On a combined basis seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments contributed $0.03 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and negative $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.08 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding these items, first quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share were up 11% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. We ended the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with $518.2 billion of consolidated assets under management which is up 17% from a year ago and up 4% from the previous quarter end. First quarter consolidated net inflows were $6.1 billion or $5 billion excluding what we now call Parametric overlay services what we formerly referred to as exposure management. This was our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive net flows and a solid beginning to what we expect will be our 25th consecutive year of positive net flows. Our first quarter net inflows equate to 5% annualized internal growth in managed assets as calculated both with and without Parametric overlay services. Looking at our flow results on a revenue basis. In the first quarter, we achieved 5% annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue, which compares to minus 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Although revenue-based internal growth rates are not widely reported by other public asset managers, we continue to believe that Eaton Vance ranks among the investment industry leaders by this key growth measure. As we assess the performance of our business in the first quarter, achieving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth is certainly among the highlights. By this measure, the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was our best growth period since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Last June, we announced an important strategic initiative involving our Parametric Eaton Vance Management and Eaton Vance Distributors affiliates. As we described at that time the initiative has three principal components; rebranding EVM's rules-based systematic investment-grade fixed-income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with this revised rebranding; internally -- integrating under Eaton Vance Distributors the sales teams serving Parametric and EVM clients and business partners in the registered investment adviser and multifamily office market; and then third, combining under Parametric the technology and operating platforms supporting the individual separately managed account businesses of Parametric and EVM. I'm pleased to report that the internal change process supporting this initiative is substantially complete and that we are already starting to see real benefits to our business. Combining our systemic -- systematic equity and investment-grade fixed-income strategies within the same investment affiliate and consolidating our separate account technology and operating platforms positions Parametric and Eaton Vance to build upon our market-leading positions in custom indexing and laddered bond separate accounts as market demand for these strategies continues to surge. As you can see in our press release and accompanying call slides, we have made certain changes in how we categorize our managed assets and flows for reporting purposes. The new Parametric Custom Portfolios reporting category consists of individual and institutional separate accounts managed by Parametric for which customization is a primary feature. The new classification includes the Parametric equity and multi-asset strategies that formerly composed our old portfolio implementation reporting category which are primarily Custom Core and centralized portfolio management as well as the laddered bond separate accounts that were formerly managed by Eaton Vance Management and previously categorized as fixed income for reporting purposes. In the press release and call slides, the presentation of managed assets flows for all prior periods has been revised to reflect the new classifications. As noted earlier, we have already -- we have also changed the name of our former exposure management reporting category to Parametric overlay services. This reporting category consists primarily of futures-based overlay strategies and services offered to institutional clients to enable them to efficiently add or remove market exposure without affecting underlying portfolio holdings. While this is our lowest fee business with an average current fee rate of 4.9 basis points, it is also nicely profitable and growing. Since entering the business through the acquisition of the former Clifton Group in December 2012, our managed assets and overlay services have more than tripled growing from $32 billion at acquisition to a record $97.5 billion at the end of January. Looking at our first quarter flows in more detail. We had positive net flows for all of our mandate reporting categories except floating-rate income. Annualized internal growth in managed assets range from a high of 9% for Parametric custom portfolios, to 7% for fixed income, 5% for equity and Parametric overlay services, and 4% for alternatives. Although, our floating-rate income business saw $1.4 billion in net outflows and minus 15% annualized internal growth in AUM in the first quarter that's a significant improvement from $2.9 billion of net outflows, and minus 26% annualized internal AUM growth in the first quarter of 2019, and $2.6 billion of net outflows, and minus 27% annualized internal AUM growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. The abating of outflow pressures has been especially pronounced in our floating-rate U.S. mutual funds, where net outflows fell from $2.1 billion in last year's first quarter and $1.9 billion in last year's fourth quarter to approximately $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Through Monday of this week, month-to-date outflows from our floating-rate mutual funds had slowed to barely a trickle. Although, net inflows into our alternative strategy were less than $100 million in the first quarter, here too we have experienced substantially improved flow trends compared to fiscal 2019 when we saw net outflows of $2.2 billion in the first quarter and approximately $550 million in the fourth quarter. Our managed assets and flows in the alternative category are dominated by the two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds we offer in the U.S. As a reminder, these funds hold long and short positions in currency and short-duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries. After a disappointing performance in 2018, our global macro funds roared back to strong performance in 2019, no doubt contributing to the improved flow results and flows outlook for the category. February month-to-date flows remain modestly positive for both our global macro mutual funds and the alternative category as a whole. As mentioned earlier, annualized internal growth in our equity mandates was 5% in the first quarter. Calvert EVM and Atlanta Capital each made significant contributions to the quarter's $1.6 billion of equity net inflows. Calvert equity strategies contributed nearly $900 million with the Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert Equity U.S. mutual funds each generating over $250 million of net inflows. EVM equity strategies contributed approximately $850 million to first quarter net inflows, driven primarily by privately offered funds in the U.S. On top of the more than $250 million net inflows into the Atlanta Capital sub-advised Calvert Equity Fund, Atlanta Capital contributed approximately $450 million of equity net inflows in core and growth mandates. In the first quarter, our fixed-income strategies had $1.1 billion of net inflows, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. On a combined basis EVM and Parametric municipal bond strategies contributed over $700 million to quarterly net inflows and EVM, Calvert and Atlanta Capital taxable bond strategies contributed approximately $400 million. Flow leaders across our fixed-income mutual fund lineup, included Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund with nearly $200 million of net inflows and Calvert Short Duration Income Fund, Eaton Vance Core Plus Bond Fund and Eaton Vance National Municipal Income Fund each with over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. The newly constituted Parametric custom portfolios reporting category had net inflows of $3.5 billion in the first quarter, generating 9% annualized internal growth in managed assets. This reflects net contributions of $2.7 billion to custom core equity separate accounts and $1.4 billion into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates, partially offset by approximately $575 million of net withdrawals from centralized portfolio management mandates. Sorted by client type, Parametric custom individual separate accounts had $43 billion of net inflows and Parametric custom institutional separate accounts had $800 million of net outflows. Focusing on custom core equity and laddered bond individual separate accounts the quarter's $4.3 billion of net inflows equates to 15% annualized internal growth in managed assets. As shown on slide 12, Parametric custom portfolios reached a record $175 billion in managed assets as of January 31, 2020. This is a high-growth, highly differentiated investment management business in which Parametric is far and away the market leader across all key segments. We are investing to grow this business by expanding our product offerings, extending our service capability and achieving greater operating efficiencies to drive down costs. We continue to believe that Parametric custom portfolios business is only scratching the surface of its long-term potential. Turning to Calvert. We continue to be very pleased with the business results and investment success we are achieving. In the recently completed first quarter, Calvert generated net inflows of $1.3 billion, which equates to 26% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Including the Calvert Equity Fund sub-advised by Atlanta Capital, Calvert's managed assets reached a new high of $21.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with continued strong investment performance across Calvert's diversified lineup of equity income and multi-asset strategies. As of the end of January, 21 Calvert U.S. mutual funds were rated four or five stars from Morningstar for at least one class of shares including seven five-star rated funds. We continue to see strong demand for Calvert's distinctive lineup of investment strategies that combine a record of investment excellence and a deep multi-decade-long commitment to the principles of responsible investing. As the investment management industry as a whole continues to struggle to grow revenues net of market effects, Eaton Vance's ability to deliver internally sourced, top line growth sets us apart. The strength of our high-growth franchises and customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing and wealth management strategies and services, the range of active strategies that with top-tier performance that we offer across investment asset classes and the prospects for continued recovery in our floating-rate income and alternatives category flows combine to give us confidence that we can continue to grow our business at rates well above the overall asset management industry average. While market action over recent days reminds us that unforeseen forces can upset even the best-laid plans, we approach the balance of 2020, and our long-term future with optimism for continued growth and success. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie.\nLaurie Hylton: Thank you, and good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86 for the first quarter fiscal 2020, up 18% from $0.73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and down 9% from $0.95 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter, includes $0.03 of combined contribution from seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments, compared to a negative $0.02 contribution in the first quarter of last year, and an $0.08 contribution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As you can see in Attachment two to our press release, earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards during those periods of $4.9 million, $2.9 million and $1.5 million respectively. Operating income increased by 11% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 from the same period a year ago, reflecting an 11% increase in both revenue and operating expenses. Operating income was down 1% sequentially, reflecting a 4% increase in revenue and a 7% growth in operating expenses. Our operating margin was 29.8% in both the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets reached a new quarter-end high of $518.2 billion at January 31, 2020, up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets this quarter were up 17% from the same period last year, driving management fee revenue growth of 13%. Management fee revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 32 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Changes in our average annualized management fee rates over the comparative period, primarily reflects shifts in business mix. Sequentially, growth in average managed assets of 4%, matched growth in management fee revenue as our average annualized management fee rate of 30.8 basis points was unchanged. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.2 million to revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus negative $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to expenses. Compensation costs increased 12% year-over-year, reflecting higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and year-end merit adjustments, higher stock-based compensation and higher performance-based and operating income-based bonus accruals, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation. Stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included approximately $5.5 million of accelerated expense recognized in connection with employee retirements. Sequentially, compensation expense increased 7% reflecting higher salaries and benefits driven by increases in headcount, seasonal compensation effects, higher stock-based compensation driven by employee retirements, and higher operating income-based bonus accruals, all partially offset by a decrease in severance costs. First quarter seasonal compensation pressures traditionally include the impact of payroll tax clock resets, the timing of our 401(k) funding and year-end base salary increases. The majority of these seasonal compensation pressures will continue into the second fiscal quarter, before we see relief in the third. That said, we would not expect to see a recurrence of the roughly $5.5 million of stock-based compensation associated with first quarter retirement in the second quarter. In addition, we would anticipate seeing an incremental $1 million to $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation in the second quarter as the impact of divesting of stock-based compensation under our phantom equity plan for outside directors and the recognition of expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan tend to be heavily weighted to the first quarter of each fiscal year. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, increased 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotion costs; higher upfront sales commissions, due to increased sales of closed-end funds, private funds and Class A mutual fund shares; and higher service fee expenses for Class A, and private funds driven by higher average managed assets in those funds. The year-over-year increase further reflects higher private fund commission amortization, partially offset by lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses. Fund-related expenses increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of sub-advised funds. Fund-related expenses were flat sequentially, reflecting an increase in sub-advisory fees paid offset by a decrease in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 11% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services and travel expenses partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Other operating expenses increased by 9% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services, travel expenses and charitable contributions. The increase in other expenses reflects investments we are making to support our strategic initiatives as well as the overall growth of our business. We continue to focus on expense management and identifying ways to gain greater operating leverage. Net gains and other investment income related to seed capital investments contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were negligible in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings, we take into consideration, our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Non-operating income and expense also includes net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This compares to net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and net income from consolidated CLO entities of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The sequential decrease in contribution from consolidated CLO entities primarily reflects the sale of our subordinated interest in a CLO entity during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which resulted in the deconsolidation of that entity. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLO entities reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the current quarter and $0.02 in the first quarter of last year and contributed $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLOs reflect changes in our economic interest in these entities, including the fair market value of our investment distributions received and management fees earned. Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV capital to support growth of this business, then taking advantage of opportunities to exit our CLO position as market conditions allow, generating cash to help fund new CLOs for other -- or for other corporate purposes. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 23.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 22.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The company's income tax rate was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling 3.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 2.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in Attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removed the net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 25.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 23.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.5% and 27%. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we used $45.5 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.4 million shares of our nonvoting common stock for approximately $66.6 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 114.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down 1% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases and excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of employee stock option partially offset by an increase in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%. We finished our first fiscal quarter holding $824.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $315.9 million in seed capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind as we contemplate both volatile markets and significant corporate initiatives. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth, while returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thank. Yes can you clarify -- I think you -- Tom you discussed some of the quarter-to-date flows for certain segments, but left out I think fixed income and equities and some of the other metrics. So maybe just given that you did mention bank loans and alternatives I guess give us a kind of a broader update on the rest of the business.\nTom Faust: Yes. Just to clarify the only thing I talked about was our mutual fund flows for the period just continuing the context of improvement. I'm not really prepared to talk about our overall flow trends for the quarter-to-date as that may or may not be a good indicator of what the quarter as a whole will be. I will say generally that in the same way that we had strong flows across the -- across our businesses in the fourth quarter we've had good flows for the month-to-date. But it's -- we're only a little over three weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to talk too specifically about anything other than those couple of exceptions I made in my remarks.\nDan Fannon: Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of expenses and margins, I guess if we think about the last 12 months in the growth of both the beta in the market as well as your flows and essentially margins are flat year-over-year, so can you talk about an environment where you actually could see margin expansion? And then on the contrary given what's happened more recently with market how we should think about flexibility if that market tailwind is no longer there for a sustained period.\nLaurie Hylton: Hi. It's Laurie. I think we've talked a little bit about the pressures that we obviously see in the first quarter. It's difficult when we start the new fiscal year because we've got these seasonal pressures that we see each first quarter. And most of them relate specifically to compensation. We did our best to call those out. I would say as we're moving into the second quarter, I did call out specifically on stock-based compensation that we would anticipate seeing some level of relief recognizing that we had some material first quarter retirements that forced us to recognize about $5.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense and we've got some seasonal stuff that happens relating to our employee stock purchase plan and our directors plan that probably will provide us some relief as we move into the second quarter to the tune of about $1 million to $1.5 million. In terms of other operating expenses and the way we're thinking about the year, I think we had been telegraphing fairly clearly that we anticipate we're going to be continuing to make some significant investments in technology. I think that there was some \u2013 a little bit of first quarter noise associated with normal first quarter events and operations associated primarily with things like charitable giving which tend to be front-end loaded for us, the way that we actually interact with United Way. But we would anticipate that if we see a decrease in the charitable giving in the second quarter we are seeing a modest ramp-up in our technology spend. So overall, we're \u2013 we'd like to see margin expansion. We do think that there is opportunity for that. Obviously, the volatility of the last several days has got all of us a little bit cautious about how we're thinking about the next quarter but we would anticipate that there is opportunity. That said, we are taking advantage of the initiatives that we've announced to start to really invest in some of our technology platforms to provide for future long-term growth and we're committed to that. If we anticipate, we have to start making some changes because there's something very disruptive that happens, I'm sure we will address that in the coming quarters. But I think that we all recognize in our business that we are getting pressed from above and pressed from below there. But obviously pressures in terms of fee rates, we've talked about those in \u2013 on numerous calls but there's also pressure in terms of the overall cost structure. And we recognize that things like technology and market data are going to be significant components of our overall cost structure and we're going to have to continue to invest in both. So good markets. I think there is opportunity for market \u2013 I mean, margin expansion. Just if we get a lift from market that's a \u2013 that goes straight to the top line. But we also recognize we've got to continue to invest to actually grow the company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. On the custom portfolios, Tom you indicated that you're only scratching the surface. So maybe where are those large opportunities that you alluded to, say over like the medium term? And what is the strategy here to tap them?\nTom Faust: Okay. Pretty open ended. So just maybe \u2013 just to take a second to talk about what custom portfolios are. What's in that? Three broad categories of things. One is equity portfolios that are managed on a basis that broadly replicates a stock market index but with customization to achieve enhanced tax efficiency, so funded in kind to \u2013 at least in part in kind to minimize upfront tax realization; incorporating tax loss harvesting and gain deferral as part of the strategy; and also customization for ESG and other client-specified characteristics. So one piece is what we used to call Custom Core or still \u2013 it's what we call Custom Core equity under Parametric. So that's one big piece. A second piece is laddered fixed-income separate accounts. This is the business that recently moved over from Eaton Vance Management Parametric. And then the third piece is a Parametric business called centralized portfolio management. That is where Parametric is engaged by a platform that does multi-manager strategies where those strategies or where the model \u2013 where each of the underlying manager's fee is a model for Parametric for implementation on a centralized basis, typically with ongoing tax management as a key part of that. So those are the three key pieces. There's a couple of small odds and ends in addition to that. But when talking about generally where we are with each of those in terms of the comment I made about, we think we've just scratched the surface of this first and talking about what we like to call custom indexing or what the market seems to be calling, primarily direct indexing, so that's \u2013 instead of investing in a index mutual fund or index ETF to achieve an index-like exposure, own a significant representative fraction of the underlying stocks in a separate account with the benefits of customization. If you look at the size of the index ETF business and the index mutual fund business, certainly in the trillions of dollars just in the U.S. and you compare that to our business, which is about I think about $110 billion across both institutional and individual separate accounts, the bulk of that being individual, we're the biggest player where a tiny fraction of the percent of the overall market has invested in index strategies through funds. To me for a taxable investor or someone who's motivated significantly by their own personal values, the ability to achieve better results by owning the underlying holdings approach is being self-evident. If this is a relatively easy case to make that in applications where after-tax returns matter, where responsible investing matters, where particularly if you're funding that in kind or in part in kind for investors in higher tax brackets, we don't know this for a fact but our strong supposition is that there are trillions of dollars invested in mutual fund \u2013 index mutual funds and index ETFs that would be ideal candidates for achieving a very similar market exposure in what we think of as a better vehicle. So number one is thinking about direct indexing as an opportunity. Number two, switching over to the fixed income side. That business which is on the order of for us I think about $40 billion in this category maybe I think between $35 million and $40 million, this traditionally developed as financial advisers who had used the laddered separate accounts for their clients, increasingly saw the benefit of using a third-party manager that brings ongoing credit oversight, that brings institutional-quality trade execution and the other things we offer in that strategy. That business we think has significant growth opportunities as well but we also see the potential for these two businesses to converge that is for direct indexing to move from being what is today an equity concept to being a concept that's embraced not only by equity investors, but also by fixed-income investors and also the potential to combine equity and fixed income together in multi-asset solutions. So you can imagine a multi-asset target date or multi-asset target risk kinds of portfolios or custom LDI lots of different ways you can think about putting equity and income strategies together in customized individual separate accounts that are demonstrably value-added versus either fund products that are available in the marketplace or perhaps more fully bespoke that is non-automated approaches that are -- that may be used by financial advisers today to achieve similar underlying exposures. No doubt there will be growing competition in this market. No doubt in places we'll see price competition. But we see strong momentum across these markets. As I mentioned, if you isolate the laddered bond individual separate accounts and the Custom Core equity individual separate accounts the quarter's organic growth rate was about 15%. So we're still growing pretty nicely in that business off of a relatively large base. The third piece of this business which has been kind of stagnant of late what we referred to as centralized portfolio management I also think has significant long-term growth potential. That's about a $30 billion business within I think roughly $175 billion of our Parametric Custom Portfolio business. Again, this is Parametric implementing multi-manager separate accounts on a consolidated basis where we act essentially as the implementation specialist for that manager. Growth opportunities here also are not hard to imagine as efficiency of execution as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve better tax results and as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve desired ESG exposures those are not concepts that only apply to passive portfolios and you can certainly imagine a world where that business also sees accelerated growth. Today, we're not really growing much in that business. But we think it has potential also to be a driver for us within this category of Parametric Custom Portfolios. So I hope that's helpful, Ken?\nKen Worthington: Yes. That was pretty comprehensive. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. \nMike Carrier: Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. So overall another quarter strong diversified flows. It looks like just the one area a little lighter was on the institutional side. So just more curious what drove it if there was any rebalancing? And any color in terms of the pipeline?\nTom Faust: The institutional pipeline overall is quite good. We've had -- we have I guess three multimillion dollar -- multi-hundred million dollar pieces of institutional business that we're expecting in the second quarter that gives us certainly confidence in -- and general momentum in our institutional business. And I'm separating out the exposure management business, which is in our institutional flows, but we show those separately. So in -- think about my comments in institutional separate from exposure management. One of the things that has been working against us and worked against us in this quarter we have a large institutional client in bank loans I think which over the last several quarters has been drawing down their position over time. This was a -- this was and is a multibillion dollar client. So there will be some pressure there. We're most of the way through that drawdown. But this is a long-term allocation that over the last maybe four or five quarters has seen a fairly significant drag on both our bank loan business looking at it from a mandate point of view, but also from our institutional separate account business. Not to double-count those, but we report both of those things. So we're -- we think we're getting near the end of that on a -- more broadly we expect good flows in institutional. Some of the thing -- places where we're achieving institutional success one is our emerging market local income strategy, which is a big quite a big asset class outside the United States where we are seeing some success growing that with institutional clients. Also under the Calvert banner, we recently landed a significant institutional fixed income core fixed-income mandate. And also in the offing is a large high-yield bond individual -- institutional separate account offering that we expect to fund in the current quarter. So I would say overall maybe a mixed bag with one fairly significant negative. That's this bank loan client that's been pulling down over time their exposure to us and other managers that they've hired in this category offset by pretty broad strength in other things. Maybe on the equity side just a comment. You probably have noticed that Atlanta Capital has had a quite strong performance over recent years very strong 2019 numbers. And they also have seen a pickup in their institutional business. And that's what you can think of as traditional large-cap U.S. business, which has been as everyone knows a very tough place to grow institutionally. But their -- the distinctiveness of their performance record and their investment approach has allowed them to grow over the last few quarters and have a decent growth pipeline even in an industry environment where very few people are growing actively managed large-cap U.S. equity mandates.\nMike Carrier: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open. \nJeff Drezner: Hi. Good morning. This is Jeff Drezner on for Rob Lee. Just a quick question. I know you touched on the compensation line. I just wanted to circle back to that for a second just to make sure I caught everything. So there was a $5.5 million expense and then a decrease of about $1 million to $1.5 million that we should not expect to occur again in fiscal Q2, is that correct? Is it -- was there anything else there that I had -- that I missed? I just want to make sure.\nLaurie Hylton: No. Hi, it's Laurie again. No. Actually what I said was that there was $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense this quarter associated with retirements that would not recur in the second quarter. And then there was approximately $1 million to $1.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense that is in the first quarter that will not repeat in the second quarter. So I would just say -- I think what we're saying is effectively that stock-based compensation expense is likely to go down between $6 million and $6.5 million in the second quarter.\nTom Faust: Yeah. So just to add the two numbers up -- add the two numbers up not to subtract one from the other to get the expectation for second quarter versus first quarter.\nLaurie Hylton: Correct.\nJeff Drezner: Got it. Yeah. I appreciate that. And then a quick question on institutional business. And if you can get -- give some color around some ESG strategies at Calvert and how you see that playing out?\nTom Faust: So Calvert's the -- we acquired Calvert at the end of 2016. At that time very close to 100% of their business was U.S. mutual funds and we've grown that business. We've just about doubled Calvert business. We're not quite there but just about doubled Calvert's business from I think $11.9 billion at the end of 2016 when we acquired Calvert. So that business to date -- the business growth has to date still been primarily mutual funds, mutual funds in the U.S. But our ambitions for Calvert and Calvert strategies and the Calvert brand are certainly much broader than U.S. mutual funds. We're implementing a variety of Calvert strategies as institutional separate accounts in conjunction with Parametric as an offering under our Parametric Custom Portfolios banner. So these are both Calvert indexes as implemented by Parametric also the opportunity to offer Calvert active strategies as implemented by a Parametric. Institutionally, as I mentioned we recently had a significant win with a U.S. pension plan that is -- that was attracted to Calvert based on both the strength of their investment performance capability, but also on the strength of their commitment and support of responsible investing. There are many, many, many mission-driven organizations around the U.S. and internationally that we think there's an excellent potential fit between their desire to achieve both strong investment returns, but also alignment of their portfolio holdings with the mission of that organization. So think about all kinds of mission-driven non-profits as well as pension funds and broader organization endowments where responsible investing is a key initiative and a key focus of those organizations. So not to overplay the term, but again we think we're just watching the surface in terms of our ability to take the Calvert brand from heritage as a U.S. mutual fund provider to making that broadly known and broadly represented not only in mutual funds in the U.S. but also funds outside the United States and individual separate accounts and institutional separate accounts in the U.S. and internationally. Clearly this is a time when Calvert is in many respects ideally positioned to grow with surging interest in the market, in the general category of responsible investing. A lot of confusion about what that is and what that means that Calvert based on its long history there can help educate the market on and all that backed by really quite an exceptional investment performance record across a wide range of strategies. So I mentioned that Calvert had 26% organic growth rate in the first quarter. We're certainly optimistic that we can continue to grow Calvert at a well-above average rate not only drawing upon mutual fund clients, but increasingly separate account clients in both institutional and individual markets.\nJeff Drezner: Great. I appreciate the color on that. If I could just get one quick follow-up just on custom beta products. And just any competition you're seeing there? And maybe competition on price or whatnot?\nTom Faust: So when -- in Parametric custom portfolios there is competition. We will -- and growing competition. There's also a growing opportunity. And so we'll see how that plays out. We think there is a much bigger market opportunity for us and other competitors. It's not surprising given the growth profile of this business that there are other people that are trying this. We think there are significant advantages of scale, significant advantages of experience that we have that new market entrants do not have. But we don't expect this to be a one-player market. There are a handful of other significant players and a few around the edges that are maybe dabbling with this. I don't think there's room for a lot of dabblers to achieve success, but there will be likely a handful of market leaders in this business, of which we would expect Parametric to continue to be the largest among those market leaders as we are today. Price is and always has been one element of the competition in the customized individual separate account business. Mostly it's been about features and service and to some degree also access. Can you get in front of the financial adviser? Can you get access to that adviser? Can you articulate the advantages of a customized individual separate account better than the other guys? Can you demonstrate that you're achieving those advantages better than the other guys? And also, importantly, can you service that relationship better than the competition? And service here is both as-needed high-touch service, but also ideally an element of -- an increasing element of low-touch service, that is using technology to drive enhanced service, which we think is going to be critical to maintaining profitability in this business, if prices on average continue to fall, which we expect, by and large, they will over time in this business. On the fixed-income side, it's a bit of a different story. There are several competitors in the laddered bond space. It doesn't feel like the price competition there is intensified. We worry a bit about equal market access in that market relative to broker-dealers offering in-house strategies that can compete against third-party strategies. Also as I mentioned in my earlier comments in response to Ken's question, we do think there's a significant emerging opportunity for fixed income, direct indexing best solutions that we think we're in a far better position to offer those today, than literally anyone else in the marketplace, based on the development work we've done on those kinds of strategies, which we're pretty excited about the potential for long term, to expand how people think about this category. It's not just replicating or roughly replicating an equity index. It's taking that, combining it with fixed income and over time developing solutions that move well beyond replication or tracking of a benchmark, to helping clients and financial advisers meet their financial needs more broadly, including concepts of target risk and target date and custom LDI.\nJeff Drezner: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the color. Maybe just two questions. Tom, maybe start with you. Just big picture down, there's been a fair amount of M&A in the landscape, both on the sort of manufacturing side as well as on the distribution side and in varying forms. What if any impact, do you think, that has in your business?\nTom Faust: Okay. Well, I guess, I'll start with time will tell. We don't know -- most of the acquisitions that have been announced haven't been completed. So, the ones that I think we feel most comfortable, we know the answer to, are consolidation within the asset management industry. And how that usually plays out may not play out in the case of the recently announced transaction. But how that usually plays out is that, during a fairly prolonged transition period, there's some amount of migration of assets from the two companies that are merging two competitors. Strategies get put on hold, there are changes, disruptions to investment teams. Those are the kinds of things that the firms that are merging are trying to minimize and those are the things that their competitors are trying to take advantage of and those are the things that their customers and gatekeepers are watching for and very concerned that there may be negative fallout of this transaction from the point of view of them and their clients. So there's always some opportunity. How big that is, is always very hard to gauge. But, in general, consolidation among competitors in the short run creates opportunity for those competitors, just because of the disruption associated with the merger. Longer term, once the thing happens, it very much depends on their ability to execute and lots of things that are very hard to foresee during the period when acquisitions are being announced. In terms of the more distribution oriented or ones affecting wealth management more than asset management, so this would be the Schwab TD Ameritrade or E*TRADE Morgan Stanley that's just to be clear what I'm talking about, those are a little hard to judge. What is important to us is that, we continue to maintain market access. And that is, obviously, critical to our business success. What we have to do to maintain that is demonstrate that we're worth that, that we provide value added relative to what they can do themselves. That's always been true. That continues to be true in our business. With limited exceptions, we sell to financial intermediaries where build versus buy is a decision that they always have. Any one of these firms could decide if they're going to do asset management in-house. How they get there? Who knows. And the record generally of these firms has not been good. These are very different businesses, asset management versus wealth management, and few companies are able to do both well. As I think about industry change, I take comfort in the fact that Eaton Vance, while we're up, I guess, a meaningful company in many respects, with about $0.5 trillion of assets under management, we are in the grand scheme of the asset management business, a pretty small pimple with a tiny market share in the range of 1% or 2%. As you think about the addressable wealth management marketplace and where our $0.5 trillion stands versus the size of that market. I continue to believe that that size is a big -- is a significant advantage for us, allowing us to grow if we execute effectively on our plan, if we're nimble, if we're smart, if we're innovative, if we can deliver for our clients, even as things happen around us that might be viewed as adverse to our overall industry's prospects. If we can be better than most of the rest of the other guys, we can continue to be very successful as a firm. We're not slavishly limited in our growth by the growth prospects of our industry.\nBill Katz: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And Laurie just one for you a little bit of a nasty question, so I apologize in advance. Can you break down a little bit on where you're sort of spending the technology? What kind of time line you talk about here? Is this a multiyear effort? And then just as I think about the ins and outs of flows versus fee rates it sounds like a very good flow story. But also I hear nothing about the competition in lower-fee products. So, how do you sort of see the dynamic between organic growth versus revenue growth notwithstanding this was a very good quarter of itself?\nLaurie Hylton: Yes. Maybe I'll address the technology question first. I think as we think about technology spend, I'm starting to think about this in terms of new normal. I don't think we're necessarily talking about a one-time big bang we're going to replace a big system and then all of a sudden we're going to be able to stop spending on technology. I don't think that's what we're talking about. What we are talking about is a slightly more consistent incremental spend on technology recognizing that a lot of this is in relation to the initiatives that we've recently announced associated with Parametric and Eaton Vance that we're combining technology platforms, we are looking to invest in technology to ultimately increase our efficiency, increase our effectiveness, bring down the cost of what it actually takes to manage separate accounts on an account-by-account basis. So our goal is to continue to make those investments and we will see an increase in our technology spend over a longer term period. But our goal is to ultimately then be able to leverage that to reduce our overall operating expenses in the future. So, this is from our perspective very much a long-term play and a long-term investment. In terms of revenue, I think as we're looking at our effective fee rates and I think if you look at Attachment 10 in our press release, you can see that they're really on a category-by-category basis. We are not seeing a diminution in our effective fee rate by equity fixed-income alternatives et cetera. What we are seeing is just shifts in mix quarter-over-quarter that ultimately impacts the average effective fee rate for the period. So, I know there's a lot of talk about decreases in effective fee rates. We are not necessarily seeing that by mandate, but we are seeing a decrease year-over-year in our average effective fee rate at the top of the house recognizing that that is being driven by mix. But I think what is positive from my perspective is that as you look at the this quarter ending January -- the quarter ending January 31 versus the quarter ending October 31 we saw no decrease in our overall average effective fee rate. So, we feel very, very positive that we have got some level of stability at the mandate level and that we've got every opportunity to see our average -- our organic growth in assets, if you will, to actually see our organic growth in revenue mirror our organic growth in assets going forward if we are able to continue to advance the ball on our active equity strategies where there are higher fees while growing our somewhat more passive strategies where the fees are lower. So, I think that we demonstrated this quarter that we could effectively do that by producing 5% organic growth in assets and 5% organic growth in revenue.\nTom Faust: And maybe I can just jump in with a couple of comments. If you look at our charts accompanying -- the slides accompanying the call, you can see that over the course of fiscal 2019, there was a bit of a disconnect from our in our ability to grow to achieve organic growth in assets versus our ability to achieve organic revenue growth. So, that's comparing slides nine and 11. If you look at the slides, I guess, it's slides 10 and 11. 10 looks at annualized internal growth in consolidated managed assets on a percentage basis and then 11 looks at that same those same numbers just converted into revenues. The real difference -- the driver of the differences in 2019 was primarily the fact that we saw over the course of that year we saw I think roughly $14 billion of net -- no, I think 12 -- sorry $12 billion of net outflows over the year in two relatively high-fee categories; floating-rate income and global macro strategies that dominate our alternative strategies. The best thing that can happen for us in terms of our ability to achieve organic revenue growth in the same range as our organic asset growth is to stop the outflows in those two strategies. We came we got there in alternatives in the first quarter. We think we're getting very close to that happening in bank loans. Our expectation is for the balance of the year subject to markets is that you'll see a much closer alignment between our ability to grow assets and our ability to grow revenues tied to those assets simply because we don't expect that negative which drove that disconnect last year to continue into this year.\nBill Katz: Its all very helpful. Thank you for the detail.\nTom Faust: Maybe its time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our last question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi thanks. Two quick follow-ups on sustainable investing if I could the conversation. One is I'm curious to get your thoughts on the client interest that you noted and are clearly seeing in terms of dedicated product versus just part of the process of ongoing product. And two is how you think passive plays a role ESG investing. It's counterintuitive but there are products they are getting flows. So, curious on how you think passive impacts pricing and flows yes and sustainable--\nTom Faust: Yes. So, we're -- Calvert has a broad-based menu of strategies in the responsible investing space, including both active and passive. We have \u2013 we are growing in active. We're growing in passive. We have good performance in active. We had good performance in passive. That's on the equity side. Fixed income, we really it's \u2013 it's an all-active strategy business. I think there's an element of responsible investing that doesn't really cut quite neatly between active and passive and that's the aspect of engagement. So what are you doing to help drive value creation and help improve performance of the companies in which you invest? And you do that through how you vote your proxies, how you participate if at all and shareholder resolutions and the conversations that you engage either individually or as part of groups with the management to try to get them to achieve better results. Those kinds of activities to some degree can cut across both active and passive strategies. As it's \u2013 as this business is developing, there's still lot of \u2013 this is a pretty fast-moving turf. Lots of confusing terms that out there things that \u2013 I use on-term you use another. What I \u2013 the term I use might mean something different to me than it does to you. It's going to take a while for that to sort out. But one of the things that I think is clear is that the role of engagement is becoming more and more important in differentiating strategy A from strategy B or manager A from manager B. How do they vote their proxies? How do they participate in shareholder resolutions? How do they, if at all engage with management? So that's a second level of performance beyond the normal way that we measure return. The other things that's I think \u2013 I'd say, we're in the early innings of is measuring performance not only in terms of financial results, but also in terms of non-financial results, that is, how does my portfolio compare to an index or some other competitor in terms of tons of ESG, tons of carbon omitted or tons of carbon shaved, lots of different metrics. And again, it's pretty early days, the information is not great. But I think over time as this information develops, we're going to see more and more and better and better reporting on this, so that there's going to be multiple dimensions to how you think about different categories of responsibly invested strategies. Lots of other \u2013 I was just on a ICI call on this topic, yesterday, but lots of efforts ongoing to try and bring some clarity to the categorization of different funds, what do these words mean. But if it was and is, and likely will be for the near-term pretty fluid in terms of the terminology and we certainly support industry efforts to bring a little more consistency to that terminology. But what's driving our growth, we think is pretty clear. It's the combination of strong performance plus very credible thought leadership, discipline and performance in terms of the ESG efforts that back our investment teams. Its research, its engagement, its impact measurement, and all that backed by having done this under the Calvert brand, since the early 1980s. So, credibility as a manager, depth of resources as an ESG manager and the tie to strong-performing teams. We think that's the \u2013 that's a key to success. Active versus passive, we'll see how that plays out. We tend to think that this is a place where there's greater opportunity for active managers to add value. But as you point out there are also flows going into passive products in this category.\nGlenn Schorr: All right. Thanks so much.\nEric Senay: All right. Well, thank you very much for those of you who participated in today's call and we'll speak with you when we have our next webcast for the second fiscal quarter. Thank you very much and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Faust",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported $0.86 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which is up 18% from $0.73 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and down 9% from $0.95 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On a combined basis seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments contributed $0.03 to adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and negative $0.02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.08 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding these items, first quarter fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share were up 11% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. We ended the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with $518.2 billion of consolidated assets under management which is up 17% from a year ago and up 4% from the previous quarter end. First quarter consolidated net inflows were $6.1 billion or $5 billion excluding what we now call Parametric overlay services what we formerly referred to as exposure management. This was our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive net flows and a solid beginning to what we expect will be our 25th consecutive year of positive net flows. Our first quarter net inflows equate to 5% annualized internal growth in managed assets as calculated both with and without Parametric overlay services. Looking at our flow results on a revenue basis. In the first quarter, we achieved 5% annualized internal growth in consolidated management fee revenue, which compares to minus 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive 2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Although revenue-based internal growth rates are not widely reported by other public asset managers, we continue to believe that Eaton Vance ranks among the investment industry leaders by this key growth measure. As we assess the performance of our business in the first quarter, achieving mid-single-digit organic revenue growth is certainly among the highlights. By this measure, the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was our best growth period since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Last June, we announced an important strategic initiative involving our Parametric Eaton Vance Management and Eaton Vance Distributors affiliates. As we described at that time the initiative has three principal components; rebranding EVM's rules-based systematic investment-grade fixed-income strategies as Parametric and aligning internal reporting consistent with this revised rebranding; internally -- integrating under Eaton Vance Distributors the sales teams serving Parametric and EVM clients and business partners in the registered investment adviser and multifamily office market; and then third, combining under Parametric the technology and operating platforms supporting the individual separately managed account businesses of Parametric and EVM. I'm pleased to report that the internal change process supporting this initiative is substantially complete and that we are already starting to see real benefits to our business. Combining our systemic -- systematic equity and investment-grade fixed-income strategies within the same investment affiliate and consolidating our separate account technology and operating platforms positions Parametric and Eaton Vance to build upon our market-leading positions in custom indexing and laddered bond separate accounts as market demand for these strategies continues to surge. As you can see in our press release and accompanying call slides, we have made certain changes in how we categorize our managed assets and flows for reporting purposes. The new Parametric Custom Portfolios reporting category consists of individual and institutional separate accounts managed by Parametric for which customization is a primary feature. The new classification includes the Parametric equity and multi-asset strategies that formerly composed our old portfolio implementation reporting category which are primarily Custom Core and centralized portfolio management as well as the laddered bond separate accounts that were formerly managed by Eaton Vance Management and previously categorized as fixed income for reporting purposes. In the press release and call slides, the presentation of managed assets flows for all prior periods has been revised to reflect the new classifications. As noted earlier, we have already -- we have also changed the name of our former exposure management reporting category to Parametric overlay services. This reporting category consists primarily of futures-based overlay strategies and services offered to institutional clients to enable them to efficiently add or remove market exposure without affecting underlying portfolio holdings. While this is our lowest fee business with an average current fee rate of 4.9 basis points, it is also nicely profitable and growing. Since entering the business through the acquisition of the former Clifton Group in December 2012, our managed assets and overlay services have more than tripled growing from $32 billion at acquisition to a record $97.5 billion at the end of January. Looking at our first quarter flows in more detail. We had positive net flows for all of our mandate reporting categories except floating-rate income. Annualized internal growth in managed assets range from a high of 9% for Parametric custom portfolios, to 7% for fixed income, 5% for equity and Parametric overlay services, and 4% for alternatives. Although, our floating-rate income business saw $1.4 billion in net outflows and minus 15% annualized internal growth in AUM in the first quarter that's a significant improvement from $2.9 billion of net outflows, and minus 26% annualized internal AUM growth in the first quarter of 2019, and $2.6 billion of net outflows, and minus 27% annualized internal AUM growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. The abating of outflow pressures has been especially pronounced in our floating-rate U.S. mutual funds, where net outflows fell from $2.1 billion in last year's first quarter and $1.9 billion in last year's fourth quarter to approximately $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Through Monday of this week, month-to-date outflows from our floating-rate mutual funds had slowed to barely a trickle. Although, net inflows into our alternative strategy were less than $100 million in the first quarter, here too we have experienced substantially improved flow trends compared to fiscal 2019 when we saw net outflows of $2.2 billion in the first quarter and approximately $550 million in the fourth quarter. Our managed assets and flows in the alternative category are dominated by the two Global Macro Absolute Return mutual funds we offer in the U.S. As a reminder, these funds hold long and short positions in currency and short-duration sovereign debt instruments of emerging and frontier market countries. After a disappointing performance in 2018, our global macro funds roared back to strong performance in 2019, no doubt contributing to the improved flow results and flows outlook for the category. February month-to-date flows remain modestly positive for both our global macro mutual funds and the alternative category as a whole. As mentioned earlier, annualized internal growth in our equity mandates was 5% in the first quarter. Calvert EVM and Atlanta Capital each made significant contributions to the quarter's $1.6 billion of equity net inflows. Calvert equity strategies contributed nearly $900 million with the Calvert Emerging Markets and Calvert Equity U.S. mutual funds each generating over $250 million of net inflows. EVM equity strategies contributed approximately $850 million to first quarter net inflows, driven primarily by privately offered funds in the U.S. On top of the more than $250 million net inflows into the Atlanta Capital sub-advised Calvert Equity Fund, Atlanta Capital contributed approximately $450 million of equity net inflows in core and growth mandates. In the first quarter, our fixed-income strategies had $1.1 billion of net inflows, which equates to 7% annualized internal growth in managed assets. On a combined basis EVM and Parametric municipal bond strategies contributed over $700 million to quarterly net inflows and EVM, Calvert and Atlanta Capital taxable bond strategies contributed approximately $400 million. Flow leaders across our fixed-income mutual fund lineup, included Eaton Vance Emerging Markets Local Income Fund with nearly $200 million of net inflows and Calvert Short Duration Income Fund, Eaton Vance Core Plus Bond Fund and Eaton Vance National Municipal Income Fund each with over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter. The newly constituted Parametric custom portfolios reporting category had net inflows of $3.5 billion in the first quarter, generating 9% annualized internal growth in managed assets. This reflects net contributions of $2.7 billion to custom core equity separate accounts and $1.4 billion into laddered bond separate accounts across municipal and corporate mandates, partially offset by approximately $575 million of net withdrawals from centralized portfolio management mandates. Sorted by client type, Parametric custom individual separate accounts had $43 billion of net inflows and Parametric custom institutional separate accounts had $800 million of net outflows. Focusing on custom core equity and laddered bond individual separate accounts the quarter's $4.3 billion of net inflows equates to 15% annualized internal growth in managed assets. As shown on slide 12, Parametric custom portfolios reached a record $175 billion in managed assets as of January 31, 2020. This is a high-growth, highly differentiated investment management business in which Parametric is far and away the market leader across all key segments. We are investing to grow this business by expanding our product offerings, extending our service capability and achieving greater operating efficiencies to drive down costs. We continue to believe that Parametric custom portfolios business is only scratching the surface of its long-term potential. Turning to Calvert. We continue to be very pleased with the business results and investment success we are achieving. In the recently completed first quarter, Calvert generated net inflows of $1.3 billion, which equates to 26% annualized internal growth in managed assets. Including the Calvert Equity Fund sub-advised by Atlanta Capital, Calvert's managed assets reached a new high of $21.8 billion at the end of the first quarter with continued strong investment performance across Calvert's diversified lineup of equity income and multi-asset strategies. As of the end of January, 21 Calvert U.S. mutual funds were rated four or five stars from Morningstar for at least one class of shares including seven five-star rated funds. We continue to see strong demand for Calvert's distinctive lineup of investment strategies that combine a record of investment excellence and a deep multi-decade-long commitment to the principles of responsible investing. As the investment management industry as a whole continues to struggle to grow revenues net of market effects, Eaton Vance's ability to deliver internally sourced, top line growth sets us apart. The strength of our high-growth franchises and customized individual separate accounts, responsible investing and wealth management strategies and services, the range of active strategies that with top-tier performance that we offer across investment asset classes and the prospects for continued recovery in our floating-rate income and alternatives category flows combine to give us confidence that we can continue to grow our business at rates well above the overall asset management industry average. While market action over recent days reminds us that unforeseen forces can upset even the best-laid plans, we approach the balance of 2020, and our long-term future with optimism for continued growth and success. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Laurie. Yes. Just to clarify the only thing I talked about was our mutual fund flows for the period just continuing the context of improvement. I'm not really prepared to talk about our overall flow trends for the quarter-to-date as that may or may not be a good indicator of what the quarter as a whole will be. I will say generally that in the same way that we had strong flows across the -- across our businesses in the fourth quarter we've had good flows for the month-to-date. But it's -- we're only a little over three weeks into the quarter, so I don't want to talk too specifically about anything other than those couple of exceptions I made in my remarks. Okay. Pretty open ended. So just maybe \u2013 just to take a second to talk about what custom portfolios are. What's in that? Three broad categories of things. One is equity portfolios that are managed on a basis that broadly replicates a stock market index but with customization to achieve enhanced tax efficiency, so funded in kind to \u2013 at least in part in kind to minimize upfront tax realization; incorporating tax loss harvesting and gain deferral as part of the strategy; and also customization for ESG and other client-specified characteristics. So one piece is what we used to call Custom Core or still \u2013 it's what we call Custom Core equity under Parametric. So that's one big piece. A second piece is laddered fixed-income separate accounts. This is the business that recently moved over from Eaton Vance Management Parametric. And then the third piece is a Parametric business called centralized portfolio management. That is where Parametric is engaged by a platform that does multi-manager strategies where those strategies or where the model \u2013 where each of the underlying manager's fee is a model for Parametric for implementation on a centralized basis, typically with ongoing tax management as a key part of that. So those are the three key pieces. There's a couple of small odds and ends in addition to that. But when talking about generally where we are with each of those in terms of the comment I made about, we think we've just scratched the surface of this first and talking about what we like to call custom indexing or what the market seems to be calling, primarily direct indexing, so that's \u2013 instead of investing in a index mutual fund or index ETF to achieve an index-like exposure, own a significant representative fraction of the underlying stocks in a separate account with the benefits of customization. If you look at the size of the index ETF business and the index mutual fund business, certainly in the trillions of dollars just in the U.S. and you compare that to our business, which is about I think about $110 billion across both institutional and individual separate accounts, the bulk of that being individual, we're the biggest player where a tiny fraction of the percent of the overall market has invested in index strategies through funds. To me for a taxable investor or someone who's motivated significantly by their own personal values, the ability to achieve better results by owning the underlying holdings approach is being self-evident. If this is a relatively easy case to make that in applications where after-tax returns matter, where responsible investing matters, where particularly if you're funding that in kind or in part in kind for investors in higher tax brackets, we don't know this for a fact but our strong supposition is that there are trillions of dollars invested in mutual fund \u2013 index mutual funds and index ETFs that would be ideal candidates for achieving a very similar market exposure in what we think of as a better vehicle. So number one is thinking about direct indexing as an opportunity. Number two, switching over to the fixed income side. That business which is on the order of for us I think about $40 billion in this category maybe I think between $35 million and $40 million, this traditionally developed as financial advisers who had used the laddered separate accounts for their clients, increasingly saw the benefit of using a third-party manager that brings ongoing credit oversight, that brings institutional-quality trade execution and the other things we offer in that strategy. That business we think has significant growth opportunities as well but we also see the potential for these two businesses to converge that is for direct indexing to move from being what is today an equity concept to being a concept that's embraced not only by equity investors, but also by fixed-income investors and also the potential to combine equity and fixed income together in multi-asset solutions. So you can imagine a multi-asset target date or multi-asset target risk kinds of portfolios or custom LDI lots of different ways you can think about putting equity and income strategies together in customized individual separate accounts that are demonstrably value-added versus either fund products that are available in the marketplace or perhaps more fully bespoke that is non-automated approaches that are -- that may be used by financial advisers today to achieve similar underlying exposures. No doubt there will be growing competition in this market. No doubt in places we'll see price competition. But we see strong momentum across these markets. As I mentioned, if you isolate the laddered bond individual separate accounts and the Custom Core equity individual separate accounts the quarter's organic growth rate was about 15%. So we're still growing pretty nicely in that business off of a relatively large base. The third piece of this business which has been kind of stagnant of late what we referred to as centralized portfolio management I also think has significant long-term growth potential. That's about a $30 billion business within I think roughly $175 billion of our Parametric Custom Portfolio business. Again, this is Parametric implementing multi-manager separate accounts on a consolidated basis where we act essentially as the implementation specialist for that manager. Growth opportunities here also are not hard to imagine as efficiency of execution as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve better tax results and as the ability to tilt portfolios to achieve desired ESG exposures those are not concepts that only apply to passive portfolios and you can certainly imagine a world where that business also sees accelerated growth. Today, we're not really growing much in that business. But we think it has potential also to be a driver for us within this category of Parametric Custom Portfolios. So I hope that's helpful, Ken? The institutional pipeline overall is quite good. We've had -- we have I guess three multimillion dollar -- multi-hundred million dollar pieces of institutional business that we're expecting in the second quarter that gives us certainly confidence in -- and general momentum in our institutional business. And I'm separating out the exposure management business, which is in our institutional flows, but we show those separately. So in -- think about my comments in institutional separate from exposure management. One of the things that has been working against us and worked against us in this quarter we have a large institutional client in bank loans I think which over the last several quarters has been drawing down their position over time. This was a -- this was and is a multibillion dollar client. So there will be some pressure there. We're most of the way through that drawdown. But this is a long-term allocation that over the last maybe four or five quarters has seen a fairly significant drag on both our bank loan business looking at it from a mandate point of view, but also from our institutional separate account business. Not to double-count those, but we report both of those things. So we're -- we think we're getting near the end of that on a -- more broadly we expect good flows in institutional. Some of the thing -- places where we're achieving institutional success one is our emerging market local income strategy, which is a big quite a big asset class outside the United States where we are seeing some success growing that with institutional clients. Also under the Calvert banner, we recently landed a significant institutional fixed income core fixed-income mandate. And also in the offing is a large high-yield bond individual -- institutional separate account offering that we expect to fund in the current quarter. So I would say overall maybe a mixed bag with one fairly significant negative. That's this bank loan client that's been pulling down over time their exposure to us and other managers that they've hired in this category offset by pretty broad strength in other things. Maybe on the equity side just a comment. You probably have noticed that Atlanta Capital has had a quite strong performance over recent years very strong 2019 numbers. And they also have seen a pickup in their institutional business. And that's what you can think of as traditional large-cap U.S. business, which has been as everyone knows a very tough place to grow institutionally. But their -- the distinctiveness of their performance record and their investment approach has allowed them to grow over the last few quarters and have a decent growth pipeline even in an industry environment where very few people are growing actively managed large-cap U.S. equity mandates. Yeah. So just to add the two numbers up -- add the two numbers up not to subtract one from the other to get the expectation for second quarter versus first quarter. So Calvert's the -- we acquired Calvert at the end of 2016. At that time very close to 100% of their business was U.S. mutual funds and we've grown that business. We've just about doubled Calvert business. We're not quite there but just about doubled Calvert's business from I think $11.9 billion at the end of 2016 when we acquired Calvert. So that business to date -- the business growth has to date still been primarily mutual funds, mutual funds in the U.S. But our ambitions for Calvert and Calvert strategies and the Calvert brand are certainly much broader than U.S. mutual funds. We're implementing a variety of Calvert strategies as institutional separate accounts in conjunction with Parametric as an offering under our Parametric Custom Portfolios banner. So these are both Calvert indexes as implemented by Parametric also the opportunity to offer Calvert active strategies as implemented by a Parametric. Institutionally, as I mentioned we recently had a significant win with a U.S. pension plan that is -- that was attracted to Calvert based on both the strength of their investment performance capability, but also on the strength of their commitment and support of responsible investing. There are many, many, many mission-driven organizations around the U.S. and internationally that we think there's an excellent potential fit between their desire to achieve both strong investment returns, but also alignment of their portfolio holdings with the mission of that organization. So think about all kinds of mission-driven non-profits as well as pension funds and broader organization endowments where responsible investing is a key initiative and a key focus of those organizations. So not to overplay the term, but again we think we're just watching the surface in terms of our ability to take the Calvert brand from heritage as a U.S. mutual fund provider to making that broadly known and broadly represented not only in mutual funds in the U.S. but also funds outside the United States and individual separate accounts and institutional separate accounts in the U.S. and internationally. Clearly this is a time when Calvert is in many respects ideally positioned to grow with surging interest in the market, in the general category of responsible investing. A lot of confusion about what that is and what that means that Calvert based on its long history there can help educate the market on and all that backed by really quite an exceptional investment performance record across a wide range of strategies. So I mentioned that Calvert had 26% organic growth rate in the first quarter. We're certainly optimistic that we can continue to grow Calvert at a well-above average rate not only drawing upon mutual fund clients, but increasingly separate account clients in both institutional and individual markets. So when -- in Parametric custom portfolios there is competition. We will -- and growing competition. There's also a growing opportunity. And so we'll see how that plays out. We think there is a much bigger market opportunity for us and other competitors. It's not surprising given the growth profile of this business that there are other people that are trying this. We think there are significant advantages of scale, significant advantages of experience that we have that new market entrants do not have. But we don't expect this to be a one-player market. There are a handful of other significant players and a few around the edges that are maybe dabbling with this. I don't think there's room for a lot of dabblers to achieve success, but there will be likely a handful of market leaders in this business, of which we would expect Parametric to continue to be the largest among those market leaders as we are today. Price is and always has been one element of the competition in the customized individual separate account business. Mostly it's been about features and service and to some degree also access. Can you get in front of the financial adviser? Can you get access to that adviser? Can you articulate the advantages of a customized individual separate account better than the other guys? Can you demonstrate that you're achieving those advantages better than the other guys? And also, importantly, can you service that relationship better than the competition? And service here is both as-needed high-touch service, but also ideally an element of -- an increasing element of low-touch service, that is using technology to drive enhanced service, which we think is going to be critical to maintaining profitability in this business, if prices on average continue to fall, which we expect, by and large, they will over time in this business. On the fixed-income side, it's a bit of a different story. There are several competitors in the laddered bond space. It doesn't feel like the price competition there is intensified. We worry a bit about equal market access in that market relative to broker-dealers offering in-house strategies that can compete against third-party strategies. Also as I mentioned in my earlier comments in response to Ken's question, we do think there's a significant emerging opportunity for fixed income, direct indexing best solutions that we think we're in a far better position to offer those today, than literally anyone else in the marketplace, based on the development work we've done on those kinds of strategies, which we're pretty excited about the potential for long term, to expand how people think about this category. It's not just replicating or roughly replicating an equity index. It's taking that, combining it with fixed income and over time developing solutions that move well beyond replication or tracking of a benchmark, to helping clients and financial advisers meet their financial needs more broadly, including concepts of target risk and target date and custom LDI. Okay. Well, I guess, I'll start with time will tell. We don't know -- most of the acquisitions that have been announced haven't been completed. So, the ones that I think we feel most comfortable, we know the answer to, are consolidation within the asset management industry. And how that usually plays out may not play out in the case of the recently announced transaction. But how that usually plays out is that, during a fairly prolonged transition period, there's some amount of migration of assets from the two companies that are merging two competitors. Strategies get put on hold, there are changes, disruptions to investment teams. Those are the kinds of things that the firms that are merging are trying to minimize and those are the things that their competitors are trying to take advantage of and those are the things that their customers and gatekeepers are watching for and very concerned that there may be negative fallout of this transaction from the point of view of them and their clients. So there's always some opportunity. How big that is, is always very hard to gauge. But, in general, consolidation among competitors in the short run creates opportunity for those competitors, just because of the disruption associated with the merger. Longer term, once the thing happens, it very much depends on their ability to execute and lots of things that are very hard to foresee during the period when acquisitions are being announced. In terms of the more distribution oriented or ones affecting wealth management more than asset management, so this would be the Schwab TD Ameritrade or E*TRADE Morgan Stanley that's just to be clear what I'm talking about, those are a little hard to judge. What is important to us is that, we continue to maintain market access. And that is, obviously, critical to our business success. What we have to do to maintain that is demonstrate that we're worth that, that we provide value added relative to what they can do themselves. That's always been true. That continues to be true in our business. With limited exceptions, we sell to financial intermediaries where build versus buy is a decision that they always have. Any one of these firms could decide if they're going to do asset management in-house. How they get there? Who knows. And the record generally of these firms has not been good. These are very different businesses, asset management versus wealth management, and few companies are able to do both well. As I think about industry change, I take comfort in the fact that Eaton Vance, while we're up, I guess, a meaningful company in many respects, with about $0.5 trillion of assets under management, we are in the grand scheme of the asset management business, a pretty small pimple with a tiny market share in the range of 1% or 2%. As you think about the addressable wealth management marketplace and where our $0.5 trillion stands versus the size of that market. I continue to believe that that size is a big -- is a significant advantage for us, allowing us to grow if we execute effectively on our plan, if we're nimble, if we're smart, if we're innovative, if we can deliver for our clients, even as things happen around us that might be viewed as adverse to our overall industry's prospects. If we can be better than most of the rest of the other guys, we can continue to be very successful as a firm. We're not slavishly limited in our growth by the growth prospects of our industry. And maybe I can just jump in with a couple of comments. If you look at our charts accompanying -- the slides accompanying the call, you can see that over the course of fiscal 2019, there was a bit of a disconnect from our in our ability to grow to achieve organic growth in assets versus our ability to achieve organic revenue growth. So, that's comparing slides nine and 11. If you look at the slides, I guess, it's slides 10 and 11. 10 looks at annualized internal growth in consolidated managed assets on a percentage basis and then 11 looks at that same those same numbers just converted into revenues. The real difference -- the driver of the differences in 2019 was primarily the fact that we saw over the course of that year we saw I think roughly $14 billion of net -- no, I think 12 -- sorry $12 billion of net outflows over the year in two relatively high-fee categories; floating-rate income and global macro strategies that dominate our alternative strategies. The best thing that can happen for us in terms of our ability to achieve organic revenue growth in the same range as our organic asset growth is to stop the outflows in those two strategies. We came we got there in alternatives in the first quarter. We think we're getting very close to that happening in bank loans. Our expectation is for the balance of the year subject to markets is that you'll see a much closer alignment between our ability to grow assets and our ability to grow revenues tied to those assets simply because we don't expect that negative which drove that disconnect last year to continue into this year. Maybe its time for one more question. Yes. So, we're -- Calvert has a broad-based menu of strategies in the responsible investing space, including both active and passive. We have \u2013 we are growing in active. We're growing in passive. We have good performance in active. We had good performance in passive. That's on the equity side. Fixed income, we really it's \u2013 it's an all-active strategy business. I think there's an element of responsible investing that doesn't really cut quite neatly between active and passive and that's the aspect of engagement. So what are you doing to help drive value creation and help improve performance of the companies in which you invest? And you do that through how you vote your proxies, how you participate if at all and shareholder resolutions and the conversations that you engage either individually or as part of groups with the management to try to get them to achieve better results. Those kinds of activities to some degree can cut across both active and passive strategies. As it's \u2013 as this business is developing, there's still lot of \u2013 this is a pretty fast-moving turf. Lots of confusing terms that out there things that \u2013 I use on-term you use another. What I \u2013 the term I use might mean something different to me than it does to you. It's going to take a while for that to sort out. But one of the things that I think is clear is that the role of engagement is becoming more and more important in differentiating strategy A from strategy B or manager A from manager B. How do they vote their proxies? How do they participate in shareholder resolutions? How do they, if at all engage with management? So that's a second level of performance beyond the normal way that we measure return. The other things that's I think \u2013 I'd say, we're in the early innings of is measuring performance not only in terms of financial results, but also in terms of non-financial results, that is, how does my portfolio compare to an index or some other competitor in terms of tons of ESG, tons of carbon omitted or tons of carbon shaved, lots of different metrics. And again, it's pretty early days, the information is not great. But I think over time as this information develops, we're going to see more and more and better and better reporting on this, so that there's going to be multiple dimensions to how you think about different categories of responsibly invested strategies. Lots of other \u2013 I was just on a ICI call on this topic, yesterday, but lots of efforts ongoing to try and bring some clarity to the categorization of different funds, what do these words mean. But if it was and is, and likely will be for the near-term pretty fluid in terms of the terminology and we certainly support industry efforts to bring a little more consistency to that terminology. But what's driving our growth, we think is pretty clear. It's the combination of strong performance plus very credible thought leadership, discipline and performance in terms of the ESG efforts that back our investment teams. Its research, its engagement, its impact measurement, and all that backed by having done this under the Calvert brand, since the early 1980s. So, credibility as a manager, depth of resources as an ESG manager and the tie to strong-performing teams. We think that's the \u2013 that's a key to success. Active versus passive, we'll see how that plays out. We tend to think that this is a place where there's greater opportunity for active managers to add value. But as you point out there are also flows going into passive products in this category."

            "name": "Laurie Hylton",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. As Tom described, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86 for the first quarter fiscal 2020, up 18% from $0.73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and down 9% from $0.95 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share this quarter, includes $0.03 of combined contribution from seed capital and consolidated CLO entity investments, compared to a negative $0.02 contribution in the first quarter of last year, and an $0.08 contribution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As you can see in Attachment two to our press release, earnings under U.S. GAAP exceeded adjusted earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting the reversal of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards during those periods of $4.9 million, $2.9 million and $1.5 million respectively. Operating income increased by 11% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 from the same period a year ago, reflecting an 11% increase in both revenue and operating expenses. Operating income was down 1% sequentially, reflecting a 4% increase in revenue and a 7% growth in operating expenses. Our operating margin was 29.8% in both the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 31.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As Tom noted, ending consolidated managed assets reached a new quarter-end high of $518.2 billion at January 31, 2020, up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by strong net flows and positive market returns. Average managed assets this quarter were up 17% from the same period last year, driving management fee revenue growth of 13%. Management fee revenue growth trailed growth in average managed assets year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in our average annualized management fee rate from 32 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 30.8 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Changes in our average annualized management fee rates over the comparative period, primarily reflects shifts in business mix. Sequentially, growth in average managed assets of 4%, matched growth in management fee revenue as our average annualized management fee rate of 30.8 basis points was unchanged. Performance-based fees, which are excluded from the calculation of our average management fee rates, contributed $0.2 million to revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus negative $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and positive $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Turning to expenses. Compensation costs increased 12% year-over-year, reflecting higher salaries and benefits associated with increases in headcount and year-end merit adjustments, higher stock-based compensation and higher performance-based and operating income-based bonus accruals, partially offset by lower sales-based incentive compensation. Stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 included approximately $5.5 million of accelerated expense recognized in connection with employee retirements. Sequentially, compensation expense increased 7% reflecting higher salaries and benefits driven by increases in headcount, seasonal compensation effects, higher stock-based compensation driven by employee retirements, and higher operating income-based bonus accruals, all partially offset by a decrease in severance costs. First quarter seasonal compensation pressures traditionally include the impact of payroll tax clock resets, the timing of our 401(k) funding and year-end base salary increases. The majority of these seasonal compensation pressures will continue into the second fiscal quarter, before we see relief in the third. That said, we would not expect to see a recurrence of the roughly $5.5 million of stock-based compensation associated with first quarter retirement in the second quarter. In addition, we would anticipate seeing an incremental $1 million to $1.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation in the second quarter as the impact of divesting of stock-based compensation under our phantom equity plan for outside directors and the recognition of expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan tend to be heavily weighted to the first quarter of each fiscal year. Non-compensation distribution-related costs, including distribution and service fee expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions, increased 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotion costs; higher upfront sales commissions, due to increased sales of closed-end funds, private funds and Class A mutual fund shares; and higher service fee expenses for Class A, and private funds driven by higher average managed assets in those funds. The year-over-year increase further reflects higher private fund commission amortization, partially offset by lower Class C distribution and service fee expenses. Fund-related expenses increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher sub-advisory fees due to an increase in average managed assets of sub-advised funds. Fund-related expenses were flat sequentially, reflecting an increase in sub-advisory fees paid offset by a decrease in fund expenses borne by the company. Other operating expenses increased 11% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services and travel expenses partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Other operating expenses increased by 9% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting increases in information technology spending, market data services, professional services, travel expenses and charitable contributions. The increase in other expenses reflects investments we are making to support our strategic initiatives as well as the overall growth of our business. We continue to focus on expense management and identifying ways to gain greater operating leverage. Net gains and other investment income related to seed capital investments contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were negligible in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and contributed $0.04 to earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. When quantifying the impact of our seed capital investments on earnings, we take into consideration, our pro rata share of the gains, losses and other investment income earned on investments in sponsored strategies, whether accounted for as consolidated funds, separate accounts or equity investments, as well as the gains and losses recognized on derivatives used to hedge these investments. We then report the per share impact net of income taxes and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We continue to hedge the market exposures of our seed capital portfolio to the extent practicable to minimize the associated earnings volatility. Non-operating income and expense also includes net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This compares to net expenses from consolidated CLO entities of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and net income from consolidated CLO entities of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The sequential decrease in contribution from consolidated CLO entities primarily reflects the sale of our subordinated interest in a CLO entity during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which resulted in the deconsolidation of that entity. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLO entities reduced earnings per diluted share by $0.01 in the current quarter and $0.02 in the first quarter of last year and contributed $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Other income and expense amounts related to consolidated CLOs reflect changes in our economic interest in these entities, including the fair market value of our investment distributions received and management fees earned. Our strategy for CLO equity remains to commit prudent amounts of EV capital to support growth of this business, then taking advantage of opportunities to exit our CLO position as market conditions allow, generating cash to help fund new CLOs for other -- or for other corporate purposes. Turning to taxes. Our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was 22.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 23.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 22.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The company's income tax rate was reduced by net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards totaling 3.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 2.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As shown in Attachment two to our press release, our calculations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share removed the net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. On this basis our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 25.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 23.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On the same adjusted basis, we estimate that our quarterly effective tax rate for the balance of fiscal 2020 and for the fiscal year as a whole will range between 26.5% and 27%. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we used $45.5 million of corporate cash to pay the $0.375 per share quarterly dividend we declared at the end of our previous quarter and repurchased 1.4 million shares of our nonvoting common stock for approximately $66.6 million. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 114.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down 1% year-over-year, reflecting share repurchases and excess of new shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of employee stock option partially offset by an increase in the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and unvested restricted stock awards. Sequentially weighted average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%. We finished our first fiscal quarter holding $824.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt securities and approximately $315.9 million in seed capital investments. We continue to place high priority on using the company's cash flow to benefit shareholders. Fiscal discipline around discretionary spending remains top of mind as we contemplate both volatile markets and significant corporate initiatives. Based on our strong liquidity and overall financial condition, we believe we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth, while returning capital to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments. At this point, we'd like to take any questions you may have. Hi. It's Laurie. I think we've talked a little bit about the pressures that we obviously see in the first quarter. It's difficult when we start the new fiscal year because we've got these seasonal pressures that we see each first quarter. And most of them relate specifically to compensation. We did our best to call those out. I would say as we're moving into the second quarter, I did call out specifically on stock-based compensation that we would anticipate seeing some level of relief recognizing that we had some material first quarter retirements that forced us to recognize about $5.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense and we've got some seasonal stuff that happens relating to our employee stock purchase plan and our directors plan that probably will provide us some relief as we move into the second quarter to the tune of about $1 million to $1.5 million. In terms of other operating expenses and the way we're thinking about the year, I think we had been telegraphing fairly clearly that we anticipate we're going to be continuing to make some significant investments in technology. I think that there was some \u2013 a little bit of first quarter noise associated with normal first quarter events and operations associated primarily with things like charitable giving which tend to be front-end loaded for us, the way that we actually interact with United Way. But we would anticipate that if we see a decrease in the charitable giving in the second quarter we are seeing a modest ramp-up in our technology spend. So overall, we're \u2013 we'd like to see margin expansion. We do think that there is opportunity for that. Obviously, the volatility of the last several days has got all of us a little bit cautious about how we're thinking about the next quarter but we would anticipate that there is opportunity. That said, we are taking advantage of the initiatives that we've announced to start to really invest in some of our technology platforms to provide for future long-term growth and we're committed to that. If we anticipate, we have to start making some changes because there's something very disruptive that happens, I'm sure we will address that in the coming quarters. But I think that we all recognize in our business that we are getting pressed from above and pressed from below there. But obviously pressures in terms of fee rates, we've talked about those in \u2013 on numerous calls but there's also pressure in terms of the overall cost structure. And we recognize that things like technology and market data are going to be significant components of our overall cost structure and we're going to have to continue to invest in both. So good markets. I think there is opportunity for market \u2013 I mean, margin expansion. Just if we get a lift from market that's a \u2013 that goes straight to the top line. But we also recognize we've got to continue to invest to actually grow the company. No. Hi, it's Laurie again. No. Actually what I said was that there was $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense this quarter associated with retirements that would not recur in the second quarter. And then there was approximately $1 million to $1.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense that is in the first quarter that will not repeat in the second quarter. So I would just say -- I think what we're saying is effectively that stock-based compensation expense is likely to go down between $6 million and $6.5 million in the second quarter. Correct. Yes. Maybe I'll address the technology question first. I think as we think about technology spend, I'm starting to think about this in terms of new normal. I don't think we're necessarily talking about a one-time big bang we're going to replace a big system and then all of a sudden we're going to be able to stop spending on technology. I don't think that's what we're talking about. What we are talking about is a slightly more consistent incremental spend on technology recognizing that a lot of this is in relation to the initiatives that we've recently announced associated with Parametric and Eaton Vance that we're combining technology platforms, we are looking to invest in technology to ultimately increase our efficiency, increase our effectiveness, bring down the cost of what it actually takes to manage separate accounts on an account-by-account basis. So our goal is to continue to make those investments and we will see an increase in our technology spend over a longer term period. But our goal is to ultimately then be able to leverage that to reduce our overall operating expenses in the future. So, this is from our perspective very much a long-term play and a long-term investment. In terms of revenue, I think as we're looking at our effective fee rates and I think if you look at Attachment 10 in our press release, you can see that they're really on a category-by-category basis. We are not seeing a diminution in our effective fee rate by equity fixed-income alternatives et cetera. What we are seeing is just shifts in mix quarter-over-quarter that ultimately impacts the average effective fee rate for the period. So, I know there's a lot of talk about decreases in effective fee rates. We are not necessarily seeing that by mandate, but we are seeing a decrease year-over-year in our average effective fee rate at the top of the house recognizing that that is being driven by mix. But I think what is positive from my perspective is that as you look at the this quarter ending January -- the quarter ending January 31 versus the quarter ending October 31 we saw no decrease in our overall average effective fee rate. So, we feel very, very positive that we have got some level of stability at the mandate level and that we've got every opportunity to see our average -- our organic growth in assets, if you will, to actually see our organic growth in revenue mirror our organic growth in assets going forward if we are able to continue to advance the ball on our active equity strategies where there are higher fees while growing our somewhat more passive strategies where the fees are lower. So, I think that we demonstrated this quarter that we could effectively do that by producing 5% organic growth in assets and 5% organic growth in revenue."

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation of the earnings release. Morgan Stanley closed its acquisition of E*TRADE on October 2, 2020, impacting annual comparisons for the Firm and Wealth Management and closed its acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021, impacting period-over-period comparisons for the Firm and Investment Management. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.  I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Morgan Stanley delivered another record year of profits and results in 2021, generating a full year ROTCE of 20%. Performance was strong in each business. In Institutional Securities, we showed strength and gained share. And in Wealth Management, we added over $430 billion of net new assets, bringing total client assets to nearly $5 trillion. We drove our strategic vision forward Investment Management, successfully closing our acquisition of Eaton Vance in the year and created a premier asset manager, which itself has $1.6 trillion of assets under management. Sharon will discuss the details of the quarter and the full year shortly. But first, as always, I will walk through our annual strategic updates. If you turn to the document and start on Slide 3. At the beginning of last year, we set two-year objectives with the expectation that 2021 would be a transition year as we work through our integrations. Clearly, the Firm's performance exceeded the expectations we had for 2021 heading into that year. With the early successes of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions and the Firm's overall momentum, we entered 2022 ahead of plan. Turning to Slide 4. First, I'll focus on our 12-year transformation and where the Firm is today. History offers perspective on our track record. Next, I'll highlight where we've built unique competitive advantages around each of our businesses and how we expect to grow and maintain our leading positions. Then I will address our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders. And finally, I'll touch on how, when taken together, this should lead to further multiple expansion. To begin with our longer-term evolution, Slide 5 highlights the transformation of Morgan Stanley into a more balanced, higher returning firm today. Total revenues are more than double the level of 2009 with each business significantly growing and contributing to the Firm's enhanced profitability. Each of our businesses now have defensible and sustainable competitive advantages to protect and drive their leading positions. Start with Institutional Securities on Slide 6. Looking back to 2014, when we had recovered from the financial crisis, but before we reset our strategy and restructured some of this business, we've increased share both overall and individually across business lines. Share continues to aggregate to the industry leaders, and we expect this trend to hold. Our competitive position is strong, and as demonstrated in the very active markets for the last two years, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities to hold, if not gain, share across the division. Moving to Slide 7. Our integrated investment bank delivered $30 billion of revenues in 2021 and continues to demonstrate operating leverage, highlighted by our expanding margins. Our footprint is balanced around the world, putting us in a leading tier of investment banks with global scale. Our franchise has never been stronger, and we have seen tangible results from the collaboration between our segments. Shifting to Wealth Management on Slide 8. The growth we have seen in 2021 has been unprecedented. We added nearly $1 trillion in client assets in a single year. Scale advantages propelled growth, and we added $438 billion of net new assets in the last 12 months. This predominantly organic growth is the result of our consistent and focused execution on our integration and expansion initiatives and puts us in a leading position. The journey over the last few years has demonstrated the out of the possible. With respect to net new asset growth, this business has gone from very low single digits in the last decade to 4% to 6% more recently to unprecedented growth this year. Obviously, it's still early days, but the verticals are in place. Before we commit to specific guidance for net new asset growth, we need more time to better understand the power of these channels. But what I can tell you is that the proof points are strong, and we feel great about where we are today in the business potential. Turning to Slide 9. With the top advisor-led business in the industry, complemented by leading workplace and self-directed offerings, the wealth franchise we've built as a category 1. We already serve nearly $5 trillion of client assets, and overall revenue on assets remains high over 50 basis points, underlining this segment is -- underlining this segment as an economic engine for the Firm. As we think about the growth ahead, we are most excited about the nearly 15 million relationships we have across channels and the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client on to the platform. On Slide 10, we look more closely at workplace, which I'm incredibly excited about for the future. As we've said before, we see this channel as a funnel for client and asset acquisition to sustain growth going forward. We now have over $500 billion of unvested assets in this channel and expect to retain an increasing proportion as they vest. In 2021, we had a 24% retention rate. That compares with 21% the previous year. Given our focused effort, our long-term goal is to reach 30% retention. This new metric illustrates the strength of the workplace business to augment net new assets to Wealth Management. Moving to Investment Management on Slide 11. Our platform has transformed into premier and growing asset manager. Our distinctive capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated client value as endorsed by $115 billion of net flows in the year. Total AUM is now $1.6 trillion, and our more durable asset management fees are nearly triple what they were in 2014. If you look closely with our Investment Management business on Slide 12, you can see we're a leader and growing where it matters most. Customization, specifically direct indexing through the premier Parametric brand, sustainability and alternatives are each areas of increasing client demand. We've strengthened our position across these categories with robust investment our capabilities, and we've seen meaningful asset under management growth as a result. Moreover, the complementary nature of distribution networks with Eaton Vance's powerful U.S. retail distribution capabilities and MSIM's strength in international distribution enhances our client reach. We're encouraged by early signs of success in leveraging the greater combined network, along with our world-class equity franchise and value-added fixed income platform, and we expect these areas will continue to drive growth into the future. Finally, on Slide 11, as we look ahead, we expect rates to rise. We expect approximately $500 million of incremental NII in Wealth Management this year based on the year-end forward curve. Additionally, we expect another $200 million this year from the reversal of fee waivers in our Investment Management business. To further measure our rate sensitivity, we look at what happens if there is an incremental 100 basis point parallel shift in rates beyond the curve. That would deliver another $1.3 billion, which largely goes to the bottom line. While we certainly don't expect this additional shift to happen this year, the Firm will clearly benefit substantially as rates rise over the next several years. Pivoting to our capital return strategy on Slide 14. Our increased earnings power, supported by revenues from more durable sources, has enabled us to double our annualized dividend to $2.80 just last year while, at the same time, executing on meaningful share repurchases. Notwithstanding the returns we're making to shareholders and the investments we make in our business, we continue to have an excess capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 16% at year-end after paying our dividend, executing on our repurchase plan and accounting for the impact of SA-CCR. And as further illustrated on Slide 15, a growing net income has provided us the flexibility to reduce our share count. While we added 300 million shares from our 2 large acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, we continue to execute on our meaningful buyback program and have brought back our share count back to just under $1.8 billion from $2 billion in 2014. Taking all this together, Slide 16 highlights the fundamentals we have in place to drive future multiple expansion. We have scale, significant growth opportunities in wealth and investment management, coupled with a leading institutional business, and a strong commitment to capital return. The Morgan Stanley brand has never been stronger. We've been fortunate enough to acquire additional brands in the last few years that have tremendous value in expanding our footprint. The sum of these elements supports multiple expansion for the combined company. Slide 17 shows our performance goals. Of note, we are increasing our ROTCE goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model. We are laser focused on delivering value to our clients, our shareholders and our employees, and we believe an ROTCE in excess of 20% is achievable. As we look to the longer term, with the support of our track record behind us, we're adding a new goal, a long-term goal to achieve $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management.  As always, our targets are subject, of course, to major market moves or changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment. However, with the outlook we have now, we fully expect to achieve our goals.  I'll now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. And together, we will take your questions. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced record revenues of $59.8 billion in 2021 and ended the year on a strong footing with fourth quarter revenues of $14.5 billion. All 3 businesses contributed to the extremely strong full year results, reflecting high levels of client engagement and active market. Excluding integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 20.2% for the full year and 20.4% for the fourth quarter, and EPS was $8.22 and $2.08, respectively. Even while investing in our business, we continue to demonstrate operating leverage led by Institutional Securities. The full year efficiency ratio was 67.1%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 66.3%, down from 68.4% in 2020. Total expenses in the year were [$40.1 billion]. The increase in total expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs and higher compensation on higher revenues. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered excellent full year performance with record revenues of $29.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $6.7 billion. Our integrated approach, global footprint and balance across business lines continues to distinguish our model. Underscoring the operating leverage in the business, pretax margin was 39.6% for the full year, increasing from 34.6% in the prior year. Investment Banking revenues were a record $10.3 billion for the full year. While each business delivered record results, Advisory and Equity underwriting led the year-over-year improvement. Corporate clients actively pursued strategic opportunities and sponsor-deployed capital. IPO issuances were exceptionally robust in the year. And from a geographical perspective, results were led by the Americas, along with sustained strength in EMEA. Fourth quarter revenues of $20.4 billion -- excuse me, of from the prior year driven by strength in Advisory. Trends from the third quarter persisted, particularly as results benefited from a broadening of transactions across sectors. Although underwriting revenues moderated overall, equity issuance was strong, and elevated levels of event-driven activity supported fixed income. We continue to invest in our Investment Banking business. Our outlook entering 2022 is strong, and our pipelines continue to be healthy across products. CEO confidence remains high, and markets remain open and constructive. Additionally, Advisory transactions should support strong capital market issuance. Equity full year revenues were a record $11.4 billion, increasing 15% from the prior year as client engagement remained high. The increase versus the prior year was driven by strength in prime brokerage and, from a geographical perspective, Asia. Revenues were $2.9 billion in the quarter. Increased revenues in prime brokerage on higher client balances were offset by declines in cash and derivatives on lower client activity versus the prior fourth quarter. This quarter also included a mark-to-market gain of $225 million on a certain strategic investment. Fixed income revenues were $7.5 billion for the full year, declining 15% from the last year's exceptional results. The full year decline was driven by tighter bid offer spreads in macro and credit corporates partially offset by securitized products. Quarterly revenues of $1.2 billion were 31% lower than the prior year, reflecting a challenging trading environment and rates and lower volumes and tighter bid offer spreads and credit. Further, client engagement tempered in December, reflecting seasonal patterns impacting results. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.2 billion and a PBT margin of 25.5%. Excluding $346 million of integration-related expenses, the PBT margin was 26.9%. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year, and the PBT margin was 22.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $109 million, the PBT margin for the quarter was 24.4%. Quarterly margin was negatively impacted by seasonal expenses and certain compensation and benefits decisions made to further support our employees. Given the full annual impact of these decisions was taken in the fourth quarter, the impact was amplified in this quarter's margin. Going forward, this will be spread throughout the year pro rata. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022, we expect the PBT margin to be more in line with the 2021 full year margin, excluding integration-related expenses. This business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform. Client assets grew nearly $1 trillion this year and now stands at $4.9 trillion. Fee-based flows were an incredible $179 billion in the year, recording growth in fee-based assets of $1.8 trillion or 25% higher than last year. In the quarter, asset management revenues were $3.7 billion. Net new assets of $438 million in the year represent 11% annual growth of beginning period assets. Momentum was carried through the fourth quarter, which saw net new assets of $127 billion. We saw strong asset generation from both existing clients and net new clients driven by the advisor-led channel. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain productive advisors. Net new assets growth is further buoyed by positive momentum in our newer channels, namely workplace. Our results demonstrate the tremendous asset generation capability of our platform. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, declining 23% from the prior year, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus prior year, revenues were flat. The workplace continues to gain traction. Our total number of participants we now read stands at 5.6 million, 14% higher than last year, and unvested assets now exceed $500 billion. As James mentioned, we are reporting on a new metric to show the percentage of stock plan assets that vest and remain within Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. E*TRADE previously disclosed a similar metrics. The definition going forward will measure the retention of the value of vested stocks on a rolling 12- to 24-month period. This new metric will allow us to measure the potential strength of workplace to service the funnel to grow our asset base. We saw 24% retention in 2021, which compares to 21% in 2020. As James mentioned, over time, we believe that number can reach retention for our stock plan administration business. Going forward, we plan to disclose this metric annually. Bank lending balances grew by $31 billion in the year, and now stand at $129 billion. Strong client demand for securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase. Net interest income was $1.4 billion in the quarter driven by strong lending growth and the benefit of fully phased-in funding synergies. The fourth quarter NII is a reasonable base to inform 2022. This year, NII will be impacted by the forward curve on lending growth. On rates, while the timing and the magnitude of the rate hikes is uncertain, we should benefit from rising rates and the realization of the forward curve. This would imply an estimated $500 million of additional NII this year, largely weighted to the back half of the year. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand. And while growth is likely to moderate some, we expect approximately $20 billion of loan growth in the year. Finally, the integration of the E*TRADE continues to go well. We are encouraged by continued client engagement and are seeing rate clients take advantage of Morgan Stanley capabilities being introduced on the E*TRADE platform. Building on our digital client experience, clients are now able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on. We have successfully merged E*TRADE's bank legal entities with Morgan Stanley. Throughout the integration efforts, we continue to focus on a unified client experience while providing clients choice. Completing this integration successfully remains a key investment priority. Moving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult. So I will make my comments primarily on an absolute basis. Investment Management reported annual revenues of $6.2 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.8 billion. Our results continue to demonstrate the diversification of this business and a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenue. Total AUM rose to a record high of $1.6 trillion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $1.1 trillion. Total net flows were $12 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term net flows were slightly negative. For the full year, net flows were $115 billion. Asset management and related fees were $1.6 billion in the quarter. The 8% sequential increase was driven by higher performance fees. As a reminder, performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter. Performance-based income and other revenues were $166 million, reflecting broad-based gains in our diversified alternative platform. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on track. In the first half of this year, we will bring a number of Eaton Vance and Calvert funds onto our international distribution platform. We are also now offering MSIM model portfolios on the E*TRADE platform, and we are seeing positive traction. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets were essentially flat to the prior quarter at $472 billion. We adopted SA-CCR on December 1, resulting in a $23 billion RWA increase. This was offset by a decline in activity and lower market levels towards the end of the quarter. Our SA-CCR mitigation efforts were better than we anticipated and resulted in an impact lower than our initial guidance to produce a better outcome. We repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of common stock during the quarter. We remain well capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR, and our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%, flat to the prior quarter. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. And absent any changes to tax law, we expect our 2022 tax rate to be in line with 2021. We which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. In terms of our outlook for calendar year 2022, the exit rate of our Wealth and Investment Management asset base and the integrations of our acquisitions set these businesses up to further support results. As it relates to institutional securities, while it remains difficult to forecast this business, the banking pipeline looks healthy and the year has started off well. That said, a lot will depend on monetary and fiscal policy and its impact on sentiment.  With that, we will now open the line up for questions.\nOperator: We are now ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu : Good morning, guys. So James, on the -- organic growth has been remarkably strong and you keep calling for a slowdown on organic growth, but we're not seeing any -- sort of any evidence of slowing anything, you\u2019re accelerating here. I guess a couple of questions on that. Can you give us a bit more flavor around what's driving organic growth? How much of it is retention versus recruiting? On recruiting, who are you gaining share from? And then I would imagine you have quite a bit of visibility into the recruiting pipeline. So any sense of like how long do you think the sort of strength can continue?\nJames Gorman: Good morning, Christian. I think you're talking about net new money, I assume, right?\nChristian Bolu : Correct. Correct.\nJames Gorman: Yes. Yes. I mean it's not a simple answer because in the old days, it was simple. It was a function of money that you lost by financial advisors leaving and money you gain by recruiting financial advisors. And obviously, that's a sort of sorry way to run a business. It basically settles your P&L for the next nine years to buy a little bit of joy in the near-term. Fortunately, we've outgrown that. The source of net new money comes from several places. Number one, as you heard the retention in the workplace space is much better than what we did pre E*TRADE. I mean, we -- I think it went from 21% to 24% last year, but pre-E*TRADE, it was much, much lower and pre-Solium. Number two, the reality is wealthy people get wealthier quicker than people who are less wealthy get wealthy. And we've got a lot of them. We -- now with our -- the sophistication of our network, the linkages we have to invest in banking across our top financial advisors, the family office structure the team has put in place are all drivers of growth that we didn't have before. I mean just the new assets that are brought in from our Investment Banking relationships sort of across the house, whereas in the past, we never really introduced across the house. It's truly running like one Firm. Thirdly, we're just not losing many people. I mean that's the reality relative to previous years, where being significant net gainers. And that's not because we're doing stupid recruiting deals. That's because we're not losing a lot of people. Now we are doing recruiting deals. There are talented people in the market. They're not coming from one1 particular Firm or another. We don't focus on firms, we focus on individuals, and that has been doing well. Then you add in things like the technology the team has put in place in Wealth Management, sort of the virtual advisor type technology where you leverage the best talent we have across the whole country, all of the old platform that is being built out, where we now provide the product that you would have had to go to another Firm to get. And finally, you bring in the deposits and what we've done with the bank and the online banking. And then you throw on top of that E*TRADE and what that's been doing in growth. And so Christian, it's an interesting story. It's many, many parts, which is why we're confident it's going to keep going. Just recruiting, that's different. You turn that spigot on or off, but it's not just recruiting. So I think there's going to be strong organic growth. I mean these numbers, we said unprecedented for reason. It had never -- we've never seen -- it's 10%, 11% organic growth year-over-year. That's got to be the best in the industry, and overwhelmingly, the best in our history. And it's better than, frankly, many of the traditional faster-growing, so-called faster-growing companies. So we're really excited about it. I don't think 10% or 11% is realistic to hold. But certainly, we're not going back to anywhere near where we were in the old days.\nSharon Yeshaya: If I can also add to it, Christian, I would just say if you actually look at the data, is relatively, as James said, balanced across many of these different sectors. But as you think of just the advisor channel, you're seeing not only -- we've, I think, spent a lot of time speaking to the community around assets held away. We are seeing existing clients bringing assets as well as new clients bringing assets to the advisor-led channel. So you are seeing a balance of both.\nChristian Bolu : Okay. Thank you. For my second question, on expenses, really nice control in the quarter, but all your peers are speaking about elevated expense growth going forward to retain talent and just to invest for growth. Can you talk about just longer-term, how you're thinking about balancing sort of that good expense control that we like while continuing to invest for the long-term?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. I think we have managed expenses well. I think that we always are cognizant of the pressures around expenses, both on the wage side and on the non-comp side. If you think about the comp side, I think we constantly feel that we've paid for performance, and that's sort of been the model that we have. But as you also think about the non-comps, we're investing in our integration. We're investing in technology, resiliency, cyber. And I think we're also putting in place different types of investments as you think about positioning Morgan Stanley up for growth and making sure that we have the right people and the processes in place to do that. But there is also inherent operating margin in -- or excuse me, operating leverage in the model, and that's been something that we've been able to demonstrate, I think, this quarter as well as over the course of the year.\nJames Gorman: Yes. I'd say, Christian, obviously, this is going to be a hot topic because it's all anybody wants to talk about all of a sudden is expense management for 2022. I'm not going to talk about competitors, but you've got to look at business models. I mean, we're a different business model. Just take our Wealth Management business, which is $24-plus billion in revenue. Those advisors are paid on a grid. There is no inflation on it. It's based upon what they produce. Most of our investment bank is similarly paid based on bonus and that's based on what they produce, what our performance is. If that goes up, they go up, which they did this year and we were thrilled to do that. So we've invested a lot in technology, but we've also bought companies. As I said before, we didn't just buy E*TRADE and Solium and Eaton Vance, we bought technology businesses within them, which we would have been developing ourselves, the online banking business within E*TRADE, the Solium workplace platform, which is basically -- it's basically software programming business, the Parametric platform with Eaton Vance, all of these are things which if we built would have been very expensive. So buy versus build, we made that trade-off. So it's a combination of all of those. We're very comfortable with our expense situation right now. And I don't know, we're just -- I guess, it's a different business model.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sharon, I just wanted to ask a question on the slide that you've got in the deck on the realization of forward curve as well as the liquidity revenue and whatnot. So I'm guessing that the $200 million in liquidity revenue is waivers and the recovery of waivers. But that number seems a little low. Wasn't the waiver in the third quarter, $169 million? At least that's what was in the Q. And so can you maybe help reconcile where you're currently running on waivers versus that $200 million?\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely. So this $200 million, what we're reflecting here, Brennan, it's a good question, is the forward curve. And so the forward curve has the first rate hike in effect that we looked at from December 31. So that's in the second quarter. So therefore, it's the amount that you would expect to realize this year, should that forward curve play out. That's the way this slide was illustrated. And just to drive the distinction, though, between what you see in the Q, the Q has all different types of waivers. It's not just money market waivers. But you're right to say that this number on a relative basis would be considered low if you're thinking about a full year context.\nBrennan Hawken: Got it. Okay. So we could calibrate both the NII number and the liquidity for it. Okay. Excellent. And then when we think about -- you made a comment, I think, Sharon, when you were talking about the impact in the fourth quarter of Wealth Management margins, clearly low, right, full year impact of that benefit. But it sounded like what you said was, when we were thinking about entering 2022 that the full year is the way to think about it. But that's just like -- I just want to sort of clarify and understand. Did you mean that, that was the jumping off point? Or that that's the right way to think about 2022 in total? Because I'd assume with a lot of the rate benefit coming, continued operating leverage and whatnot, you'd be talking more about it jumping off point than thinking about the full year. But am I reading too much into that?\nSharon Yeshaya: No, you're not. Thank you for clarifying that. That's 100% accurate. What we were referring to is the first quarter of 2022 and using this full year number as a good launching off point is sort of setting you up. That's obviously ex-integration for the first quarter. So yes, as the rate rises, that should increase the margin as it goes forward throughout the course of the year.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Okay. Hopefully, I can sneak one in because it was a clarification question.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Don't worry, Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: The Investment Management fee rate was like really pleasantly surprisingly improved despite the fact that we're still waiving fees like we just talked about. Could you talk a little about -- I know Eaton Vance is early and there's still -- that is still progressing and whatnot. But I kind of thought that the third quarter fee rate would have settled fully but there was an improvement. Can you talk about what drove that improvement? Is that sustainable? Or was there some one-time lumpiness in there?\nSharon Yeshaya: It's the fourth quarter. Those -- you see some of the rates moving up in the fourth quarter, Brennan. But overall, I think as you look forward and you think about fees more broadly, we obviously have a larger asset base. I think it all ends back to this idea of growth. And that's -- I think, really ties to James' slide as well, which really thinks about what are we trying to build, leaning into growth and really thinking about creating durable fee revenue streams over time.\nBrennan Hawken: So when you say the fourth quarter, I mean, I was excluding the performance fee because you guys break that out. Are there performance fees that are also embedded in the asset management line, too, that have the seasonality?\nSharon Yeshaya: No.\nBrennan Hawken: No. Okay. So the core fee rate is a good fee rate to think about going forward?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. And we also disclosed them in the Q and in the K.\nOperator: The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI Group.\nGlenn Schorr: James, a little, tiny qualifier, if I could. Last quarter, I think you made the comment of, well, organic growth shouldn't be likely below 5%. Today, you said more like it won't be like the old days. Is it still like the old days, meaning that when you're in that 4% range pre all the additions and the opportunities you have in hand? Are we still looking at like should be 5 and above? I don't need to pin you down. I would just want to make sure I'm getting the right context.\nJames Gorman: Yes. I don't know what -- I'm not sure I heard you correctly about what you said about what I said last quarter. But let me say what I'm going to say this quarter. Listen, we -- historically, back in the bad days, we actually had negative growth, right? We lost more money than we brought in. Then for a bunch of years through the early sort of '12 through '15, we were probably running at 1%, 2%. The couple of years before the E*TRADE acquisition and before, frankly, the business really hit its stride, we were sort of running around 3%, 4%, 5%, and we kind of guided 4% to 6% was reasonable for long-term predictions. This past year, I think we grew at 11%, which is -- I mean, it's freakish, right, Glenn? This is -- you're talking about over $400 billion of new money. There are a lot of asset management companies that aren't $400 billion in size. I don't think that's sustainable. I mean, God I'd love it, but I don't think it's sustainable, but we're not going back to 3%, 4%. I don't know if it's 5, 6, 7, somewhere in that zone. But it's going to be a very healthy growth rate. And you compound that out over what is now $4.9 trillion, you get to really big numbers, which is why, combined with wealth and asset management, we put them together and currently, they're about $6.5 trillion. We can see a path to $10 trillion here, and we want to call that because we believe that's going to happen. So that's -- we're in that sort of, I don't know, 4, 5, 6, 7. It's -- and that's why I deliberately said in the script that it was too early to put a net new money target out there. We needed to see where this really settled.\nGlenn Schorr: Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Thanks. The other one, James, is the long-term goals, if you look at the last slide, I think those are great long-term goals. And if you could do that sustainably, I think you would get your multiple expansion, people would love it.\nJames Gorman: Would be $200 stock, my friend.\nGlenn Schorr: The high-class problem that you have is you kind of did some of them this year or last year, so maybe if -- again, if I could just have you part some more, then just go through, how to think about sustainability and what you're building towards what long-term means just so we don't do the up and down game every quarter. So like, \"Oh, wait, you didn't hit your ROTC target this quarter\u2026?\nJames Gorman: Yes. Listen, this is the problem with putting goals out there. You hear them and everybody says, \"Great, what's the new one?\" Our goals last year, our 2-year goals was 14 to -- take ROTCE of 14% to 16%. We happen to hit 20% this year. It was an unbelievably good year. And if we were really operating with a permanent 20-plus percent ROTCE, the stock would be much higher than it is now. In fact, I think it should be higher than it is now, but that's a different issue. So we put out 20%-plus. I don't think you're going to find another bank in the world that's putting out a 20%-plus ROTCE goal. And over the long term, we're not saying forever, that's why we separated client assets at 10 trillion as longer term not to be too cute about it, but we think that, obviously, just mathematically, if you do 5% net new money growth, you have 5% to 6% market appreciation, you're talking about a sort of just mathematically, full year to 5-year time zone to get to 10 trillion. By the way, in 2006, our total assets as a company were $1 trillion. We're now at 6.5. So it's not like an impossible lift. On efficiency ratio, when I started in this job, I think our efficiency ratio was in the low 80s. We have grounded down every single year. And our range over the last -- including this year, 2021, '22 was 69 to 72. We obviously beat that. We had -- as I said, we had a blowout year. But we're consistently of the view that, notwithstanding all the talk about expense pressure, our efficiency ratio will stay under 70%. That for long-term management and managing growth and investing in the business, you got to balance growth versus expense, I think that's a phenomenal outcome. And Wealth Management, our long-term goals there was 69 to 72 -- I'm sorry, 26 to 30, we've now said 30% plus. When we get the kick up from the forward curve, we get some of the rate increase in the next couple of years. We finished the integration expenses. You're going to see that number go up. No question about that. So that's the context. And frankly, I just like the round 20, 70, 30, 10, felt like a nice clean sheet. Everybody can follow it. And that's what we're planning on.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So I was hoping to unpack some of the assumptions underpinning the 30% margin target for the Wealth segment. Looking at the adjusted Wealth Management margin this past year of 27% and the 30% target is certainly a significant improvement from where you've been run rating over like the past decade-plus. In this new world order following the E*TRADE acquisition, it does feel a bit conservative when layering in the synergies as well as simply the realization of the forward curve. And I wanted to see if we should expect the NII windfall to largely fall to the bottom line? And can you speak to what you believe is an achievable margin goal when contemplating a lot of the tailwinds or benefits you cited from higher run rate organic growth, the upside from higher rates and just the full realization of trade synergies?\nJames Gorman: Steve, I have to say I love you. You're the first person in history to call a 30%-plus pretax margin Wealth Management as conservative. I mean we started we're like 3%. So listen, there's nobody in history, I think, has ever generated 30-plus percent number. I think it was back -- if you go back, it was Shearson in the fourth quarter of 1999, I believe, generated a 29% margin. And that was because they were doing, let's just say, a lot of Internet-based buy and selling, the clients back then. So that was like an artificial period. Listen, there is the reason we put the plus on it. We don't think 30% is the ceiling. But let's run before we sprint here. We've gone from 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 to 25. 27%, 28% margins with growth, that's a phenomenal story. If we can do 30%, which we will do because of the way rates are going, it gets even better. So 30%-plus, there's no great magic to it. It's just the math of how we think the business plays out the next couple of years. I don't know what the plus is going to be. It might be 0.1 or it might be 5.\nSteven Chubak: Fair enough, James. Although last year, I think you had a similar response, and I pressed you on the ROTCE target and it was raised. So hopefully, we'll see a similar outcome this time around.\nJames Gorman: Maybe you're clairvoyant, I don't know.\nSteven Chubak: Well, just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the upcoming changes to the capital regime. There's certainly some significant changes coming down the pike as part of Basel IV. I know we might be jumping the gun. We don't have a proposal yet from the Fed. But I was hoping you could just share some preliminary thoughts on how you see this potentially impacting minimum capital requirements at the Firm. And any learnings just from the SA-CCR experience in terms of your ability to mitigate some of those RWA inflationary pressures?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Why don't I take the last one first, which I think the overarching theme is really around adaptation? As it specifically relates to SA-CCR, I think there was data mitigation that we were able to achieve. And I think we're proud of being able to focus and move forward. As it relates to Basel, no surprise that you asked the question, Steve. So it's nice to hear from you on that one. But obviously, there is no final rule yet. I think there's -- the difficulty in saying something is that there's often and can be offset between these rules. And so that's something that I would bear in mind as you think through it and as we all think through it. But what I think is really the point is that we have adopted really well. And we also have 280 basis points, I think, as James showed, of excess capital on the CET1 metric. And so I think we're really comfortable with our position, and we're comfortable to better understand the capital rules as they come our way.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Mayo: Since, James, you're looking for the 20% ROTCE permanently, how much longer do you plan to stay as CEO? And by setting such a high target, are you encouraging some extra risk-taking?\nJames Gorman: I'll take the second question -- second part of the question first. No. We, in fact, did a 20% ROTCE this year without taking extra risk taking with the movement in rates, the scaling the business, the completed integration to come of Eaton Vance and E*TRADE and the removal of those costs. The moats around the business and the embedded growth we have in net new assets, I don't think these are -- involve risk-taking at all. This is not about growing the balance sheet and growing risk-weighted assets. This is about growing durable fee sources, durable revenues and managing our expenses. I don't know if we're going to achieve it every single year, but we certainly -- it's certainly a goal, and it's a go for reason. So no, I don't think it involves taking extra risk. I mean, fundamentally, our business model is different, Mike, as you know, we generate $30 billion and it's going up from wealth and asset management that don't involve taking a lot of risk. Our investment bank -- traditional Investment Banking doesn't involve taking a lot of risk. Some of the underwriting, obviously, does. Some of the trading does. But a lot of the -- look at equities, a lot of the equities business is buying and selling on behalf of clients. So no, that's not -- the plan is not after all these years to dial up the risk.  And I'm not going to repeat what I've said many times, I'm not leaving now, and I'm not going to be here in 5 years, and it's up to the Board. We're developing successors. I'll be here a few years. And I want to see these integrations done. I want to see us firmly on this path. And I want to hand it over to somebody else who can take us to the next decade.\nMichael Mayo: Great. And then one follow-up. As far as the ins and outs, that's helpful to give the market share. And the numbers speak for themselves, 15% Investment Banking market share, 23% Equity share. But on the one hand, I think you're one of the biggest providers to the tech industry. And with tech having some pain recently, I wonder what percent of your Investment Banking business is to the tech sector. And then offsetting that, perhaps there are some other industries that are coming back online after the pandemic.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I would actually point to the fact that what I said, I think, in the last 2 quarters, is that we're seeing a broadening out of the advisor activity. It's not specific to any one sector. And I think that's been what's really contributed to the healthy pipelines in that business. across all the Investment Banking. And then as you look in sales and trading, it's a highly diversified model and has not really pinned down to any one specific sector.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor: Can you just talk a bit big picture on the industry wallet for both banking and trading as rates rise and as the Fed unwinds the balance sheet? Obviously, there's been some benefits the last couple of years, and we're all trying to figure out do we anchor to the more recent last couple of years, go back to pre-COVID, if you think about the wallet. And my follow-up will be on your positioning specifically.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think the -- if you think about the industry wallet, -- There have been a couple of things that I would mention. One is, obviously, as I said, if you look specifically at Investment Banking, you've seen different types of activity. You see different types of corporates and sponsors, which has been one of the contributors of a greater wallet. But then if you also think about the Sales & Trading franchise and the movement there, the activity has changed. I think that you were looking back -- if you think back to pre-2018, '17, '19, there was obviously less activity with central banks all having a very similar approach and one rate. Obviously, as you inject rates rising, you do -- you would expect or one should expect different types of volatility and different diversification amongst products, which could contribute to a bigger or a different type of wallet that you saw in the early 2020 to period. That being said, I mean, obviously, none of us have a crystal ball. I think right now, what we do know is that activity is high. I think there's a lot of client differentiation and a robustness really in that type of wallet more broadly. But we'll have to see how it goes. And I think the point I was trying to make in my conclusion is we don't know how any of it will impact sentiment. And I think that's the big piece that is out there is a factor that we have to watch.\nMatthew O'Connor: Fair enough. And then in terms of your positioning, obviously, Slide 6 of your deck shows very strong market share gains in the last few years. As you think about the market kind of ebbing and flowing, is the goal to hold the share, and this kind of ties back into some of the expense pressures in the industry where some of your peers are either invested quite a bit this last year or plan to in the future years? How do we think about the segments and you already have such strong share in equities, for example, but fixed income is an area where you've talked about being somewhere in between on the? So how do you think about those businesses from a competitive point of view going forward?\nSharon Yeshaya: So I think that when you -- what we would point to is I think this is a really -- it's a scale-driven model. We've put a lot of moats in place. I think having a global reach across different pieces contributes to the ability to actually hold or gain share across the Investment Banking division and -- or excuse me, the Institutional Securities franchise more broadly. If you think about the equities, we have a very strong very strong franchise there. Investment banking, as I've said before, we continue to invest in that business. And then if you look at fixed income, I think we continue to feel good about that business, our client positioning, and we've gained share over the last couple of years, and we feel good about being rightsized and there for our clients as it relates to those needs.\nOperator: The next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess, Sharon, I was wondering if, one, you could just get a mark-to-market in terms of an update on all the integration, where we are and when do we expect to fully get that behind us. And just tied to that, I think, James, you've in the past talked about looking at E*TRADE scaling that up globally. Just give us a sense of is there something that can happen in the near term. And what's the optionality there on E*TRADE and taking it global?\nSharon Yeshaya: So why don't I start on the integration. I think where we -- what we had said was we looked for approximately a 3-year integration period. We have seen some -- and this is specific to E*TRADE, we have seen obviously a portion of the integration-related spend over the course of the last 2 years. We would expect the vast majority of the integration-related expenses to be pulled forward into 2022 with a slight residual in 2023 but most of that happening in 2022. And I think that what you'll see later in the 2023 space will be more on the back end and not really a client -- not really client-facing. As it relates to the actual cost synergies that we've seen, we're in a very good place. I think that it's exceeded our expectations in terms of the guidance that we gave in terms of a time line and seeing those come through. But on a holistic basis, we stick to the cost synergy guidance that we gave when we first announced the transaction.\nJames Gorman: On the international, I mean, E*TRADE already manages some plans internationally. We don't have immediate plans to take the platform outside the U.S., but it's certainly part of the long-term strategy. So I'd say right now, let's get the integration done. Let's prove out the case here, get the cost synergies we talked about sort of close the books on that, and then we're looking for further expansion.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just a separate question around -- there's some concern that the Fed is behind the curve in terms of monetary policy, how concerned are you in terms of the risk of an accident happening with one of your clients within the capital markets business if the Fed has to hike faster or get to QT sooner than expected? Any thoughts around that?\nJames Gorman: We've got a lot of clients. So I'm sure some of them are well positioned for rate hike. Some are -- it's very hard to predict that, that point suggests we're going to get 3 to 4 rate hikes this year and 3 to 4 next year. That feels kind of right. That gets us back to sort of near normal. Normal would be about 10 increases from here, gets us to about 2.5%. If people aren't positioned to manage getting back to normal, then it's kind of -- I mean, it's sort of their problem. It's not -- I'm not particularly worried about it, to be honest. And we don't try and project how people are going to change their positioning with what is a fairly predictable set of outcomes, which is we will have a normalization of interest rates at some point in the next couple of years.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. \nJeremy Sigee: I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. The 2 related questions really about the wealth management growth because, obviously, that's just such a strong theme in what you're doing. The first one is I think the new metric you're giving us, the retention invested assets. That's an interesting metric and a useful one. Could you talk about how you're driving that in terms of how you're going to get that higher in terms of how you're approaching those clients and what product you're putting in front of them to drive that higher? And the second question, related, are you seeing any cross-sell or revenue synergy between your 3 Wealth Management channels, Advisory, workplace, self-directed? Or is it still too early for that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So on the first -- on the new metric, I think that the first driver you're going to see is a lot of the companion accounts, right? So we've talked about the fact that we would expect to give everybody on the U.S., a companion account or at least be at 90% by the end of this year, and that's still on track. And what that will allow for is as those assets from stock plans vest into a companion account, you retain them in a Morgan Stanley self-directed type of way.  And then you use -- this will lead to the second question that you asked and sort of tying it together, products like LeadIQ or technology investments like [Project Genome] to better understand our clients and offer us the technology and that agility to give advisors and to provide the right advisors to the right workplace participants. We are already doing that. We already have pilots in place where we are giving different workplace individual advisors. And so I would say that this -- the first step is really getting everybody a companion account and that's part of the integration process. And then the second part is using technology to better match clients such that, while they still get client choice, we're able to offer them the full advice network that Morgan Stanley has to offer.\nJeremy Sigee: That's great. Could I just ask an unrelated follow-up? Do you need to get the CET1 ratio down to support your ROTCE target staying above 20%?\nSharon Yeshaya: Does it -- no, this is a longer-term target. I think you saw it even this year. So I would just retort with look at this particular year and where we were in terms of our CET1 and, obviously, say we were able to do it given the market circumstance. I'd say that over time, however, we continue to look at capital. As we think about how do we best use that capital for investment, returning it to shareholders with dividends, looking at buybacks and then other ways and uses of capital as we have over the course of the last decade.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: I was hoping you could discuss the profitability of the asset management business now that you've had several quarters of Eaton Vance. And I know that deal wasn't cost driven, but wondering if there's any additional synergies? And as you think about money market fee waivers coming through, as you mentioned earlier, the incremental margin on that in the context of the overall profitability of that business?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So I think that the fee waiver sort of speak for themselves, and so I think that gives you a direct number. On the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance integration -- or excuse me, the Investment Management and the Eaton Vance integration, I think that the way to think about it is it wasn't ever a cost savings transaction. The idea was always to marry the platforms, and you've already begun to see that. So if you think about the diversification of the product suite itself, you're in a position where if you see flows in one business go down, you've seen flows go up in other businesses. And so that's given you this ballast almost in that business specifically. But in addition to that, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, if you look at the second thing that we had highlighted a lot when we purchased Eaton Vance was the different distribution networks. So we have an international -- or Morgan Stanley had an international distribution capability that Eaton Vance didn't have. So a product such as Calvert, where you have a cyclical tailwind in terms of -- and a secular tailwind in terms of people being interested in that sustainability space, that is going to be sold using our international distribution channels beginning in the first half of year. I think that shows the progress and momentum that we have in place as you're marrying those 2 different sort of companies and they're coming together as one.\nDaniel Fannon: And one of the other attributes you've highlighted is the Parametric opportunity within Wealth. I guess, is it too early to talk about uptake of that, some of the tax advantage strategies they offer in terms of your Wealth clients?\nSharon Yeshaya: Well, Parametric was already offered and very well received within the Wealth Management platform. I think we're looking for more ways to sell -- to offer that product, I should say, within different parts of the Wealth Management channel.\nOperator: There are no questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Morgan Stanley delivered another record year of profits and results in 2021, generating a full year ROTCE of 20%. Performance was strong in each business. In Institutional Securities, we showed strength and gained share. And in Wealth Management, we added over $430 billion of net new assets, bringing total client assets to nearly $5 trillion. We drove our strategic vision forward Investment Management, successfully closing our acquisition of Eaton Vance in the year and created a premier asset manager, which itself has $1.6 trillion of assets under management. Sharon will discuss the details of the quarter and the full year shortly. But first, as always, I will walk through our annual strategic updates. If you turn to the document and start on Slide 3. At the beginning of last year, we set two-year objectives with the expectation that 2021 would be a transition year as we work through our integrations. Clearly, the Firm's performance exceeded the expectations we had for 2021 heading into that year. With the early successes of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions and the Firm's overall momentum, we entered 2022 ahead of plan. Turning to Slide 4. First, I'll focus on our 12-year transformation and where the Firm is today. History offers perspective on our track record. Next, I'll highlight where we've built unique competitive advantages around each of our businesses and how we expect to grow and maintain our leading positions. Then I will address our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders. And finally, I'll touch on how, when taken together, this should lead to further multiple expansion. To begin with our longer-term evolution, Slide 5 highlights the transformation of Morgan Stanley into a more balanced, higher returning firm today. Total revenues are more than double the level of 2009 with each business significantly growing and contributing to the Firm's enhanced profitability. Each of our businesses now have defensible and sustainable competitive advantages to protect and drive their leading positions. Start with Institutional Securities on Slide 6. Looking back to 2014, when we had recovered from the financial crisis, but before we reset our strategy and restructured some of this business, we've increased share both overall and individually across business lines. Share continues to aggregate to the industry leaders, and we expect this trend to hold. Our competitive position is strong, and as demonstrated in the very active markets for the last two years, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities to hold, if not gain, share across the division. Moving to Slide 7. Our integrated investment bank delivered $30 billion of revenues in 2021 and continues to demonstrate operating leverage, highlighted by our expanding margins. Our footprint is balanced around the world, putting us in a leading tier of investment banks with global scale. Our franchise has never been stronger, and we have seen tangible results from the collaboration between our segments. Shifting to Wealth Management on Slide 8. The growth we have seen in 2021 has been unprecedented. We added nearly $1 trillion in client assets in a single year. Scale advantages propelled growth, and we added $438 billion of net new assets in the last 12 months. This predominantly organic growth is the result of our consistent and focused execution on our integration and expansion initiatives and puts us in a leading position. The journey over the last few years has demonstrated the out of the possible. With respect to net new asset growth, this business has gone from very low single digits in the last decade to 4% to 6% more recently to unprecedented growth this year. Obviously, it's still early days, but the verticals are in place. Before we commit to specific guidance for net new asset growth, we need more time to better understand the power of these channels. But what I can tell you is that the proof points are strong, and we feel great about where we are today in the business potential. Turning to Slide 9. With the top advisor-led business in the industry, complemented by leading workplace and self-directed offerings, the wealth franchise we've built as a category 1. We already serve nearly $5 trillion of client assets, and overall revenue on assets remains high over 50 basis points, underlining this segment is -- underlining this segment as an economic engine for the Firm. As we think about the growth ahead, we are most excited about the nearly 15 million relationships we have across channels and the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client on to the platform. On Slide 10, we look more closely at workplace, which I'm incredibly excited about for the future. As we've said before, we see this channel as a funnel for client and asset acquisition to sustain growth going forward. We now have over $500 billion of unvested assets in this channel and expect to retain an increasing proportion as they vest. In 2021, we had a 24% retention rate. That compares with 21% the previous year. Given our focused effort, our long-term goal is to reach 30% retention. This new metric illustrates the strength of the workplace business to augment net new assets to Wealth Management. Moving to Investment Management on Slide 11. Our platform has transformed into premier and growing asset manager. Our distinctive capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated client value as endorsed by $115 billion of net flows in the year. Total AUM is now $1.6 trillion, and our more durable asset management fees are nearly triple what they were in 2014. If you look closely with our Investment Management business on Slide 12, you can see we're a leader and growing where it matters most. Customization, specifically direct indexing through the premier Parametric brand, sustainability and alternatives are each areas of increasing client demand. We've strengthened our position across these categories with robust investment our capabilities, and we've seen meaningful asset under management growth as a result. Moreover, the complementary nature of distribution networks with Eaton Vance's powerful U.S. retail distribution capabilities and MSIM's strength in international distribution enhances our client reach. We're encouraged by early signs of success in leveraging the greater combined network, along with our world-class equity franchise and value-added fixed income platform, and we expect these areas will continue to drive growth into the future. Finally, on Slide 11, as we look ahead, we expect rates to rise. We expect approximately $500 million of incremental NII in Wealth Management this year based on the year-end forward curve. Additionally, we expect another $200 million this year from the reversal of fee waivers in our Investment Management business. To further measure our rate sensitivity, we look at what happens if there is an incremental 100 basis point parallel shift in rates beyond the curve. That would deliver another $1.3 billion, which largely goes to the bottom line. While we certainly don't expect this additional shift to happen this year, the Firm will clearly benefit substantially as rates rise over the next several years. Pivoting to our capital return strategy on Slide 14. Our increased earnings power, supported by revenues from more durable sources, has enabled us to double our annualized dividend to $2.80 just last year while, at the same time, executing on meaningful share repurchases. Notwithstanding the returns we're making to shareholders and the investments we make in our business, we continue to have an excess capital position. Our CET1 ratio was 16% at year-end after paying our dividend, executing on our repurchase plan and accounting for the impact of SA-CCR. And as further illustrated on Slide 15, a growing net income has provided us the flexibility to reduce our share count. While we added 300 million shares from our 2 large acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, we continue to execute on our meaningful buyback program and have brought back our share count back to just under $1.8 billion from $2 billion in 2014. Taking all this together, Slide 16 highlights the fundamentals we have in place to drive future multiple expansion. We have scale, significant growth opportunities in wealth and investment management, coupled with a leading institutional business, and a strong commitment to capital return. The Morgan Stanley brand has never been stronger. We've been fortunate enough to acquire additional brands in the last few years that have tremendous value in expanding our footprint. The sum of these elements supports multiple expansion for the combined company. Slide 17 shows our performance goals. Of note, we are increasing our ROTCE goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model. We are laser focused on delivering value to our clients, our shareholders and our employees, and we believe an ROTCE in excess of 20% is achievable. As we look to the longer term, with the support of our track record behind us, we're adding a new goal, a long-term goal to achieve $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management.  As always, our targets are subject, of course, to major market moves or changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment. However, with the outlook we have now, we fully expect to achieve our goals.  I'll now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. And together, we will take your questions. Thank you. Good morning, Christian. I think you're talking about net new money, I assume, right? Yes. Yes. I mean it's not a simple answer because in the old days, it was simple. It was a function of money that you lost by financial advisors leaving and money you gain by recruiting financial advisors. And obviously, that's a sort of sorry way to run a business. It basically settles your P&L for the next nine years to buy a little bit of joy in the near-term. Fortunately, we've outgrown that. The source of net new money comes from several places. Number one, as you heard the retention in the workplace space is much better than what we did pre E*TRADE. I mean, we -- I think it went from 21% to 24% last year, but pre-E*TRADE, it was much, much lower and pre-Solium. Number two, the reality is wealthy people get wealthier quicker than people who are less wealthy get wealthy. And we've got a lot of them. We -- now with our -- the sophistication of our network, the linkages we have to invest in banking across our top financial advisors, the family office structure the team has put in place are all drivers of growth that we didn't have before. I mean just the new assets that are brought in from our Investment Banking relationships sort of across the house, whereas in the past, we never really introduced across the house. It's truly running like one Firm. Thirdly, we're just not losing many people. I mean that's the reality relative to previous years, where being significant net gainers. And that's not because we're doing stupid recruiting deals. That's because we're not losing a lot of people. Now we are doing recruiting deals. There are talented people in the market. They're not coming from one1 particular Firm or another. We don't focus on firms, we focus on individuals, and that has been doing well. Then you add in things like the technology the team has put in place in Wealth Management, sort of the virtual advisor type technology where you leverage the best talent we have across the whole country, all of the old platform that is being built out, where we now provide the product that you would have had to go to another Firm to get. And finally, you bring in the deposits and what we've done with the bank and the online banking. And then you throw on top of that E*TRADE and what that's been doing in growth. And so Christian, it's an interesting story. It's many, many parts, which is why we're confident it's going to keep going. Just recruiting, that's different. You turn that spigot on or off, but it's not just recruiting. So I think there's going to be strong organic growth. I mean these numbers, we said unprecedented for reason. It had never -- we've never seen -- it's 10%, 11% organic growth year-over-year. That's got to be the best in the industry, and overwhelmingly, the best in our history. And it's better than, frankly, many of the traditional faster-growing, so-called faster-growing companies. So we're really excited about it. I don't think 10% or 11% is realistic to hold. But certainly, we're not going back to anywhere near where we were in the old days. Yes. I'd say, Christian, obviously, this is going to be a hot topic because it's all anybody wants to talk about all of a sudden is expense management for 2022. I'm not going to talk about competitors, but you've got to look at business models. I mean, we're a different business model. Just take our Wealth Management business, which is $24-plus billion in revenue. Those advisors are paid on a grid. There is no inflation on it. It's based upon what they produce. Most of our investment bank is similarly paid based on bonus and that's based on what they produce, what our performance is. If that goes up, they go up, which they did this year and we were thrilled to do that. So we've invested a lot in technology, but we've also bought companies. As I said before, we didn't just buy E*TRADE and Solium and Eaton Vance, we bought technology businesses within them, which we would have been developing ourselves, the online banking business within E*TRADE, the Solium workplace platform, which is basically -- it's basically software programming business, the Parametric platform with Eaton Vance, all of these are things which if we built would have been very expensive. So buy versus build, we made that trade-off. So it's a combination of all of those. We're very comfortable with our expense situation right now. And I don't know, we're just -- I guess, it's a different business model. Yes. I don't know what -- I'm not sure I heard you correctly about what you said about what I said last quarter. But let me say what I'm going to say this quarter. Listen, we -- historically, back in the bad days, we actually had negative growth, right? We lost more money than we brought in. Then for a bunch of years through the early sort of '12 through '15, we were probably running at 1%, 2%. The couple of years before the E*TRADE acquisition and before, frankly, the business really hit its stride, we were sort of running around 3%, 4%, 5%, and we kind of guided 4% to 6% was reasonable for long-term predictions. This past year, I think we grew at 11%, which is -- I mean, it's freakish, right, Glenn? This is -- you're talking about over $400 billion of new money. There are a lot of asset management companies that aren't $400 billion in size. I don't think that's sustainable. I mean, God I'd love it, but I don't think it's sustainable, but we're not going back to 3%, 4%. I don't know if it's 5, 6, 7, somewhere in that zone. But it's going to be a very healthy growth rate. And you compound that out over what is now $4.9 trillion, you get to really big numbers, which is why, combined with wealth and asset management, we put them together and currently, they're about $6.5 trillion. We can see a path to $10 trillion here, and we want to call that because we believe that's going to happen. So that's -- we're in that sort of, I don't know, 4, 5, 6, 7. It's -- and that's why I deliberately said in the script that it was too early to put a net new money target out there. We needed to see where this really settled. Would be $200 stock, my friend. Yes. Listen, this is the problem with putting goals out there. You hear them and everybody says, \"Great, what's the new one?\" Our goals last year, our 2-year goals was 14 to -- take ROTCE of 14% to 16%. We happen to hit 20% this year. It was an unbelievably good year. And if we were really operating with a permanent 20-plus percent ROTCE, the stock would be much higher than it is now. In fact, I think it should be higher than it is now, but that's a different issue. So we put out 20%-plus. I don't think you're going to find another bank in the world that's putting out a 20%-plus ROTCE goal. And over the long term, we're not saying forever, that's why we separated client assets at 10 trillion as longer term not to be too cute about it, but we think that, obviously, just mathematically, if you do 5% net new money growth, you have 5% to 6% market appreciation, you're talking about a sort of just mathematically, full year to 5-year time zone to get to 10 trillion. By the way, in 2006, our total assets as a company were $1 trillion. We're now at 6.5. So it's not like an impossible lift. On efficiency ratio, when I started in this job, I think our efficiency ratio was in the low 80s. We have grounded down every single year. And our range over the last -- including this year, 2021, '22 was 69 to 72. We obviously beat that. We had -- as I said, we had a blowout year. But we're consistently of the view that, notwithstanding all the talk about expense pressure, our efficiency ratio will stay under 70%. That for long-term management and managing growth and investing in the business, you got to balance growth versus expense, I think that's a phenomenal outcome. And Wealth Management, our long-term goals there was 69 to 72 -- I'm sorry, 26 to 30, we've now said 30% plus. When we get the kick up from the forward curve, we get some of the rate increase in the next couple of years. We finished the integration expenses. You're going to see that number go up. No question about that. So that's the context. And frankly, I just like the round 20, 70, 30, 10, felt like a nice clean sheet. Everybody can follow it. And that's what we're planning on. Steve, I have to say I love you. You're the first person in history to call a 30%-plus pretax margin Wealth Management as conservative. I mean we started we're like 3%. So listen, there's nobody in history, I think, has ever generated 30-plus percent number. I think it was back -- if you go back, it was Shearson in the fourth quarter of 1999, I believe, generated a 29% margin. And that was because they were doing, let's just say, a lot of Internet-based buy and selling, the clients back then. So that was like an artificial period. Listen, there is the reason we put the plus on it. We don't think 30% is the ceiling. But let's run before we sprint here. We've gone from 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 to 25. 27%, 28% margins with growth, that's a phenomenal story. If we can do 30%, which we will do because of the way rates are going, it gets even better. So 30%-plus, there's no great magic to it. It's just the math of how we think the business plays out the next couple of years. I don't know what the plus is going to be. It might be 0.1 or it might be 5. Maybe you're clairvoyant, I don't know. I'll take the second question -- second part of the question first. No. We, in fact, did a 20% ROTCE this year without taking extra risk taking with the movement in rates, the scaling the business, the completed integration to come of Eaton Vance and E*TRADE and the removal of those costs. The moats around the business and the embedded growth we have in net new assets, I don't think these are -- involve risk-taking at all. This is not about growing the balance sheet and growing risk-weighted assets. This is about growing durable fee sources, durable revenues and managing our expenses. I don't know if we're going to achieve it every single year, but we certainly -- it's certainly a goal, and it's a go for reason. So no, I don't think it involves taking extra risk. I mean, fundamentally, our business model is different, Mike, as you know, we generate $30 billion and it's going up from wealth and asset management that don't involve taking a lot of risk. Our investment bank -- traditional Investment Banking doesn't involve taking a lot of risk. Some of the underwriting, obviously, does. Some of the trading does. But a lot of the -- look at equities, a lot of the equities business is buying and selling on behalf of clients. So no, that's not -- the plan is not after all these years to dial up the risk.  And I'm not going to repeat what I've said many times, I'm not leaving now, and I'm not going to be here in 5 years, and it's up to the Board. We're developing successors. I'll be here a few years. And I want to see these integrations done. I want to see us firmly on this path. And I want to hand it over to somebody else who can take us to the next decade. On the international, I mean, E*TRADE already manages some plans internationally. We don't have immediate plans to take the platform outside the U.S., but it's certainly part of the long-term strategy. So I'd say right now, let's get the integration done. Let's prove out the case here, get the cost synergies we talked about sort of close the books on that, and then we're looking for further expansion. We've got a lot of clients. So I'm sure some of them are well positioned for rate hike. Some are -- it's very hard to predict that, that point suggests we're going to get 3 to 4 rate hikes this year and 3 to 4 next year. That feels kind of right. That gets us back to sort of near normal. Normal would be about 10 increases from here, gets us to about 2.5%. If people aren't positioned to manage getting back to normal, then it's kind of -- I mean, it's sort of their problem. It's not -- I'm not particularly worried about it, to be honest. And we don't try and project how people are going to change their positioning with what is a fairly predictable set of outcomes, which is we will have a normalization of interest rates at some point in the next couple of years."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced record revenues of $59.8 billion in 2021 and ended the year on a strong footing with fourth quarter revenues of $14.5 billion. All 3 businesses contributed to the extremely strong full year results, reflecting high levels of client engagement and active market. Excluding integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 20.2% for the full year and 20.4% for the fourth quarter, and EPS was $8.22 and $2.08, respectively. Even while investing in our business, we continue to demonstrate operating leverage led by Institutional Securities. The full year efficiency ratio was 67.1%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 66.3%, down from 68.4% in 2020. Total expenses in the year were [$40.1 billion]. The increase in total expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs and higher compensation on higher revenues. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered excellent full year performance with record revenues of $29.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $6.7 billion. Our integrated approach, global footprint and balance across business lines continues to distinguish our model. Underscoring the operating leverage in the business, pretax margin was 39.6% for the full year, increasing from 34.6% in the prior year. Investment Banking revenues were a record $10.3 billion for the full year. While each business delivered record results, Advisory and Equity underwriting led the year-over-year improvement. Corporate clients actively pursued strategic opportunities and sponsor-deployed capital. IPO issuances were exceptionally robust in the year. And from a geographical perspective, results were led by the Americas, along with sustained strength in EMEA. Fourth quarter revenues of $20.4 billion -- excuse me, of from the prior year driven by strength in Advisory. Trends from the third quarter persisted, particularly as results benefited from a broadening of transactions across sectors. Although underwriting revenues moderated overall, equity issuance was strong, and elevated levels of event-driven activity supported fixed income. We continue to invest in our Investment Banking business. Our outlook entering 2022 is strong, and our pipelines continue to be healthy across products. CEO confidence remains high, and markets remain open and constructive. Additionally, Advisory transactions should support strong capital market issuance. Equity full year revenues were a record $11.4 billion, increasing 15% from the prior year as client engagement remained high. The increase versus the prior year was driven by strength in prime brokerage and, from a geographical perspective, Asia. Revenues were $2.9 billion in the quarter. Increased revenues in prime brokerage on higher client balances were offset by declines in cash and derivatives on lower client activity versus the prior fourth quarter. This quarter also included a mark-to-market gain of $225 million on a certain strategic investment. Fixed income revenues were $7.5 billion for the full year, declining 15% from the last year's exceptional results. The full year decline was driven by tighter bid offer spreads in macro and credit corporates partially offset by securitized products. Quarterly revenues of $1.2 billion were 31% lower than the prior year, reflecting a challenging trading environment and rates and lower volumes and tighter bid offer spreads and credit. Further, client engagement tempered in December, reflecting seasonal patterns impacting results. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.2 billion and a PBT margin of 25.5%. Excluding $346 million of integration-related expenses, the PBT margin was 26.9%. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year, and the PBT margin was 22.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $109 million, the PBT margin for the quarter was 24.4%. Quarterly margin was negatively impacted by seasonal expenses and certain compensation and benefits decisions made to further support our employees. Given the full annual impact of these decisions was taken in the fourth quarter, the impact was amplified in this quarter's margin. Going forward, this will be spread throughout the year pro rata. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022, we expect the PBT margin to be more in line with the 2021 full year margin, excluding integration-related expenses. This business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform. Client assets grew nearly $1 trillion this year and now stands at $4.9 trillion. Fee-based flows were an incredible $179 billion in the year, recording growth in fee-based assets of $1.8 trillion or 25% higher than last year. In the quarter, asset management revenues were $3.7 billion. Net new assets of $438 million in the year represent 11% annual growth of beginning period assets. Momentum was carried through the fourth quarter, which saw net new assets of $127 billion. We saw strong asset generation from both existing clients and net new clients driven by the advisor-led channel. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain productive advisors. Net new assets growth is further buoyed by positive momentum in our newer channels, namely workplace. Our results demonstrate the tremendous asset generation capability of our platform. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, declining 23% from the prior year, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus prior year, revenues were flat. The workplace continues to gain traction. Our total number of participants we now read stands at 5.6 million, 14% higher than last year, and unvested assets now exceed $500 billion. As James mentioned, we are reporting on a new metric to show the percentage of stock plan assets that vest and remain within Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. E*TRADE previously disclosed a similar metrics. The definition going forward will measure the retention of the value of vested stocks on a rolling 12- to 24-month period. This new metric will allow us to measure the potential strength of workplace to service the funnel to grow our asset base. We saw 24% retention in 2021, which compares to 21% in 2020. As James mentioned, over time, we believe that number can reach retention for our stock plan administration business. Going forward, we plan to disclose this metric annually. Bank lending balances grew by $31 billion in the year, and now stand at $129 billion. Strong client demand for securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase. Net interest income was $1.4 billion in the quarter driven by strong lending growth and the benefit of fully phased-in funding synergies. The fourth quarter NII is a reasonable base to inform 2022. This year, NII will be impacted by the forward curve on lending growth. On rates, while the timing and the magnitude of the rate hikes is uncertain, we should benefit from rising rates and the realization of the forward curve. This would imply an estimated $500 million of additional NII this year, largely weighted to the back half of the year. On lending, we continue to see strong lending demand. And while growth is likely to moderate some, we expect approximately $20 billion of loan growth in the year. Finally, the integration of the E*TRADE continues to go well. We are encouraged by continued client engagement and are seeing rate clients take advantage of Morgan Stanley capabilities being introduced on the E*TRADE platform. Building on our digital client experience, clients are now able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on. We have successfully merged E*TRADE's bank legal entities with Morgan Stanley. Throughout the integration efforts, we continue to focus on a unified client experience while providing clients choice. Completing this integration successfully remains a key investment priority. Moving to Investment Management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult. So I will make my comments primarily on an absolute basis. Investment Management reported annual revenues of $6.2 billion and quarterly revenues of $1.8 billion. Our results continue to demonstrate the diversification of this business and a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenue. Total AUM rose to a record high of $1.6 trillion, of which long-term AUM was also a record at $1.1 trillion. Total net flows were $12 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term net flows were slightly negative. For the full year, net flows were $115 billion. Asset management and related fees were $1.6 billion in the quarter. The 8% sequential increase was driven by higher performance fees. As a reminder, performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter. Performance-based income and other revenues were $166 million, reflecting broad-based gains in our diversified alternative platform. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on track. In the first half of this year, we will bring a number of Eaton Vance and Calvert funds onto our international distribution platform. We are also now offering MSIM model portfolios on the E*TRADE platform, and we are seeing positive traction. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets were essentially flat to the prior quarter at $472 billion. We adopted SA-CCR on December 1, resulting in a $23 billion RWA increase. This was offset by a decline in activity and lower market levels towards the end of the quarter. Our SA-CCR mitigation efforts were better than we anticipated and resulted in an impact lower than our initial guidance to produce a better outcome. We repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of common stock during the quarter. We remain well capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR, and our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%, flat to the prior quarter. Our tax rate was 23.1% for the full year. And absent any changes to tax law, we expect our 2022 tax rate to be in line with 2021. We which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. In terms of our outlook for calendar year 2022, the exit rate of our Wealth and Investment Management asset base and the integrations of our acquisitions set these businesses up to further support results. As it relates to institutional securities, while it remains difficult to forecast this business, the banking pipeline looks healthy and the year has started off well. That said, a lot will depend on monetary and fiscal policy and its impact on sentiment.  With that, we will now open the line up for questions. If I can also add to it, Christian, I would just say if you actually look at the data, is relatively, as James said, balanced across many of these different sectors. But as you think of just the advisor channel, you're seeing not only -- we've, I think, spent a lot of time speaking to the community around assets held away. We are seeing existing clients bringing assets as well as new clients bringing assets to the advisor-led channel. So you are seeing a balance of both. Yes. I think we have managed expenses well. I think that we always are cognizant of the pressures around expenses, both on the wage side and on the non-comp side. If you think about the comp side, I think we constantly feel that we've paid for performance, and that's sort of been the model that we have. But as you also think about the non-comps, we're investing in our integration. We're investing in technology, resiliency, cyber. And I think we're also putting in place different types of investments as you think about positioning Morgan Stanley up for growth and making sure that we have the right people and the processes in place to do that. But there is also inherent operating margin in -- or excuse me, operating leverage in the model, and that's been something that we've been able to demonstrate, I think, this quarter as well as over the course of the year. Absolutely. So this $200 million, what we're reflecting here, Brennan, it's a good question, is the forward curve. And so the forward curve has the first rate hike in effect that we looked at from December 31. So that's in the second quarter. So therefore, it's the amount that you would expect to realize this year, should that forward curve play out. That's the way this slide was illustrated. And just to drive the distinction, though, between what you see in the Q, the Q has all different types of waivers. It's not just money market waivers. But you're right to say that this number on a relative basis would be considered low if you're thinking about a full year context. No, you're not. Thank you for clarifying that. That's 100% accurate. What we were referring to is the first quarter of 2022 and using this full year number as a good launching off point is sort of setting you up. That's obviously ex-integration for the first quarter. So yes, as the rate rises, that should increase the margin as it goes forward throughout the course of the year. Sure. Don't worry, Brennan. It's the fourth quarter. Those -- you see some of the rates moving up in the fourth quarter, Brennan. But overall, I think as you look forward and you think about fees more broadly, we obviously have a larger asset base. I think it all ends back to this idea of growth. And that's -- I think, really ties to James' slide as well, which really thinks about what are we trying to build, leaning into growth and really thinking about creating durable fee revenue streams over time. No. Yes. And we also disclosed them in the Q and in the K. Sure. Why don't I take the last one first, which I think the overarching theme is really around adaptation? As it specifically relates to SA-CCR, I think there was data mitigation that we were able to achieve. And I think we're proud of being able to focus and move forward. As it relates to Basel, no surprise that you asked the question, Steve. So it's nice to hear from you on that one. But obviously, there is no final rule yet. I think there's -- the difficulty in saying something is that there's often and can be offset between these rules. And so that's something that I would bear in mind as you think through it and as we all think through it. But what I think is really the point is that we have adopted really well. And we also have 280 basis points, I think, as James showed, of excess capital on the CET1 metric. And so I think we're really comfortable with our position, and we're comfortable to better understand the capital rules as they come our way. Sure. I would actually point to the fact that what I said, I think, in the last 2 quarters, is that we're seeing a broadening out of the advisor activity. It's not specific to any one sector. And I think that's been what's really contributed to the healthy pipelines in that business. across all the Investment Banking. And then as you look in sales and trading, it's a highly diversified model and has not really pinned down to any one specific sector. Sure. I think the -- if you think about the industry wallet, -- There have been a couple of things that I would mention. One is, obviously, as I said, if you look specifically at Investment Banking, you've seen different types of activity. You see different types of corporates and sponsors, which has been one of the contributors of a greater wallet. But then if you also think about the Sales & Trading franchise and the movement there, the activity has changed. I think that you were looking back -- if you think back to pre-2018, '17, '19, there was obviously less activity with central banks all having a very similar approach and one rate. Obviously, as you inject rates rising, you do -- you would expect or one should expect different types of volatility and different diversification amongst products, which could contribute to a bigger or a different type of wallet that you saw in the early 2020 to period. That being said, I mean, obviously, none of us have a crystal ball. I think right now, what we do know is that activity is high. I think there's a lot of client differentiation and a robustness really in that type of wallet more broadly. But we'll have to see how it goes. And I think the point I was trying to make in my conclusion is we don't know how any of it will impact sentiment. And I think that's the big piece that is out there is a factor that we have to watch. So I think that when you -- what we would point to is I think this is a really -- it's a scale-driven model. We've put a lot of moats in place. I think having a global reach across different pieces contributes to the ability to actually hold or gain share across the Investment Banking division and -- or excuse me, the Institutional Securities franchise more broadly. If you think about the equities, we have a very strong very strong franchise there. Investment banking, as I've said before, we continue to invest in that business. And then if you look at fixed income, I think we continue to feel good about that business, our client positioning, and we've gained share over the last couple of years, and we feel good about being rightsized and there for our clients as it relates to those needs. So why don't I start on the integration. I think where we -- what we had said was we looked for approximately a 3-year integration period. We have seen some -- and this is specific to E*TRADE, we have seen obviously a portion of the integration-related spend over the course of the last 2 years. We would expect the vast majority of the integration-related expenses to be pulled forward into 2022 with a slight residual in 2023 but most of that happening in 2022. And I think that what you'll see later in the 2023 space will be more on the back end and not really a client -- not really client-facing. As it relates to the actual cost synergies that we've seen, we're in a very good place. I think that it's exceeded our expectations in terms of the guidance that we gave in terms of a time line and seeing those come through. But on a holistic basis, we stick to the cost synergy guidance that we gave when we first announced the transaction. Sure. So on the first -- on the new metric, I think that the first driver you're going to see is a lot of the companion accounts, right? So we've talked about the fact that we would expect to give everybody on the U.S., a companion account or at least be at 90% by the end of this year, and that's still on track. And what that will allow for is as those assets from stock plans vest into a companion account, you retain them in a Morgan Stanley self-directed type of way.  And then you use -- this will lead to the second question that you asked and sort of tying it together, products like LeadIQ or technology investments like [Project Genome] to better understand our clients and offer us the technology and that agility to give advisors and to provide the right advisors to the right workplace participants. We are already doing that. We already have pilots in place where we are giving different workplace individual advisors. And so I would say that this -- the first step is really getting everybody a companion account and that's part of the integration process. And then the second part is using technology to better match clients such that, while they still get client choice, we're able to offer them the full advice network that Morgan Stanley has to offer. Does it -- no, this is a longer-term target. I think you saw it even this year. So I would just retort with look at this particular year and where we were in terms of our CET1 and, obviously, say we were able to do it given the market circumstance. I'd say that over time, however, we continue to look at capital. As we think about how do we best use that capital for investment, returning it to shareholders with dividends, looking at buybacks and then other ways and uses of capital as we have over the course of the last decade. Sure. So I think that the fee waiver sort of speak for themselves, and so I think that gives you a direct number. On the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance integration -- or excuse me, the Investment Management and the Eaton Vance integration, I think that the way to think about it is it wasn't ever a cost savings transaction. The idea was always to marry the platforms, and you've already begun to see that. So if you think about the diversification of the product suite itself, you're in a position where if you see flows in one business go down, you've seen flows go up in other businesses. And so that's given you this ballast almost in that business specifically. But in addition to that, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, if you look at the second thing that we had highlighted a lot when we purchased Eaton Vance was the different distribution networks. So we have an international -- or Morgan Stanley had an international distribution capability that Eaton Vance didn't have. So a product such as Calvert, where you have a cyclical tailwind in terms of -- and a secular tailwind in terms of people being interested in that sustainability space, that is going to be sold using our international distribution channels beginning in the first half of year. I think that shows the progress and momentum that we have in place as you're marrying those 2 different sort of companies and they're coming together as one. Well, Parametric was already offered and very well received within the Wealth Management platform. I think we're looking for more ways to sell -- to offer that product, I should say, within different parts of the Wealth Management channel."

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding Forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. It was an exceptional third quarter this -- the firm delivered, and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of 45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full-year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage. Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns, and strong operating leverage, and we produced an ROTCE of over 20%, both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Institutional Securities continues to gain share, it performed strongly across all regions and all 3 major businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across the Investment Bank is clearly paying dividends. Of note, investment banking had its best quarter in history. And within that M&A also produced its own record quarter. Equities were extremely strong and fixed income was stable. The wealth management business, which includes E*TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far beyond what we've seen. Through the first nine months, this business added over 300 billion of net new assets, compounding growth on a client asset base of over 4.6 trillion, and we believe this is going to be an economic engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come. The majority of our advisors had positive net new assets year-to-date. And it's this broad-based strength that's key to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and workplace. Self-directed client engagement remains elevated, US corporate soft claim wins increased over 90% versus last year. In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now have in excess of 14 million unique relationships. While it's early days, we believe that over time, Morgan Stanley at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader Wealth Management services.  Investment Management. Fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way, that's nearly tripled the average quarterly level of five years ago. At $1.5 trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of bay we can provide clients. Expanded solutions and customization, sustainability, and value-added Fixed Income, along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform, position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date net flows within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion. Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back 3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan, and doubled our dividends, thereby delivering shareholders a nearly 3% return. All that said, we're not complacent in what is obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment. We do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon, and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. We remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we will exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way. A final word on capital. As you know, SA-CCR, the Standardized Counterparty Credit Risk, regulatory changes beginning next year for the largest banks, It impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risks and thus, risk-weighted assets. We've decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs and with that lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1 ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of the third quarter is 16%. The pro forma impact of CECA, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120 basis points. Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in the future which may itself offset a part of this impact over time. I am now going to turn the call over to Sharon and discuss -- she will discuss the quarter in greater detail and then we'll both take your questions. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again, representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continue to power performance with particular strength in investment banking and equities. Wealth management and investment management each set year-to-date records. While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5 billion in revenues. Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. B balance revenues supported overall results. Advisory, in particular, was a standout with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly, Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pretax margin, which was 38% year-to-date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year. Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarter's results. The Americas and Europe led the year-over-year increase. Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year. Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter at/or above this level. The increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in non-investment grade loans supported by the combination of the rate environment, and elevated levels of event-driven activity. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. And activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth. Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our equities business remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activities throughout the quarter. Revenues in Asia were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint. Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued through the summer months. Prime brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels. Fixed Income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third quarter. Micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues and securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year, which benefited from a wider bid-offer spread. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. Commodities were strong and revenues improved versus the prior year, as North America's power and gas benefited from robust client activity. Turning to Wealth Management, the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period, given the acquisition of E-TRADE, Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%. Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the margin was 27.7%. We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets, which underscores the power of the asset gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced, inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients, stock and investing events, and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA exceeds $300 billion representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets, and fee-based flows. We are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets, who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools, delivered through the financial wellness platform. Deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to an advisor, lead, or self-directed clients based on their individual needs. It's at the core of our expansion strategy. The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel, that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by the momentum in the workplace. Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have nearly $500 billion in invested assets. In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4% in line with seasonal patterns. Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately $960,000 in the Quarter. In line with the average level for the full year of 2020. While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year, client engagement remains high. Darts this quarter was 3 times above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition record. Asset Management revenues were $3.6, billion up 5% sequentially, Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29% to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flow supports our view that clients first consolidate assets onto our platform and then migrate these assets to the advisory. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase, reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation. Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter, but it did impact the sequential move. Excluding prepaying for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter. The integration of E*TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose to provide their Morgan Stanley advisor with visibility into their E*TRADE accounts. By year-end, clients will be able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on building on our digital client experience. Moving to investment management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion declining 15%, while asset management and related fees rose sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue. Total AUM remains strong at $1.5 trillion. Net -- total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter, driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager. The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us. We expect the remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022, as the asset manager brings its equity, trading implementation in-house. Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows, with continued demand for parametric, customized portfolios, private real estate, and private credit, and sustainable strategies through both Calvert and funds. Asset management and related fees were $1.5 billion, reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business, primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helped mitigate this overall impact. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas, particularly sustainability, alternative, and customization for Wealth Management platforms and clients. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $11 billion, primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%. As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SA-CCR during the fourth quarter this year, after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics, such as the future SCB calculations. With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately 35 to $45 billion. This would also apply a reduction to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts that should offset some of the impacts to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well-capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR. We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing. We're capturing share and Institutional Securities. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy. We are excited by the momentum we've seen in Wealth Management's ability to attract and consolidate assets, and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious. The flows in the Wealth Management channel continue to impress. I think you guys are by far the largest distributor of alternative assets, and as that space grows and as that becomes a bigger part of a client portfolio, I wonder if you could help us frame -- have you ever broken out either the asset level or percentage of high net worth portfolios that you have today versus where you think that can grow to?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think. Hi Glenn. It's Sharon. I think if memory serves me, there was a strategy deck that we did in 2017 or '18 that does give a portfolio mix that you can see for advisory lead assets. So it can give you some sense, rough sense from those documents. What I would say though is that I had also noticed this trend. When we go through it, there has been a slight shift. But you're obviously talking about a very large asset base. But I would definitely say that both anecdotally, and it does bear out in some of the numbers that you see a slight increase towards alternatives as a composition of the portfolio.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on your SA-CCR comments, because they were reasonably comprehensive. Which specific assets are most impacted? Just so I can think through mitigation and how much of an impact it can make. And then I'm curious, what does early adoption do for you besides brownie points, like. how does that possibly help in future SA - CCRs?\nJames Gorman: Glenn, in case you're confused, this is James. The accents are so different. On SA - CCR -- I mean, it depicts counterparty credit risks, there were models that were in place, that Basel has been working on replacing. They actually started in 2014. And the idea was to implement it in 2017. And they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin and not margin have to treat that from a risk-weighted asset perspective. So there's a complicated formula that applies the weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment obligations under various contracts. So it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think, during COVID. They've given the banks till the beginning of next year to get -- to put it in place and they are allowing banks to pre-announce the benefit of starting early if it affects the peak-to-trough in your SA-CCR calculations during the SA - CCR cycles. So there will be some offsets later. And we just felt, we need to get -- we needed to get into it sooner rather than later. Most of it is in ISG. I think about if let's say the RWA number, I think we've got at $35 to $45 billion, honestly, that's moving around a little bit because we are -- this is complicated stuff. But we've certainly done the end's worst, and hopefully, it's the lower end of that. Some of it is in the wealth business because of all the options in that business, but it's a relatively small part of it, but I think like 10%, 15%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start on net new assets in Wealth. Sharon, I believe you flagged an acquisition of a retirement business. Number 1, this is basically just the team, right, of consultants that all sit within wealth. So it could be a call to large-scale recruiting. Is that fair? And number 2 is the idea that you guys are interested in getting -- more importantly and more strategically, is the idea that you guys want to get a little more aggressive in 401K, DC plans in order to complement the stock plan business and enhance the workplace offering?\nSharon Yeshaya: I'd say in -- holistically, Brennan, nice question. Thank you. It's fair. I think that it is a large-scale team that you can consider in terms of that asset acquisition. I think that as you rightly point out, it is an extension of our strategy. And what you're really trying to think about is how do you get more participants that you can touch, that you can begin to sell both products and assets that are appropriate for them, but more than that, offer them true services like financial wellness that we're already doing through the stock plan business. If you think of retirement assets and then you think of who is the actual holder of those retirement assets. And those are the participants. So through municipalities, pensions, et cetera, and all of a sudden you have just another layer of people that you first offer, financial wellness and education to. And then you can introduce them to the services that Morgan Stanley has, the same way that you would introduce the services to a workplace client. So an extension of the strategy and a continuation of the concept of the funnel.\nJames Gorman: My key takeaway on -- because this is a very important topic broadly. My key takeaway on it is, we used to have a very monolithic model for asset gathering. You had existing clients who may be brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. You had financial biases about who left and who you're recruited. And for many is, we were frankly net deficit of financial advisors as frankly most of the broker dealer is in my 30 years of doing this. A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. We are seeing net positive attrition, very few advisors leaving and significant advisors come in particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry. So that's positive. The channel that the workplaces opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the driver between -- behind this quarter's numbers is basically a new channel. And then obviously the E*TRADE channel is a new channel, and now you're seeing this sort of acquisition of RIA type teams of which this is one, so it's gone from one model, a defense and a tack model of keep you people and try and get some of the marketplaces to our multi-pronged model, which if we obviously, we can't predict the future, but it looks like this is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead, which is the strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So sticking along that same topic of just the corporate stock plan business, it looks like the organic growth continues to sustain really strong momentum in terms of new corporate stock plan ads. And I was just curious how client conversion levels are tracking today. Within your ecosystem relative to the level as you were seeing prior to the E*TRADE deal. And was hoping you could just provide a broader update, not just on the corporate stock plan momentum, but even just how you're tracking with the revenue synergy targets from E*TRADE s and to announce the deal.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. It's nice to speak to you, Steve. So I would just echo what you said. Yes, we saw US stock plan wins increase by 90% over last year. So just to put that out there and put it in perspective. As you think about conversion, we're still working through some of the metrics as it relates to retention, but anecdotally we are seeing strong retention. Obviously, there were different metrics as you think about what E*TRADE defined as retention and how you might define retention going forward given this new structure. But I think that the synergies as they've played out are very strong. We obviously never gave a direct revenues target. But if you think about what E*TRADE was doing, it's -- the concept was always, well, how you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. And so we're seeing our teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research, et cetera, and advice that you would see through your advisor also through your E*TRADE portal. And all of that's really much interacting on -- we continue to think about meeting our companion accounts for example, which was 50% right now and 90% in the U.S. accounts by next year. So all of those sorts of touchpoints and milestones are on track and we look forward to giving you, I think more detail as you think about the January deck next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBernard Von Gizycki: Yes. Hi. Good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki from Maxim, thanks for taking my question. My question relates to the Investment Banking backdrop and how it relates to direct listings. Investment Banking results are very strong. And as you previously noted, pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions, and momentum should continue. So with that said, there's been a number of direct listings this year versus just 1 in 2018. Given Morgan Stanley has been an advisor on a number of these deals, could you share your observations if the increase of these private to public structures, although small in numbers still have been more of a byproduct of a favorable market backdrop? Or is it more of a structural change in the private markets? And any comments you could share on future industry pipelines for direct listings.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think that key point that we've always said about direct listings is that it's another tool in the toolkit and it's really dependent on the client situation and the needs at that point in time. So these are specific situations, but I would say that that's, while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results, what I would focus you on for advisory are two things. One is the diversification across the sectors and the geography. So what we're seeing is not just one product necessarily driving results, or one sector driving results, but rather that the pipeline broadly is healthy. And as James said, last year, we continue to invest in this business. So I think that's sort of where we -- how we think about the business going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Sharon, James. Can you guys share with us -- obviously, the markets have been very strong. You guys have done a great job, obviously, in capturing that growth along with some of your peers. Do you have any sense of what normal -- what normalization would be in the markets and how you would put -- -- what kind of market share you could maintain in a more normalized market, whether that's somewhere between 2019 and today, but any color there? And then second, James, you talked about increased volatility. What are some of the metrics you're looking at to measure if the markets became more volatile and you guys would maybe get a little more defensive? Thank you.\nJames Gorman: Well, on the normalized markets, it's clearly being a major shift between the U.S. and non-U.S. institutions post-crisis. And I'm talking about capital markets here, Gerard. It's the barriers to entry for those businesses. If you look, a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that tried to be global investment banks and didn't work out so well, the scale economics over the barriers to entry are just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating the global flow of capital markets. And within that, we are obviously performing very well. We've picked up a lot of shares consistently across fixed income and equities, and increasingly in banking over the last several years. I don't see that abating. I mean, I don't see a compelling reason why that would change in the wealth and asset management space, again scale is your friend, we've done two huge deals in the last year and then Smith Barney a decade ago at 6.5- ish trillion, clearly at scale, we're one of the biggest asset managers and Wealth Managers in the world, and that generates about 30 billion revenue. Again, it's hard to pick up advisors one-by-one. And there aren't that many firms out there of the size that really moves the needle on the scale, and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Meritrade deal which combined 2 competitors, you've got Fidelity, you've got a couple of smaller ones, but each was kind of the last big one that was available. So I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. Doesn't mean it can't, I mean, but that would be more internal what we've done to ourselves than external what the market is going to do to us, is my gut on that. On volatility, I mean, you're just -- you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at day-to-day movements in market prices, you're looking at when when the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is, what they start signaling terms of how many DOT suggests there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, 4 to 9. That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around obviously U.S.- China relationships, Taiwan -- injects volatility. Like anything we look at monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics, and then see how that bleeds into market activity. And from that we get -- we sort of dial-up or down on the margin, a risk then you're looking -- you look at specific transactions, you look at multiples of EBITDA the deals are done at. You're looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals. I mean, there's a lot of more tactical stuff. But I try and take a thematic view. My thematic view is, it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues, but it's -- the markets are bouncing a little bit, and over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the Fed starts to move.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJames Gorman: Yes, Mike. Hey.\nMike Mayo: Hey, how are you doing? Look, during the quarter you made what seemed like a pretty significant announcement with a partnership with Microsoft, and I'm not really sure about the ramifications of that. Does it look like you're going to use Microsoft to transition more to the public cloud if I have that correctly? And then you're also going to be providing services to Microsoft to help them position their business, but I wasn't really clear on that. So if you could get -- a dimension that, talk about maybe efficiency benefits by using the cloud, how much do you want to transition your workload to the cloud? And then what is it that you'd be doing in return?\nJames Gorman: It was an important deal. Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest Company in the world. So fantastic partner for us. We did do a multi-year deal with them. I won't give you the financials as you would understand. But a multi-year deal with them, and by the way, they are not the only cloud provider we use. We use -- there are great players in AWS and Google, and we have relationships with all of them, but we wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data, gives us time-to-market tools. There's more resilience and flexibility in the Cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're using to improve our client experience, we do through the Cloud. So it's one of the pillars of our technology strategy. We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in Wealth Management with some of the virtual financial advisors, the lead IQ platform, and the next best ideas, these kinds of things, they are all AI-driven. And I think what you're seeing is with first, the acquisition of Solium, and then an E*Trade, our wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone, and we've been driving a lot of innovation in that space. The Cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one, and I think would just lead to a much more efficient Morgan Stanley and more resilient by the way. But it's not totally -- it's Microsoft, we're very proud of our partnership with them, but we're a huge Company and we're going to keep evolving. We have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that we worked on, that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call, that's between us and Microsoft, but it's a great move, Mike, we're really happy about it.\nMike Mayo: So can you dimension what you think the potential savings are, or how much workload you might move or give us some sense of -- I think what we're finding is some banks like Capital One are 100% on the public cloud. And then there's a series of other banks that don't really want to be on the public cloud. Where are you in that continuum? Do you want to have more of a private cloud or do you want to be one to the public cloud? And what kind of savings do you think you could get?\nJames Gorman: I kind of mentioned savings. Obviously, we're balancing it between both private and public. Capital One is a very different business model. They don't do M&A, they don't underwrite equity deals that have global trading businesses. So, It's really a function of -- you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies. One of the programs Rob Rooney and the team set up several years ago was something we call our distinguished engineers. We have some unbelievably capable engineers, software engineers, computer scientists around the world, who work with us and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm. So no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just, I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a more efficient, more resilient, and faster-moving player. And frankly, being in partnership with Microsoft is a very good thing for Morgan Stanley. They're best-in-class as a Company -- as a tech Company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the advisor trends, you talked about larger advisor groups coming over the recruiting. Could you maybe put some numbers around that in the context of maybe previous periods a year ago, or something prior to that, and maybe the backlog or the outlook for advisor growth as you think about the next 12 month time period?\nJames Gorman: Yeah, we don't -- Dan we don't put out numbers on ATRO teams that we bring in. We have a weekly report which I get every Friday night, about 7:15. And scrutinize that pretty closely and it shows which people we've recruited, what their trailing 12 months revenue are, what their assets are, and then which funds that we lose to different competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. And as I said, I've been doing this a long time at my previous firm, and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisors to RIAs. We're moving this sometimes to private banks. You are losing some of the smaller producers to places like Linsco Private Ledger. That has all turned. And I think the power of the brand, I mean if you're -- the beauty of having this integrated Investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management business is you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisors, world-class whole platforms through infrastructure, means finance, private equity, real estate. But you've also got new issuance. I mean, we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a world-class advisor managing -- some of our advisors have teams of -- they're managing books of 20 and 30 billion. They are enormous operations themselves. So if -- do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets, and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisors plus the research, which we amortized across the cost of all the three platforms, enables us to invest more in research than you do if you were just a wealth shop, or you were just an institutional shop. So again, we don't break down individual teams, but -- and it's more than any total. I have the numbers obviously in front of me. Well not literally in front of me, but in my office. And it's real, we're getting very big teams coming in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nDevin Ryan: Great morning. I want to come back to some of the comments on Investment Banking strength and the expected ongoing momentum there. It feels like a number of the areas are still actually seeing acceleration, even in the third quarter advisory. And so that's driving investor questions around, how much of this is structural versus just being in a great cycle. And as we think about Sharon, some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role. I'm just curious, how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today, relative to maybe a few years ago. Because clearly, that's an area where there's more capital and sponsors are kind of always transacting. So just love to get some sense of how much bigger that is and whether that could continue?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think that if you think about sponsors and -- but if you really think about everything, right? What's gone on is you have cash that you've raised, and debt in other parts of the market, given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic. And so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor, et cetera. And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth be that from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsor's lens. So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business though, and that's the point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. So you might look at a financial sponsor of the sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary, etc. All of that -- -- that pie in terms of where it's coming from, is changing. And that diversification I think is what's helping the activity. And I think that corporations are looking for growth. And so I'd say that it's not just one sleeve that is driving what -- the results that you saw, at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline.\nDevin Ryan: Sure. Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up to your Wealth Management terrific momentum on the lending side. As we think about the evolution here of Morgan Stanley winning a higher percentage of the overall customer's Balance Sheet or their wallet, where do you guys feel like you are at the moment on the liability side relative to the potential? And then are there any other products there that could be the same kind of extension or a focus for growth?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that it continues to be the beginning of that process. And so when you think about where we came from, and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. And so while there is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's a technology that James mentioned that's also in the loan space. So if you are an advisor and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked -- that your client has listed a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You will speak to your client about the product that you might have. And so I think that that extension of how you use technology to service your client better. And then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides a further runway for growth along with that space.\nJames Gorman: And I would just add a few -- when we bought E*TRADE, they had a relatively small loan book, and that was for good reason. I don't know if you remember Devin, but I forget exactly what year was it was probably '05, '06 when they had problems with this large hillock portfolio they had, and that made them very gun-shy about the lending space. So with -- just our mortgage product alone has the enormous capacity with the E*TRADE clients. That's even before you get to start to think about the stock plan clients ultimately. We just think about converting their equity grants into accounts, that's project number 1, but project number two is obviously managing their full liability side as well. So a lot of space to go.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with SocGen. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So crypto has been in the news lately and I just wanted to get your view on how you expect that space to develop and your strategy, and how to offer products to clients. How do you expect to engage with clients in the crypto space?\nJames Gorman: We're not directly trading crypto for retail clients and there are other players who are choosing to do that. We give access to them to buy crypto through various funds and things. But listen. I've said it publicly before, I'll say it again. I don't think crypto's a fad. That doesn't mean it's going to go away. I don't know what the value of -- I don't know what the value of Bitcoin should or shouldn't be, but these things aren't going away and the blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very real and powerful, so it remains Andrew a working space. But for us, honestly, it's just not a huge part of the business demand from our clients. And that may evolve and we'll evolve with it. But right now, it's certainly not what's driving or economics one way or the other. But we're watchful of it, we're respectful and we'll wait and see other regulators handle it.\nAndrew Lim: That was great. Thanks a lot for that.\nJames Gorman: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. It was an exceptional third quarter this -- the firm delivered, and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of 45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues surpassed full-year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage. Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns, and strong operating leverage, and we produced an ROTCE of over 20%, both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Institutional Securities continues to gain share, it performed strongly across all regions and all 3 major businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across the Investment Bank is clearly paying dividends. Of note, investment banking had its best quarter in history. And within that M&A also produced its own record quarter. Equities were extremely strong and fixed income was stable. The wealth management business, which includes E*TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far beyond what we've seen. Through the first nine months, this business added over 300 billion of net new assets, compounding growth on a client asset base of over 4.6 trillion, and we believe this is going to be an economic engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come. The majority of our advisors had positive net new assets year-to-date. And it's this broad-based strength that's key to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and workplace. Self-directed client engagement remains elevated, US corporate soft claim wins increased over 90% versus last year. In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now have in excess of 14 million unique relationships. While it's early days, we believe that over time, Morgan Stanley at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader Wealth Management services.  Investment Management. Fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way, that's nearly tripled the average quarterly level of five years ago. At $1.5 trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of bay we can provide clients. Expanded solutions and customization, sustainability, and value-added Fixed Income, along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform, position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date net flows within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion. Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back 3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan, and doubled our dividends, thereby delivering shareholders a nearly 3% return. All that said, we're not complacent in what is obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment. We do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon, and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. We remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we will exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way. A final word on capital. As you know, SA-CCR, the Standardized Counterparty Credit Risk, regulatory changes beginning next year for the largest banks, It impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risks and thus, risk-weighted assets. We've decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs and with that lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1 ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of the third quarter is 16%. The pro forma impact of CECA, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120 basis points. Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in the future which may itself offset a part of this impact over time. I am now going to turn the call over to Sharon and discuss -- she will discuss the quarter in greater detail and then we'll both take your questions. Thank you. Glenn, in case you're confused, this is James. The accents are so different. On SA - CCR -- I mean, it depicts counterparty credit risks, there were models that were in place, that Basel has been working on replacing. They actually started in 2014. And the idea was to implement it in 2017. And they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin and not margin have to treat that from a risk-weighted asset perspective. So there's a complicated formula that applies the weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment obligations under various contracts. So it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think, during COVID. They've given the banks till the beginning of next year to get -- to put it in place and they are allowing banks to pre-announce the benefit of starting early if it affects the peak-to-trough in your SA-CCR calculations during the SA - CCR cycles. So there will be some offsets later. And we just felt, we need to get -- we needed to get into it sooner rather than later. Most of it is in ISG. I think about if let's say the RWA number, I think we've got at $35 to $45 billion, honestly, that's moving around a little bit because we are -- this is complicated stuff. But we've certainly done the end's worst, and hopefully, it's the lower end of that. Some of it is in the wealth business because of all the options in that business, but it's a relatively small part of it, but I think like 10%, 15%. My key takeaway on -- because this is a very important topic broadly. My key takeaway on it is, we used to have a very monolithic model for asset gathering. You had existing clients who may be brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. You had financial biases about who left and who you're recruited. And for many is, we were frankly net deficit of financial advisors as frankly most of the broker dealer is in my 30 years of doing this. A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. We are seeing net positive attrition, very few advisors leaving and significant advisors come in particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry. So that's positive. The channel that the workplaces opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the driver between -- behind this quarter's numbers is basically a new channel. And then obviously the E*TRADE channel is a new channel, and now you're seeing this sort of acquisition of RIA type teams of which this is one, so it's gone from one model, a defense and a tack model of keep you people and try and get some of the marketplaces to our multi-pronged model, which if we obviously, we can't predict the future, but it looks like this is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead, which is the strategy. Well, on the normalized markets, it's clearly being a major shift between the U.S. and non-U.S. institutions post-crisis. And I'm talking about capital markets here, Gerard. It's the barriers to entry for those businesses. If you look, a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that tried to be global investment banks and didn't work out so well, the scale economics over the barriers to entry are just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating the global flow of capital markets. And within that, we are obviously performing very well. We've picked up a lot of shares consistently across fixed income and equities, and increasingly in banking over the last several years. I don't see that abating. I mean, I don't see a compelling reason why that would change in the wealth and asset management space, again scale is your friend, we've done two huge deals in the last year and then Smith Barney a decade ago at 6.5- ish trillion, clearly at scale, we're one of the biggest asset managers and Wealth Managers in the world, and that generates about 30 billion revenue. Again, it's hard to pick up advisors one-by-one. And there aren't that many firms out there of the size that really moves the needle on the scale, and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Meritrade deal which combined 2 competitors, you've got Fidelity, you've got a couple of smaller ones, but each was kind of the last big one that was available. So I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. Doesn't mean it can't, I mean, but that would be more internal what we've done to ourselves than external what the market is going to do to us, is my gut on that. On volatility, I mean, you're just -- you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at day-to-day movements in market prices, you're looking at when when the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is, what they start signaling terms of how many DOT suggests there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, 4 to 9. That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around obviously U.S.- China relationships, Taiwan -- injects volatility. Like anything we look at monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics, and then see how that bleeds into market activity. And from that we get -- we sort of dial-up or down on the margin, a risk then you're looking -- you look at specific transactions, you look at multiples of EBITDA the deals are done at. You're looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals. I mean, there's a lot of more tactical stuff. But I try and take a thematic view. My thematic view is, it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues, but it's -- the markets are bouncing a little bit, and over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the Fed starts to move. Yes, Mike. Hey. It was an important deal. Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest Company in the world. So fantastic partner for us. We did do a multi-year deal with them. I won't give you the financials as you would understand. But a multi-year deal with them, and by the way, they are not the only cloud provider we use. We use -- there are great players in AWS and Google, and we have relationships with all of them, but we wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data, gives us time-to-market tools. There's more resilience and flexibility in the Cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're using to improve our client experience, we do through the Cloud. So it's one of the pillars of our technology strategy. We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in Wealth Management with some of the virtual financial advisors, the lead IQ platform, and the next best ideas, these kinds of things, they are all AI-driven. And I think what you're seeing is with first, the acquisition of Solium, and then an E*Trade, our wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone, and we've been driving a lot of innovation in that space. The Cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one, and I think would just lead to a much more efficient Morgan Stanley and more resilient by the way. But it's not totally -- it's Microsoft, we're very proud of our partnership with them, but we're a huge Company and we're going to keep evolving. We have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that we worked on, that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call, that's between us and Microsoft, but it's a great move, Mike, we're really happy about it. I kind of mentioned savings. Obviously, we're balancing it between both private and public. Capital One is a very different business model. They don't do M&A, they don't underwrite equity deals that have global trading businesses. So, It's really a function of -- you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies. One of the programs Rob Rooney and the team set up several years ago was something we call our distinguished engineers. We have some unbelievably capable engineers, software engineers, computer scientists around the world, who work with us and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm. So no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just, I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a more efficient, more resilient, and faster-moving player. And frankly, being in partnership with Microsoft is a very good thing for Morgan Stanley. They're best-in-class as a Company -- as a tech Company. Yeah, we don't -- Dan we don't put out numbers on ATRO teams that we bring in. We have a weekly report which I get every Friday night, about 7:15. And scrutinize that pretty closely and it shows which people we've recruited, what their trailing 12 months revenue are, what their assets are, and then which funds that we lose to different competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. And as I said, I've been doing this a long time at my previous firm, and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisors to RIAs. We're moving this sometimes to private banks. You are losing some of the smaller producers to places like Linsco Private Ledger. That has all turned. And I think the power of the brand, I mean if you're -- the beauty of having this integrated Investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management business is you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisors, world-class whole platforms through infrastructure, means finance, private equity, real estate. But you've also got new issuance. I mean, we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a world-class advisor managing -- some of our advisors have teams of -- they're managing books of 20 and 30 billion. They are enormous operations themselves. So if -- do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets, and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisors plus the research, which we amortized across the cost of all the three platforms, enables us to invest more in research than you do if you were just a wealth shop, or you were just an institutional shop.

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again, representing 1 of the top 3 quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%. Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continue to power performance with particular strength in investment banking and equities. Wealth management and investment management each set year-to-date records. While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5 billion in revenues. Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. B balance revenues supported overall results. Advisory, in particular, was a standout with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly, Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pretax margin, which was 38% year-to-date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year. Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarter's results. The Americas and Europe led the year-over-year increase. Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year. Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter at/or above this level. The increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in non-investment grade loans supported by the combination of the rate environment, and elevated levels of event-driven activity. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. And activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth. Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our equities business remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activities throughout the quarter. Revenues in Asia were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint. Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued through the summer months. Prime brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels. Fixed Income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third quarter. Micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues and securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year, which benefited from a wider bid-offer spread. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. Commodities were strong and revenues improved versus the prior year, as North America's power and gas benefited from robust client activity. Turning to Wealth Management, the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period, given the acquisition of E-TRADE, Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However, excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%. Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the margin was 27.7%. We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets, which underscores the power of the asset gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced, inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients, stock and investing events, and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA exceeds $300 billion representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets, and fee-based flows. We are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets, who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools, delivered through the financial wellness platform. Deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to an advisor, lead, or self-directed clients based on their individual needs. It's at the core of our expansion strategy. The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel, that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by the momentum in the workplace. Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have nearly $500 billion in invested assets. In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4% in line with seasonal patterns. Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately $960,000 in the Quarter. In line with the average level for the full year of 2020. While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year, client engagement remains high. Darts this quarter was 3 times above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition record. Asset Management revenues were $3.6, billion up 5% sequentially, Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29% to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flow supports our view that clients first consolidate assets onto our platform and then migrate these assets to the advisory. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase, reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation. Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter, but it did impact the sequential move. Excluding prepaying for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter. The integration of E*TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose to provide their Morgan Stanley advisor with visibility into their E*TRADE accounts. By year-end, clients will be able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on building on our digital client experience. Moving to investment management. The timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion declining 15%, while asset management and related fees rose sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue. Total AUM remains strong at $1.5 trillion. Net -- total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter, driven by liquidity and overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager. The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us. We expect the remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022, as the asset manager brings its equity, trading implementation in-house. Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows, with continued demand for parametric, customized portfolios, private real estate, and private credit, and sustainable strategies through both Calvert and funds. Asset management and related fees were $1.5 billion, reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business, primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helped mitigate this overall impact. Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas, particularly sustainability, alternative, and customization for Wealth Management platforms and clients. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by approximately $11 billion, primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%. As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SA-CCR during the fourth quarter this year, after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics, such as the future SCB calculations. With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately 35 to $45 billion. This would also apply a reduction to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts that should offset some of the impacts to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well-capitalized post the adoption of SA-CCR. We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing. We're capturing share and Institutional Securities. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy. We are excited by the momentum we've seen in Wealth Management's ability to attract and consolidate assets, and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses. With that, we will now open the lineup to questions. I think. Hi Glenn. It's Sharon. I think if memory serves me, there was a strategy deck that we did in 2017 or '18 that does give a portfolio mix that you can see for advisory lead assets. So it can give you some sense, rough sense from those documents. What I would say though is that I had also noticed this trend. When we go through it, there has been a slight shift. But you're obviously talking about a very large asset base. But I would definitely say that both anecdotally, and it does bear out in some of the numbers that you see a slight increase towards alternatives as a composition of the portfolio. I'd say in -- holistically, Brennan, nice question. Thank you. It's fair. I think that it is a large-scale team that you can consider in terms of that asset acquisition. I think that as you rightly point out, it is an extension of our strategy. And what you're really trying to think about is how do you get more participants that you can touch, that you can begin to sell both products and assets that are appropriate for them, but more than that, offer them true services like financial wellness that we're already doing through the stock plan business. If you think of retirement assets and then you think of who is the actual holder of those retirement assets. And those are the participants. So through municipalities, pensions, et cetera, and all of a sudden you have just another layer of people that you first offer, financial wellness and education to. And then you can introduce them to the services that Morgan Stanley has, the same way that you would introduce the services to a workplace client. So an extension of the strategy and a continuation of the concept of the funnel. Sure. It's nice to speak to you, Steve. So I would just echo what you said. Yes, we saw US stock plan wins increase by 90% over last year. So just to put that out there and put it in perspective. As you think about conversion, we're still working through some of the metrics as it relates to retention, but anecdotally we are seeing strong retention. Obviously, there were different metrics as you think about what E*TRADE defined as retention and how you might define retention going forward given this new structure. But I think that the synergies as they've played out are very strong. We obviously never gave a direct revenues target. But if you think about what E*TRADE was doing, it's -- the concept was always, well, how you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. And so we're seeing our teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research, et cetera, and advice that you would see through your advisor also through your E*TRADE portal. And all of that's really much interacting on -- we continue to think about meeting our companion accounts for example, which was 50% right now and 90% in the U.S. accounts by next year. So all of those sorts of touchpoints and milestones are on track and we look forward to giving you, I think more detail as you think about the January deck next year. Sure. I think that key point that we've always said about direct listings is that it's another tool in the toolkit and it's really dependent on the client situation and the needs at that point in time. So these are specific situations, but I would say that that's, while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results, what I would focus you on for advisory are two things. One is the diversification across the sectors and the geography. So what we're seeing is not just one product necessarily driving results, or one sector driving results, but rather that the pipeline broadly is healthy. And as James said, last year, we continue to invest in this business. So I think that's sort of where we -- how we think about the business going forward. Sure. I think that if you think about sponsors and -- but if you really think about everything, right? What's gone on is you have cash that you've raised, and debt in other parts of the market, given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic. And so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor, et cetera. And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth be that from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsor's lens. So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business though, and that's the point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. So you might look at a financial sponsor of the sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary, etc. All of that -- -- that pie in terms of where it's coming from, is changing. And that diversification I think is what's helping the activity. And I think that corporations are looking for growth. And so I'd say that it's not just one sleeve that is driving what -- the results that you saw, at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline. I think that it continues to be the beginning of that process. And so when you think about where we came from, and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. And so while there is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's a technology that James mentioned that's also in the loan space. So if you are an advisor and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked -- that your client has listed a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You will speak to your client about the product that you might have. And so I think that that extension of how you use technology to service your client better. And then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides a further runway for growth along with that space."

During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.  Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release.  This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. As the firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first-half, with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management, and in the first 6 months of the year, we added over $250 billion of net new assets, across both of those businesses.  We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management, and in Investment Management, our assets makes us increasingly diverse and well-positioned, in key secular growth areas, such as customization, private alternatives, and sustainability. Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance.  Equity remains a preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains, and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly. Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our integration.  Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but much more importantly, we're seeing long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement.  This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and year-to-date, we're over 20%. Obviously, we are exceeding our longer-term targets of 17% plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-year, I want to assure you we are as focused on delivering top performance as ever.  Though we're always subject to the broader macroenvironment, we will strive for continued outperformance. Now let me talk about the decision we announced 2 weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to 0, and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share.  Over the past decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grew our dividend from $0.05 ultimately to $0.35, and increased our buyback from 0 to $5 billion. I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment Management contribute durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what we are doing.  As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share, and also increased our buyback for up to $12 billion over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and our performance over the past 3 Federal Reserve stress tests.  These tests confirmed what we have said for many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital, and we have the ability to invest in our business, do acquisitions, maintained a very healthy dividend yield, and increased our buyback.  Given our current earnings momentum, it takes some time to fully distribute that capital, but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start. Now, Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us.  And as you know, Jon took on additional responsibilities, as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1st. Let me turn it over to Sharon, who'll discuss the quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89.  Our ROTCE was 19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our firm which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions. Investing for growth remains a priority, while also managing our expense base. On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which, non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion.  The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E-Trade and Eaton Vance, and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our firm efficiency ratio declined to 67%, excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business.  Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues in investment banking and equities were offset by lower fixed income results.  Underwriting was particularly robust, as issuance remained elevated. And despite lower volatility across asset classes, our sales and trading clients remained engaged. We ended the period on a strong footing, as clients were active through June. Investment banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting.  From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the strongest in over a decade. And while technology and healthcare remain areas of core strength, activity in financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate, and other sectors supported higher revenues.  Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continued to look for strategic opportunities as markets remained open and constructive. Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest on record, and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion.  The increase from the prior year was driven by traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $640 million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth.  Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are number 1 in this business globally. Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased interest in the region from both Asia and non Asia-based clients.  Cash and derivative results were robust, but declined versus the prior year, against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, and increased versus last year, as average balances reached new highs. Fixed income revenues were $1.7 billion. Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products.  This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust, compared to historical averages, but declined from the prior year, as credit markets were relatively range bound, and bid offer spreads compressed. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange, on the back of lower volatility.  Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans, net of related hedges. Prior year results benefited from significant credit spread tightening.  Turning to ISG lending, our allowance for loan -- for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily related to one facility. Total ISG loans were flat.  The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion relative to the prior quarter. Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year, given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion.  Excluding integration-related cost of $60 million, TBT was also a record of $1.7 billion, with a margin of 27.8%. Growth drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to 176 billion which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half.  Net new client, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results. Further, we continue to see strength in net recruiting and retention, also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full-year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business.  Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained high. Self-directed daily average trades were 1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above average levels for full-year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-directed channel.  Asset Management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the amount for the full-year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now 1.7 trillion, or more than double the level of only five years ago.  Bank lending balances grew by a record 10 billion, and balances reached 115 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full-year expectation of 10%. This was driven by strong demand for securities-based lending. Net interest income was $1.3 billion.  Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly. The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve. We have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021.  For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels. The integration of E*TRADE is going well, and we continue to prioritize the client experience.  While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals. The workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are also gaining traction.  We had 4 times as many wins year-over-year. Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis. Revenues were $1.7 billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion and total net flows were over $48 billion.  Since we announced acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increase diversification of this business was a significant driver of results. Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter, and stands at a record high of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion.  The benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter. Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw a particular strength in Alternatives and Solutions, driven primarily by demand for Parametric customized portfolios, as well as a $1 billion strategic multi-asset partnership mandate.  We continue to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms. Loan strategies and fixed income were particularly robust. Asset Management and related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year driven by strong AUM growth and the addition of Eaton Vance. Performance-Based Income and Other revenues were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio.  With the integration on pace, our very strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income, and high-conviction equity investing, positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients. Turning to the balance sheet.  [Indiscernible] assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to $461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET1 requirement, including the SCB of 13.2%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock or 34 million shares.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we're cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, we're starting the third quarter from a position of strength. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy, dialogues are active, and markets are open.  Wealth management continues to retain and attract new clients, new advisors, and new assets. Investment management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform. With that, we will now open the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. You peaked my interest. You made the comments drawn on investing for growth remains a priority. We've seen so much that you've done across Asset Wealth management. My question is on ISG. You're as good as it gets I think in equities and M&A. Where do you see opportunities to invest and/or capture share across ISG right now?\nJames Gorman: Hey, Glenn. I think firstly, I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't, and I'll come back to it in a minute, discount growth opportunities across IM and Wealth, even though we've just done these huge acquisitions. I'll come back to that. In the institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market leader in that.  We will pick up share over time. Clearly in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot of the middle-market M&A spaces are very fertile. There are different parts in the world we still think we could punch higher above our weight.  I actually think both of those, the Equities business as good as it is, and M&A as good as it is, I actually think there's a real upside in both of those. In the Fixed Income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1.25 billion. We raised it to $1.5 billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter with $1.7 billion.  As rates normalize and as the fixed income fee pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of space there in the SVG credit side we've got a world-class business there, again, continuing to grow share. And our commodities business is doing very well.  So, the ISG franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to this quarter it was $7 billion. It was frankly better than we'd expected coming into it, which is terrific, but it's very interesting, that the share gains across -- and it's not just us. Some of the other big players in the U.S. are real and I think enduring.  And as the global economies recover and the people increases, you'll just see more of that. I feel very confident about the ISG business.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. And I hear you loud and clear on Asset and Wealth Management. I do have a quick follow-up. Within Wealth Management, obviously Shareworks is this enormous opportunity. Wonder if you could just give us a little mark-to-market in terms of what's going on in terms of conversions in the core business, and then what is going on in terms of leading towards [Indiscernible] business within the Morgan Stanley platform?\nSharon Yeshaya: I didn't hear the last part of your question, but I think you said referrals throughout and how the integration on workplace is going, Glenn?\nGlenn Schorr: Yes.\nSharon Yeshaya: So the -- I'd say that you're sort of starting with infrastructure, it's going very well, as James said. But the core is start with infrastructure, make sure that everyone has companion accounts as you go through. We've said we're at 50% right now, where clients have companion accounts.  By the back half of next year, we should be around 90%. And we've started pilot programs where you do have that companion account, and we do see it working. We see the retention of assets, we see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice. So we're working with the clients and we're trying out new technologies, and we'll go from there.  So it's really about conversion of clients and then the retention of assets. But it all seems to be working very well.\nJames Gorman: I'd just say something. So I'll tease it a little bit here because it wasn't your question, but you've given me an opportunity to comment based on Shareworks. I think every now and then in business, you look and you sort of see a wave coming, and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing.  The whole workplace space, to me, is the next major growth area in financial services. I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at that Solium transaction, which at the time, some people thought was expensive and it was. I think we spent 800 or 900 on it, might have been Canadian dollars, so somewhere around there, and it was trading at about 500 value.  That gave us the opportunity to do the E*TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients hopefully into being Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE clients as we have the accounts to fold into our own house accounts.  That's one wave. Parametric, the customization space, I think is the second wave. Calvert Funds and everything we've done through our own sustainability and [Indiscernible] efforts, combined with now Calvert 's products.  And then the digitalization and how we're going to take the E*TRADE platform both domestically and internationally, I think there's incredible opportunity. It's pretty rare to sit here, and having done this for a little while, there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business, but these are things where I think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. And I'd like to just start by saying congrats to Sharon. Welcome to the calls in a different role, the quarterly. Dan 's here. Congrats.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you.\nBrennan Hawken: Sure. I'd like to maybe start with the integrations and sort of taking a step back. You've got two pretty substantial deals under your belt. They've now closed and so you're working on integrating those businesses. What are the milestones that we should think about as you proceed with that work? What kind of timeframe should we think about around updates?  Is -- are we going to just get back to the annual strategic update where it's the fourth quarter call or are they going to be more regular updates where we're going to be able to hear about the work that you're doing. James, you made reference to the workplace, which is obviously a key part of E*TRADE.  But how should we think about those from here? I know it's kind of a broad question, but just wanted to try and level this out.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think that it's a fair question. And in terms of where that comes out, it will likely be the next step, will be the annual deck. But then from that point on, I think, there'll be a more regular cadence. Obviously, most investors here know, Jensen for example, who can begin to take us through some of that workplace.  But there is also, I think, the goal will eventually be to better understand where there are participant migration. So how do you think about the question that Glenn asked, which is referrals. How do you see that referral channel going through, in terms of dollars, et cetera.  How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds following through from those Companion accounts. But the integration is a three-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning. So I think right now what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working.  So to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early, I think would also be a mistake because we'd like to ensure that it is the right client experience and that's what we're focused on right now.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, when we think about net new assets, the growth there has been really, pretty impressive. We have seen some acceleration across the industry though, and I think most investors think it's going to slow. This past year has been a little unusual. But when we look at what's been happening at Morgan Stanley, things already were accelerating before we entered into this period.  And so, one of the debates that has been coming up more regularly has been, what is the right growth rate for the wealth business on a go-forward basis? I'll maybe throw out a range. And from my perspective, it feels like somewhere in the mid-upper single-digits, 5% to 7% feels fair on a long run basis. But number 1, I'd love to hear your reaction to that. And then number 2, how do you think about that growth rate?  Do you guys have something in mind? Is there something that you're targeting? Any color on that would be really helpful.\nJames Gorman: I\u2019ll let Sharon start and I\u2019ve got a few thoughts about this.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. I think where we started, Brennan, if we look back to the beginning of the year, we gave you guys a very long historical average chart, and then we showed you the 7% of the pro forma when you included E*TRADE. Now what we have said is we don't think we'd go back to a 3% to4% on a sustainable basis. That 5% to 6% is where James spoke to this audience at the beginning of the year when we talked about the deck.  Obviously as you look forward though, we're doing a lot, both on net asset consolidation, net recruiting, and all of these new channels. And so, I don't think we -- the same way that James level set with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't -- that's probably the same way you can think about this, where 5% to 6% maybe that's the right place to start, but we're obviously not going to try to underachieve that number.\nJames Gorman: Yeah. Brennan, it's really the -- it's the question. Because if we can generate growth in the high teens, I mean, I think we're at -- what are we, 9% year-to-date organic. I mean, this is just -- we've never seen this. And I've been doing this for a very long time. The 3 industry segments, basically the wirehouses, the independent/RIAs, and the direct channel, for years, the direct has grown.  The RIAs have grown in a large part because they've taken - advisers have moved out of the traditional channel, into the RIA channels. So part of the growth has just been a shift, if you will, part of it\u2019s been organic. And the wirehouses have sort of struggled. And it struggled for a couple of reasons : 1 is poor training, 2 is very high attrition, 3 is lack of [gluing] (ph) the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, etc.  And I think what you are seeing now, we think we're kind of creating a, not to be arrogant about it, but a new mouse trap. We're creating an advisor channel, which actually has deep organic growth flavors in it. And if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean they are fantastic.  And with that, we're getting tremendous asset growth. And then you combine that with having the direct platform, and then combine that with having the workplace platform. You've got 3 legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't so long ago that if we did 10 billion a quarter, we thought we're pretty good.  And we just had a $70 billion quarter during tax season, and it's good. It's very good. But we don't think it was a fluke. I don't know where the ultimate number is going to settle. I think our assets in wealth are now around a little over 4.5 trillion. That was 500 billion 12, 14 years ago. We're at 4.5 trillion. We've gone up 9 times.  Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force as you know. I don't know if it's going to -- it won't be below 5%. I mean, in any individual quarter you have stuff going on, but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6, 7, 8, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years but it feels good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. And welcome, Sharon. Nice to have you on the call. Wanted to start off with just a two-parter on Wealth Management NII. You noted that the E*TRADE funding synergies have been captured for 2021. The deposit costs in Wealth Management still feels a bit elevated at 16 bps, especially when benchmarking versus peers.  Just wondering if there's potential to drive those funding costs lower if rates remain at 0? And then just as a second part, maybe just speak to the environmental factors supporting such strong SBL growth and the sustainability of that trend.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I would just mention that we did see the planned runoff right of wholesale deposits. And we continue to expect another 13 billion of wholesale deposits to runoff by year-end, as we see some of that higher cost funding roll down. So just to note there, I don't have an exact target on BDP cost, if that will give you a sense. In addition to that, I would just highlight the SBL question that you asked.  That product is resonating with our clients. So that's the point there. And as James has always said, it's a product in which you lend wealthy clients their money back. And this is something that is resonating, it's structured very well. We've historically seen minimal losses and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio.  So from that perspective, I think it's a good product to offer and it's also something that works especially in a season like this where you generally see a lot of that product in tax season. And so there is an elevated number in the second quarter, generally speaking.\nSteven Chubak: Just for my follow-up on capital management, the dividend increase that we saw was much higher than anticipated. Looks like you're now running with the highest dividend yield amongst all of the G-SIBs. I know, James, you had alluded to the improved stress test outcomes, the higher contribution from recurring revenues.  But just remind us of the philosophy around setting the dividend and buyback, and where you're comfortable running on your capital ratios on it through the cycle basis.\nJames Gorman: I mean, there's a lot in that Steve, so it might take a little while. Get yourself a cup of coffee, put your feet up on the stool. Let's just start with -- I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever, unless we go and screw it up, basically. If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses, and the Wealth business, and the fee-based businesses, and Asset Management, they're for real and they're everyday. And they're not 10 million, they're 100 million. You\u2019ve locked in a $25 billion business right from day 1 in the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it will generate very consistent earnings.  And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right, but my view was certainly the wealth business and the fee-based part of the Asset Management business, which is so predictable, we think of it as like a yield stock, and the Investment Banking and Trading Businesses and Capital Markets businesses and some of the carrier businesses in Asset Management we think is like the -- not the other businesses in a growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine, to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera.  We've been carrying a buffer CET1 of over 17%. We have to be, I think, the latest CCAR was around 13.2-ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally, as we've said, 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less than that. But just pretend that 80 basis points, you're at 14. You've got 300+ basis points to play with.  We're generating net income in the first half of this year was 7 billion. Assume we are less than that in the second half, just because who knows. But we're certainly not going to be under 10 billion for the year, and probably not under 12 billion. You're talking about a buyback of 5 --- of 12 billion, a dividend of 5, that gets you to 17. You're generating at least 12.  You're in the hole for 5, but you've got 300 basis points of excess. It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. And we felt as shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream up the predictability of the businesses. So we've got -- we're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be and the vast majority of them, if not all of them, went out of business or merged.  We are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business. So we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile. 14 points, whatever it was, 8 billion in revenue this quarter, a little over 7 of it was institutional, little over 7 of it was wealth and asset management.  So it's exactly what we hoped, this sort of balance. That's the philosophy now. It would take us a bunch of years, unless CCAR changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer. And we're buying the stock back and the stock's over $90. We are very happy buying at this level but at some point, obviously, that gets expensive.  We do think we can do more deals over time, and we'll actively look at that, and we want to keep investing in the business, but the reality is, and this is the ultimate conundrum, we can do all four : buyback, dividend, invest, and acquisitions, and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings and that's not my solution currently. Let's play this out over a few years.  I'm really happy we got the dividend, as we quoted a reset. And we had the authorization from the Board for up to 12 billion, and we'll go hard at that, particularly if the stock were to-- if we saw a big move in the market. But that's how I'm thinking about it, and how the Board's thinking about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBernard Von Gizycki: Hi, good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki on for Matt. My questions are on Investment Management and the inclusion of Eaton Vance. In the last quarter's 10-Q, you noted that certain Eaton Vance products have lower average fee rates than the standalone Morgan Stanley Investment Management platform. I know you made some revisions to the AUM disclosures, and Eaton Vance only had one month of performance in the data in 1Q. Could you just talk about the expectations on fee rate in the combined Asset Management platform as you diversify the product mix?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that that's right. Obviously, that's in some of the overlay products, for example, will have lower fee rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also, if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other gives and takes. But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product, it's creating an ability to service the client more broadly.  So while the overall fee rate might come down as was disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset parts of that on a total basis, right. A rate times volume kind of concept. In particular, you have the Parametric product which we discussed, which is obviously -- has its own secular growth trends, the Calvert product.  And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends, i.e ESG, i.e, what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM. And in addition to that, I think that the fixed income products offered the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to Morgan Stanley.  And so, from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time, and so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio. But our assets should continue to come in.\nBernard Von Gizycki: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just with my follow-up. Again, I know it's just the first full quarter of Eaton Vance just combined on the platform. But just any color you can share about the integration efforts around putting Eaton Vance 's products on your international distribution channel, and then vice versa, putting some of your core products on Eaton Vance 's domestic retail platform? Just trying to get a sense of anything with the net flows showed up.\nSharon Yeshaya: We have -- I'd say we've aligned the sales forces. But as you noted, it has not been that long. We're working through it. I think we see and we expect to invest in the various businesses to deliver the customization for a better client experience, but also open the new workplaces. So not just international, but also as it relates to workplace, etc. So we're still working through that and we should have an update over the course of the rest of the year.\nJames Gorman: But the short answer on the flows is zero of the flows, to my knowledge, are a result of exactly what you just said, putting the Eaton Vance product in international and putting our products through the wholesalers in Eaton Vance. They're terrific teams. There'll be a lot of upside on that going forward, but zero of it has appeared yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, James and Sharon. And just to echo the sentiments, a big congrats to you, Sharon. James, let me ask you a couple of follow-ups on things you've said on prior questions. I think you just said, maybe a couple of questions before, that you mentioned you can do more M&A deals. Just trying to get a sense of what you're thinking there. Is that the doubling down on wealth management, or is it consolidating traditional asset management space as you look to grow [Indiscernible] client assets?\nJames Gorman: Christian, good morning. We've done I think five deals, acquisition since the crisis, and we've had a lot of dispositions, disposals, I guess. TransMontaigne, Hidemar, we spun-off MSCI, obviously. Before this, we spun off Discover, PDT, [Indiscernible] business, FrontPoint, ESOP.  So folks have focused on the acquisition side, but we've also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by somebody else or just [not a] (ph) fit. Now, Asesores in Spain as I remember, Quilter in the UK, European private banking business we sold, etc.  So on the deal side, we've done -- Smith Barney obviously was the big one and Mesa West was the first sort of toe in the water in investment management, then the Solium deal in the workplace space, followed by E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. So all I'm saying is, we don't have big transactions in line of sight at this point in time, but we're a big enough company, we're generating, I don't know, we're running -- run rate, I guess, is 60 billion of revenues this year, 170 plus billion market cap.  Finding the right things to fit in, particularly internationally, and particularly on the digital and technology side is very interesting to us. Now, pricing is always, you've got to be disciplined, but it's something that we're very watchful of, and we're not shy about it. But major transactions are highly unlikely to happen. These are more bolt-ons as they feel right.\nChristian Bolu: Great, thanks. And just a follow-up, you keep mentioning international. I think you said E*TRADE, you want to expand that internationally? Which I don't think I've heard before. And if I remember correctly, in the past, you were always cautious about Wealth Management, international expansion, and maybe you just said you divested Quilter, and E*TRADE [Indiscernible] international businesses post financial crisis.  So, can you just talk more about how you think about international, how you would expand E*TRADE. What's the sort of like vision here?\nJames Gorman: Sure. I'll try and be brief. The International Wealth business is complicated because while the U.S. market is 300 million people and Europe is about 300 million people, Europe is multiple jurisdictions within that, even though its Eurozone. Asia people look at it, so it's some monolith. It's not -- Vietnam is not Indonesia, Malaysia is not Thailand, the Philippines is not Australia, Korea is not China, etc. You've got to -- it's very hard to get scale in these markets, so issue number 1.  Issue number 2, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not diversified traditional financial planning market. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan, compared to the U.S. That's night and day. And thirdly, obviously, know your client, money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about cross-border type money flows. The bar is very high, and we're a conservative institution.  We just are. So my view has been, for a long time that you trade very carefully. You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm because we basically run it out of Miami and New York. So we run it as a region, as succinct from single countries. And you go and we've done it in Hong Kong where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of Hong Kong and Singapore, little bit in Australia, but basically, you go where you have scale.  So the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia and Indonesia. Hence, E*TRADE becomes a very interesting platform for that. Early days that the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally, but that's something I'd be very excited about.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. This is the first call since you announced the partnership with Microsoft to accelerate your cloud development. Can you talk about what you hope to achieve with that with any concrete metrics possible, and ultimately, how much do you expect to have of your processing on the public cloud or a private cloud and otherwise on-premise?\nJames Gorman: Yeah. I don't think I have off the top of my head all of those details, Mike. We do have a major deal with Microsoft, but we're also working with other Cloud providers. I won't name them on the call, but we have a long-term contract we've just done with Microsoft. It's all part of the reimagination of our technology organization.  And it's come through some programs that we put in place internally around Agile and something we called Pace that are basically designed to move this organization into this century, which I think they've done a fantastic job of. We created a group of what we call the Distinguished Engineers.  And interestingly, and people don't think of it this way, but I think we've done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks, maybe in the world, by spending $13 billion on a technology company called E*TRADE, which is basically technology and brand. The Microsoft deal is a very important one, but it's not the whole enchilada for what we're doing with our tech platform.  It's just a necessary step to move a large part of our business into the cloud. And we've got, I think 3 different providers. We just happened to have the largest contract went to Microsoft on this occasion.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then a separate question on culture. I think it was like 6 or 7 years ago, you made some pretty harsh comments on compensation, and people had to take stock and they were all upset, and I guess that was the right move for you and for them. And recently, you made some other tough comments as relates to employees needing to be back in the office. And there's a big debate out there; should you have a hybrid solution? Should people be back in the office? If you work outside the office, you'd be paid less. So perhaps just my question saying, well you were right, whenever that was, 6 or 7 years ago about being -- taking the hard stance short-term for the long-term. Can you elaborate on those comments you made recently?\nJames Gorman: Well, that's certainly not connected, and I think it was 9 years ago, I think it was 2012. We were barely profitable. We cut the dividend to $0.05. We had zero buyback and we had an ROE of about 2%. And somebody asked me in a TV interview, how would I feel about people complaining about their bonuses. And I said what I said at the time. If you don't reward your shareholders at some point, as you've reminded us over the years, Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they picked up their bat and ball and go home. Given we were paying employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap, and they'd be rewarded.  And I'm very, very happy for our employees that that's in fact what's transpired, and the stock has gone from obviously, a very low number to where we are today. The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I, and others sitting in this room, Sharon and Jon, have developed their careers is by being mentored by, and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career. And I don't think you can do that sitting at home by yourself. I think there's a limit to how far as good as the Zoom technology is, how far they can take you. So what I said was, that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by Labor Day. But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for. What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes great sense. There are individuals who have health issues, there are individuals who looking after family members. In past years, we would have said, well, that sort of too bad. Now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple of months to look after a health issue or a family issue, we can manage that. Some people have extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that. So -- but the basic premise and right at the beginning of COVID in February of -- what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked \"How would this end up?\" I think I said that I felt 80% of all employee hours worked, would be done in one of our offices. And that's probably where it's going to end up. Not 100%, but not 0%.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I just had a question around the -- I know you mentioned earlier in terms of a [Indiscernible] around your return 17% plus return outlook early next year. I was wondering if you can talk about, as you think about the next 5 years and just the competitive forces, talk to us in how you're thinking about main -- budgeting some investment spend as it relates to R&D or more experimental-type investments that could allow you to better compete and gain market share?\nJames Gorman: You know, I -- that would take a lot longer than we probably have on this call. Why don't we hold that until we get to the strategy discussion next year because I'd much rather tie budgeting and investment discussions to actual initiatives that were undertaken, rather than just do it in the abstract here, if you don't mind.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassid: Good morning, Sharon and James. Can you guys share with us, you talked about wallet share gains in the ISG Group. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you think you're achieving it. Some of your peers have said the same thing. Is it because of your people or the amount you've invested in technology, your size, or is it some of your competitors are just weaker and have other issues to deal with, which gives you this opening to take wallet share gains?\nSharon Yeshaya: Hi Gerard. It's nice to hear from you. I'd say it's all of the above. But more importantly, I also think that there is something that we've said which is in periods of crisis, which I think you saw over the course of 2020, oftentimes, those that you are closest to from a relationship perspective end up being your closest relationship.  And you are gaining share in that regard. Very similar to what we've talked a lot about on this call about asset consolidation in a wealth management relationship. I think the same goes for the asset -- the relationship consolidation if you think about Institutional Securities. So be that on the equity underwriting, for example, be that in coming to the equity business.  But not forgetting what we've done in fixed income, which is really gained shares since 2015 to be a really credible player in that marketplace. All of those things, I think technology and leveraging technology with the beginning of[MSAT] (ph)in equities moving over to the right places in fixed income where it makes sense, that investment continues. And I think it's helped us gain share as well from, like you said, probably the Europeans and others that have retreated in certain market places.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. Just really a quick follow-up on net interest income in Wealth Management. I just wondered whether in your view we\u2019re sort of asset sustainable base level here and NII should now grow in line with the volumes that are coming through or are there any further moving parts that you expect to affect that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Well, I would say that the fundamental moving part is rates. So if you think about it, obviously, there are certain things where when we look at giving you guidance or presenting a base case, the base case is what's priced into the marketplace. And so we use that as the guide. And that's why I think for this quarter, what we mentioned was the medium part of the curve did move more than I think that most had expected or predicted.  But as you go forward right now, at least for 2020, the build is really going to come from the actual lending which we've talked about, which is a 2020 number as what we've just given you, and we said that that ran around $18 billion for that year. So that's $4billion to $5 billion a quarter, that you can think of for the growth in lending per quarter through the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I have a couple of questions just on the Investment Management and Eaton Vance. Curious, I know you mentioned that you're just integrating the sales forces for the distribution platforms, but curious about which products do you think have the most potential to be sold through the Morgan Stanley distribution on the global side as you look at the Eaton Vance product lineup today. And then within ESG, you have multiple capabilities now with Calvert and what was Legacy Morgan Stanley. How do you think about integrating that more broadly across the Investment Management segment, given the demand you're seeing- we're seeing across the industry for those types of products?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So I would say, sort of, similar to my last answer, which is all of the above, I think all products. But particularly, we've talked a lot about the customization of Parametric. I don't think that's just wealth management, I think that's a workplace product as well over time, so not just an advisor-led product.  Alternatives, private credit is one where I think we've seen an interest and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the wealth management franchises more broadly, not just our own. And as you think about ESG, we had always talked about Eaton Vance and the old [Anthem] (ph) being a \"perfect fit\" in terms of the two. And I think a lot of that came from the distribution and the complementary distribution that you had.  So ESG products and Calvert was an Eaton Vance product with a U.S. domestic sales force. We have a strong international sales force. And obviously, a lot of the interest in the ESG and sustainability products are also coming from Europe and abroad, and so that's where we think that that distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. As the firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first-half, with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment Management, and in the first 6 months of the year, we added over $250 billion of net new assets, across both of those businesses.  We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management, and in Investment Management, our assets makes us increasingly diverse and well-positioned, in key secular growth areas, such as customization, private alternatives, and sustainability. Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance.  Equity remains a preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains, and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly. Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our integration.  Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but much more importantly, we're seeing long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement.  This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and year-to-date, we're over 20%. Obviously, we are exceeding our longer-term targets of 17% plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-year, I want to assure you we are as focused on delivering top performance as ever.  Though we're always subject to the broader macroenvironment, we will strive for continued outperformance. Now let me talk about the decision we announced 2 weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to 0, and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share.  Over the past decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grew our dividend from $0.05 ultimately to $0.35, and increased our buyback from 0 to $5 billion. I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment Management contribute durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what we are doing.  As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share, and also increased our buyback for up to $12 billion over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and our performance over the past 3 Federal Reserve stress tests.  These tests confirmed what we have said for many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital, and we have the ability to invest in our business, do acquisitions, maintained a very healthy dividend yield, and increased our buyback.  Given our current earnings momentum, it takes some time to fully distribute that capital, but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start. Now, Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us.  And as you know, Jon took on additional responsibilities, as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1st. Let me turn it over to Sharon, who'll discuss the quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you. Hey, Glenn. I think firstly, I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't, and I'll come back to it in a minute, discount growth opportunities across IM and Wealth, even though we've just done these huge acquisitions. I'll come back to that. In the institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market leader in that.  We will pick up share over time. Clearly in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot of the middle-market M&A spaces are very fertile. There are different parts in the world we still think we could punch higher above our weight.  I actually think both of those, the Equities business as good as it is, and M&A as good as it is, I actually think there's a real upside in both of those. In the Fixed Income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1.25 billion. We raised it to $1.5 billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter with $1.7 billion.  As rates normalize and as the fixed income fee pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of space there in the SVG credit side we've got a world-class business there, again, continuing to grow share. And our commodities business is doing very well.  So, the ISG franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to this quarter it was $7 billion. It was frankly better than we'd expected coming into it, which is terrific, but it's very interesting, that the share gains across -- and it's not just us. Some of the other big players in the U.S. are real and I think enduring.  And as the global economies recover and the people increases, you'll just see more of that. I feel very confident about the ISG business. I'd just say something. So I'll tease it a little bit here because it wasn't your question, but you've given me an opportunity to comment based on Shareworks. I think every now and then in business, you look and you sort of see a wave coming, and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing.  The whole workplace space, to me, is the next major growth area in financial services. I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at that Solium transaction, which at the time, some people thought was expensive and it was. I think we spent 800 or 900 on it, might have been Canadian dollars, so somewhere around there, and it was trading at about 500 value.  That gave us the opportunity to do the E*TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients hopefully into being Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE clients as we have the accounts to fold into our own house accounts.  That's one wave. Parametric, the customization space, I think is the second wave. Calvert Funds and everything we've done through our own sustainability and [Indiscernible] efforts, combined with now Calvert 's products.  And then the digitalization and how we're going to take the E*TRADE platform both domestically and internationally, I think there's incredible opportunity. It's pretty rare to sit here, and having done this for a little while, there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business, but these are things where I think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting. I'll let Sharon start and I've got a few thoughts about this. Yeah. Brennan, it's really the -- it's the question. Because if we can generate growth in the high teens, I mean, I think we're at -- what are we, 9% year-to-date organic. I mean, this is just -- we've never seen this. And I've been doing this for a very long time. The 3 industry segments, basically the wirehouses, the independent/RIAs, and the direct channel, for years, the direct has grown.  The RIAs have grown in a large part because they've taken - advisers have moved out of the traditional channel, into the RIA channels. So part of the growth has just been a shift, if you will, part of it's been organic. And the wirehouses have sort of struggled. And it struggled for a couple of reasons:1 is poor training, 2 is very high attrition, 3 is lack of [gluing] (ph) the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, etc.  And I think what you are seeing now, we think we're kind of creating a, not to be arrogant about it, but a new mouse trap. We're creating an advisor channel, which actually has deep organic growth flavors in it. And if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean they are fantastic.  And with that, we're getting tremendous asset growth. And then you combine that with having the direct platform, and then combine that with having the workplace platform. You've got 3 legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't so long ago that if we did 10 billion a quarter, we thought we're pretty good.  And we just had a $70 billion quarter during tax season, and it's good. It's very good. But we don't think it was a fluke. I don't know where the ultimate number is going to settle. I think our assets in wealth are now around a little over 4.5 trillion. That was 500 billion 12, 14 years ago. We're at 4.5 trillion. We've gone up 9 times.  Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force as you know. I don't know if it's going to -- it won't be below 5%. I mean, in any individual quarter you have stuff going on, but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6, 7, 8, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years but it feels good. I mean, there's a lot in that Steve, so it might take a little while. Get yourself a cup of coffee, put your feet up on the stool. Let's just start with -- I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever, unless we go and screw it up, basically. If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses, and the Wealth business, and the fee-based businesses, and Asset Management, they're for real and they're everyday. And they're not 10 million, they're 100 million. You've locked in a $25 billion business right from day 1 in the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it will generate very consistent earnings.  And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right, but my view was certainly the wealth business and the fee-based part of the Asset Management business, which is so predictable, we think of it as like a yield stock, and the Investment Banking and Trading Businesses and Capital Markets businesses and some of the carrier businesses in Asset Management we think is like the -- not the other businesses in a growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine, to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera.  We've been carrying a buffer CET1 of over 17%. We have to be, I think, the latest CCAR was around 13.2-ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally, as we've said, 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less than that. But just pretend that 80 basis points, you're at 14. You've got 300+ basis points to play with.  We're generating net income in the first half of this year was 7 billion. Assume we are less than that in the second half, just because who knows. But we're certainly not going to be under 10 billion for the year, and probably not under 12 billion. You're talking about a buyback of 5 --- of 12 billion, a dividend of 5, that gets you to 17. You're generating at least 12.  You're in the hole for 5, but you've got 300 basis points of excess. It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. And we felt as shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream up the predictability of the businesses. So we've got -- we're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be and the vast majority of them, if not all of them, went out of business or merged.  We are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business. So we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile. 14 points, whatever it was, 8 billion in revenue this quarter, a little over 7 of it was institutional, little over 7 of it was wealth and asset management.  So it's exactly what we hoped, this sort of balance. That's the philosophy now. It would take us a bunch of years, unless CCAR changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer. And we're buying the stock back and the stock's over $90. We are very happy buying at this level but at some point, obviously, that gets expensive.  We do think we can do more deals over time, and we'll actively look at that, and we want to keep investing in the business, but the reality is, and this is the ultimate conundrum, we can do all four:buyback, dividend, invest, and acquisitions, and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings and that's not my solution currently. Let's play this out over a few years.  I'm really happy we got the dividend, as we quoted a reset. And we had the authorization from the Board for up to 12 billion, and we'll go hard at that, particularly if the stock were to-- if we saw a big move in the market. But that's how I'm thinking about it, and how the Board's thinking about it. But the short answer on the flows is zero of the flows, to my knowledge, are a result of exactly what you just said, putting the Eaton Vance product in international and putting our products through the wholesalers in Eaton Vance. They're terrific teams. There'll be a lot of upside on that going forward, but zero of it has appeared yet. Christian, good morning. We've done I think five deals, acquisition since the crisis, and we've had a lot of dispositions, disposals, I guess. TransMontaigne, Hidemar, we spun-off MSCI, obviously. Before this, we spun off Discover, PDT, [Indiscernible] business, FrontPoint, ESOP.  So folks have focused on the acquisition side, but we've also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by somebody else or just [not a] (ph) fit. Now, Asesores in Spain as I remember, Quilter in the UK, European private banking business we sold, etc.  So on the deal side, we've done -- Smith Barney obviously was the big one and Mesa West was the first sort of toe in the water in investment management, then the Solium deal in the workplace space, followed by E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. So all I'm saying is, we don't have big transactions in line of sight at this point in time, but we're a big enough company, we're generating, I don't know, we're running -- run rate, I guess, is 60 billion of revenues this year, 170 plus billion market cap.  Finding the right things to fit in, particularly internationally, and particularly on the digital and technology side is very interesting to us. Now, pricing is always, you've got to be disciplined, but it's something that we're very watchful of, and we're not shy about it. But major transactions are highly unlikely to happen. These are more bolt-ons as they feel right. Sure. I'll try and be brief. The International Wealth business is complicated because while the U.S. market is 300 million people and Europe is about 300 million people, Europe is multiple jurisdictions within that, even though its Eurozone. Asia people look at it, so it's some monolith. It's not -- Vietnam is not Indonesia, Malaysia is not Thailand, the Philippines is not Australia, Korea is not China, etc. You've got to -- it's very hard to get scale in these markets, so issue number 1.  Issue number 2, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not diversified traditional financial planning market. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan, compared to the U.S. That's night and day. And thirdly, obviously, know your client, money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about cross-border type money flows. The bar is very high, and we're a conservative institution.  We just are. So my view has been, for a long time that you trade very carefully. You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm because we basically run it out of Miami and New York. So we run it as a region, as succinct from single countries. And you go and we've done it in Hong Kong where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of Hong Kong and Singapore, little bit in Australia, but basically, you go where you have scale.  So the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia and Indonesia. Hence, E*TRADE becomes a very interesting platform for that. Early days that the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally, but that's something I'd be very excited about. Yeah. I don't think I have off the top of my head all of those details, Mike. We do have a major deal with Microsoft, but we're also working with other Cloud providers. I won't name them on the call, but we have a long-term contract we've just done with Microsoft. It's all part of the reimagination of our technology organization.  And it's come through some programs that we put in place internally around Agile and something we called Pace that are basically designed to move this organization into this century, which I think they've done a fantastic job of. We created a group of what we call the Distinguished Engineers.  And interestingly, and people don't think of it this way, but I think we've done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks, maybe in the world, by spending $13 billion on a technology company called E*TRADE, which is basically technology and brand. The Microsoft deal is a very important one, but it's not the whole enchilada for what we're doing with our tech platform.  It's just a necessary step to move a large part of our business into the cloud. And we've got, I think 3 different providers. We just happened to have the largest contract went to Microsoft on this occasion. Well, that's certainly not connected, and I think it was 9 years ago, I think it was 2012. We were barely profitable. We cut the dividend to $0.05. We had zero buyback and we had an ROE of about 2%. And somebody asked me in a TV interview, how would I feel about people complaining about their bonuses. And I said what I said at the time. If you don't reward your shareholders at some point, as you've reminded us over the years, Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they picked up their bat and ball and go home. Given we were paying employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap, and they'd be rewarded.  And I'm very, very happy for our employees that that's in fact what's transpired, and the stock has gone from obviously, a very low number to where we are today. The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I, and others sitting in this room, Sharon and Jon, have developed their careers is by being mentored by, and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career. And I don't think you can do that sitting at home by yourself. I think there's a limit to how far as good as the Zoom technology is, how far they can take you. So what I said was, that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by Labor Day. But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for. What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes great sense. There are individuals who have health issues, there are individuals who looking after family members. In past years, we would have said, well, that sort of too bad. Now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple of months to look after a health issue or a family issue, we can manage that. Some people have extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that. So -- but the basic premise and right at the beginning of COVID in February of -- what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked \"How would this end up?\" I think I said that I felt 80% of all employee hours worked, would be done in one of our offices. And that's probably where it's going to end up. Not 100%, but not 0%. You know, I -- that would take a lot longer than we probably have on this call. Why don't we hold that until we get to the strategy discussion next year because I'd much rather tie budgeting and investment discussions to actual initiatives that were undertaken, rather than just do it in the abstract here, if you don't mind."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing one of the top 3 quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89.  Our ROTCE was 19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our firm which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions. Investing for growth remains a priority, while also managing our expense base. On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which, non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion.  The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of E-Trade and Eaton Vance, and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our firm efficiency ratio declined to 67%, excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business.  Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues in investment banking and equities were offset by lower fixed income results.  Underwriting was particularly robust, as issuance remained elevated. And despite lower volatility across asset classes, our sales and trading clients remained engaged. We ended the period on a strong footing, as clients were active through June. Investment banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting.  From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the strongest in over a decade. And while technology and healthcare remain areas of core strength, activity in financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate, and other sectors supported higher revenues.  Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continued to look for strategic opportunities as markets remained open and constructive. Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest on record, and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion.  The increase from the prior year was driven by traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $640 million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth.  Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are number 1 in this business globally. Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased interest in the region from both Asia and non Asia-based clients.  Cash and derivative results were robust, but declined versus the prior year, against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, and increased versus last year, as average balances reached new highs. Fixed income revenues were $1.7 billion. Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products.  This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust, compared to historical averages, but declined from the prior year, as credit markets were relatively range bound, and bid offer spreads compressed. Macro also declined versus last year, with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange, on the back of lower volatility.  Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans, net of related hedges. Prior year results benefited from significant credit spread tightening.  Turning to ISG lending, our allowance for loan -- for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily related to one facility. Total ISG loans were flat.  The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion relative to the prior quarter. Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year, given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion.  Excluding integration-related cost of $60 million, TBT was also a record of $1.7 billion, with a margin of 27.8%. Growth drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA to 176 billion which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half.  Net new client, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results. Further, we continue to see strength in net recruiting and retention, also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full-year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business.  Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained high. Self-directed daily average trades were 1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above average levels for full-year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-directed channel.  Asset Management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the amount for the full-year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now 1.7 trillion, or more than double the level of only five years ago.  Bank lending balances grew by a record 10 billion, and balances reached 115 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full-year expectation of 10%. This was driven by strong demand for securities-based lending. Net interest income was $1.3 billion.  Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly. The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve. We have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021.  For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels. The integration of E*TRADE is going well, and we continue to prioritize the client experience.  While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals. The workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are also gaining traction.  We had 4 times as many wins year-over-year. Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis. Revenues were $1.7 billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion and total net flows were over $48 billion.  Since we announced acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increase diversification of this business was a significant driver of results. Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter, and stands at a record high of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion.  The benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter. Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw a particular strength in Alternatives and Solutions, driven primarily by demand for Parametric customized portfolios, as well as a $1 billion strategic multi-asset partnership mandate.  We continue to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms. Loan strategies and fixed income were particularly robust. Asset Management and related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year driven by strong AUM growth and the addition of Eaton Vance. Performance-Based Income and Other revenues were $284 million in the quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio.  With the integration on pace, our very strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income, and high-conviction equity investing, positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients. Turning to the balance sheet.  [Indiscernible] assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to $461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET1 requirement, including the SCB of 13.2%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of common stock or 34 million shares.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we're cognizant of the typical summer slowdown, we're starting the third quarter from a position of strength. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy, dialogues are active, and markets are open.  Wealth management continues to retain and attract new clients, new advisors, and new assets. Investment management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform. With that, we will now open the line to questions. I didn't hear the last part of your question, but I think you said referrals throughout and how the integration on workplace is going, Glenn? So the -- I'd say that you're sort of starting with infrastructure, it's going very well, as James said. But the core is start with infrastructure, make sure that everyone has companion accounts as you go through. We've said we're at 50% right now, where clients have companion accounts.  By the back half of next year, we should be around 90%. And we've started pilot programs where you do have that companion account, and we do see it working. We see the retention of assets, we see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice. So we're working with the clients and we're trying out new technologies, and we'll go from there.  So it's really about conversion of clients and then the retention of assets. But it all seems to be working very well. Thank you. Sure. I think that it's a fair question. And in terms of where that comes out, it will likely be the next step, will be the annual deck. But then from that point on, I think, there'll be a more regular cadence. Obviously, most investors here know, Jensen for example, who can begin to take us through some of that workplace.  But there is also, I think, the goal will eventually be to better understand where there are participant migration. So how do you think about the question that Glenn asked, which is referrals. How do you see that referral channel going through, in terms of dollars, et cetera.  How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds following through from those Companion accounts. But the integration is a three-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning. So I think right now what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working.  So to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early, I think would also be a mistake because we'd like to ensure that it is the right client experience and that's what we're focused on right now. Yeah. I think where we started, Brennan, if we look back to the beginning of the year, we gave you guys a very long historical average chart, and then we showed you the 7% of the pro forma when you included E*TRADE. Now what we have said is we don't think we'd go back to a 3% to4% on a sustainable basis. That 5% to 6% is where James spoke to this audience at the beginning of the year when we talked about the deck.  Obviously as you look forward though, we're doing a lot, both on net asset consolidation, net recruiting, and all of these new channels. And so, I don't think we -- the same way that James level set with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't -- that's probably the same way you can think about this, where 5% to 6% maybe that's the right place to start, but we're obviously not going to try to underachieve that number. Sure. I would just mention that we did see the planned runoff right of wholesale deposits. And we continue to expect another 13 billion of wholesale deposits to runoff by year-end, as we see some of that higher cost funding roll down. So just to note there, I don't have an exact target on BDP cost, if that will give you a sense. In addition to that, I would just highlight the SBL question that you asked.  That product is resonating with our clients. So that's the point there. And as James has always said, it's a product in which you lend wealthy clients their money back. And this is something that is resonating, it's structured very well. We've historically seen minimal losses and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio.  So from that perspective, I think it's a good product to offer and it's also something that works especially in a season like this where you generally see a lot of that product in tax season. And so there is an elevated number in the second quarter, generally speaking. I think that that's right. Obviously, that's in some of the overlay products, for example, will have lower fee rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also, if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other gives and takes. But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product, it's creating an ability to service the client more broadly.  So while the overall fee rate might come down as was disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset parts of that on a total basis, right. A rate times volume kind of concept. In particular, you have the Parametric product which we discussed, which is obviously -- has its own secular growth trends, the Calvert product.  And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends, i.e ESG, i.e, what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM. And in addition to that, I think that the fixed income products offered the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to Morgan Stanley.  And so, from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time, and so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio. But our assets should continue to come in. We have -- I'd say we've aligned the sales forces. But as you noted, it has not been that long. We're working through it. I think we see and we expect to invest in the various businesses to deliver the customization for a better client experience, but also open the new workplaces. So not just international, but also as it relates to workplace, etc. So we're still working through that and we should have an update over the course of the rest of the year. Hi Gerard. It's nice to hear from you. I'd say it's all of the above. But more importantly, I also think that there is something that we've said which is in periods of crisis, which I think you saw over the course of 2020, oftentimes, those that you are closest to from a relationship perspective end up being your closest relationship.  And you are gaining share in that regard. Very similar to what we've talked a lot about on this call about asset consolidation in a wealth management relationship. I think the same goes for the asset -- the relationship consolidation if you think about Institutional Securities. So be that on the equity underwriting, for example, be that in coming to the equity business.  But not forgetting what we've done in fixed income, which is really gained shares since 2015 to be a really credible player in that marketplace. All of those things, I think technology and leveraging technology with the beginning of[MSAT] (ph)in equities moving over to the right places in fixed income where it makes sense, that investment continues. And I think it's helped us gain share as well from, like you said, probably the Europeans and others that have retreated in certain market places. Well, I would say that the fundamental moving part is rates. So if you think about it, obviously, there are certain things where when we look at giving you guidance or presenting a base case, the base case is what's priced into the marketplace. And so we use that as the guide. And that's why I think for this quarter, what we mentioned was the medium part of the curve did move more than I think that most had expected or predicted.  But as you go forward right now, at least for 2020, the build is really going to come from the actual lending which we've talked about, which is a 2020 number as what we've just given you, and we said that that ran around $18 billion for that year. So that's $4billion to $5 billion a quarter, that you can think of for the growth in lending per quarter through the end of the year. Sure. So I would say, sort of, similar to my last answer, which is all of the above, I think all products. But particularly, we've talked a lot about the customization of Parametric. I don't think that's just wealth management, I think that's a workplace product as well over time, so not just an advisor-led product.  Alternatives, private credit is one where I think we've seen an interest and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the wealth management franchises more broadly, not just our own. And as you think about ESG, we had always talked about Eaton Vance and the old [Anthem] (ph) being a \"perfect fit\" in terms of the two. And I think a lot of that came from the distribution and the complementary distribution that you had.  So ESG products and Calvert was an Eaton Vance product with a U.S. domestic sales force. We have a strong international sales force. And obviously, a lot of the interest in the ESG and sustainability products are also coming from Europe and abroad, and so that's where we think that that distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere."

Today's presentation will refer to Morgan Stanley's earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs; numerous performance records; the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year; and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund, Archegos. In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represented annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pre-tax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years, and we expect will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record, with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE, and particularly the strength of the self-directed channel, has exceeded our expectations. In addition, assets continue to migrate towards advice. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans, and as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1 million. Institutional securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade, and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment banking revenues reached a record, driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade. Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together two high-performing assets managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion, and pro forma net flows were approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%. Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination, and increasingly recognized the highly differentiated value offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion, and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments. Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales, culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions, which are not especially problematic, might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible, and in so doing incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation. Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations. And as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing wealth and investment management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the firm this quarter. We are more convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together we'll take your questions.\nJonathan Pruzan: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced record revenues of $15.7 billion in the first quarter. Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 66%. First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and three years' restated data on pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. The more significant items are as follows. For the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses. In Institutional Securities, sales and trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses. And other revenues, notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges, as well as the impact of deferred compensation plans. And in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into two lines. Asset Management has been renamed Asset Management and Related Fees, although the historical numbers remain the same. And we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named, Performance-Based Income and Other, notably carried interest. We have also updated our AUM disclosures, Alternatives and Other has been updated to Alternatives and Solutions, to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called Liquidity and Overlay Services. Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back-half of 2020 continued as clients remained high engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex. Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the four best quarters of the last decade, in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues of $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year, driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflect its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong, with blocks, follow-ons, and convertibles also notable. Fixed income underwriting revenues, of $631 million, were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year, as companies continue to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across non-investment grade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active. Equity markets should support issuance, and conditions remain favorable for borrowers. And we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and healthcare. Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade, as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in the decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and Prime Brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher Prime Brokerage balances respectively were offset by the losses James discussed. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus, and the movement in passive rate supported client activity. Micro performance continues to be strong. A meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust that were reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid-ask spread were more stable this period. And commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $323 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-mark losses on corporate loans and related hedges. Turning to ISG lending, our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and pay downs on corporate relationship loans particularly non-invest grade resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million. And our allowance for credit losses on ISG and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans in lending commitment. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment grade clients that were largely offset by pay downs. Approximately 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million. Turning to wealth management, given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter revenue increased 11%. Integration related expenses were $64 million. And excluding these cost, pre-tax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion. And the PBT margin was 27.9%. The underlying growth drivers in this business remained extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisors also recognized the value of our platform demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention which also benefited M&A. Elevated client activity across both advisor-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust reflecting record net buying activity. Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of $1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of $1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E*TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin. Asset management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior six years and revenues were up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities based lending led the quarterly balance sheet of $7 billion, north of the 10% full-year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth. Net interest income was $1.4 billion including prepayment amortization which turned positive, and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6%, and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies, driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, rose in bank lending balances, and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to runoff additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending. We're even more excited about E*TRADE today then when we announced the deal as momentum on E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NII. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year, rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress for their integration. Rest of 2021 will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive datasets, which covered advisor-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisors to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey. Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity plan wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley at work platform. The number of participants now stands at $5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have one, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows. On the expense side, we're on track to realize a $100 million of cost synergies in 2021, and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year. Moving to investment management, on March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which, half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio is impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include one month of the buying businesses, financial, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We're pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcements closed, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and region. We saw a particular strength in MSM global equity strategies, which continue to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and parametrics is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance is leading a floating rate loan business, recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw strong growth as ESG investing accelerates. In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningful increase, and asset management and related fees were $1.1 billion with just one month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds, which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which integration-related expenses were negligible. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels, and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter, at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter, to 16.8. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full-year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, as our three world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring, and less capital intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services within our large customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well-positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops. With that, we will now open the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to ask maybe first on Wealth Management. The net new asset growth rate implying double-digit organic is really impressive, not something that narrative around wirehouses, tailing to be able to grow really jives with. So, I'm curious, I know we've seen these trends accelerate in Morgan Stanley before over a year now. But how much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to E*TRADE versus full-service Wealth Management at Morgan Stanly? And how should we think about a sustainable organic net new asset growth going forward?\nJames Gorman: Well, Brennan, let me have a go at that. I mean historically, the growth rate, as you probably know in the full-service, as you call it, wirehouses has been, I don\u2019t know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years, with loss of financial advisors, some loss of assets into the RAA channel, and clearly loss to some of the direct distributors, and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute. But this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel. We have that through E*TRADE. Number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E*TRADE. Number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are brining in assets, and we're doing that. And number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas which link to our institutional business and the quality research and product. You're just operating at a different level. And so, I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things, E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which again we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%. Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors -- tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualize 10% a year for the next several years that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, is just -- it's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there.\nBrennan Hawken: No doubt. Thanks for that color, James. And then thinking about NII within the Wealth Management business, Jon, you made some comments on NII, but I wasn't sure if those were just purely on the wealth and from wide. When we think about it on the Wealth Management business, thanks for quantifying those prepaid impact, is this -- you've got strong loan growth. We've got securities yields that have been recovering, yesterday's setback aside. So, should we be expecting continued constructive trends in core NII ex-ing out any noise you might have from prepays quarter-to-quarter?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. I think the short answer is, yes. We've really got some nice tailwinds from the loan growth that we've been experiencing, as well as the deposit funding synergies. I think, as I said in the first quarter, we don't expect any movement in policy rates. The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits, which as you know, was feathered in over the quarter, and so that, we'll have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So, we feel good about the guidance we gave you. The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate, and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the wealth management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nJames Gorman: Morning.\nSteven Chubak: So, wanted to start off with a question on the Archegos development. So, James, you noted that you were pleased with how the firm responded just given the complexity of the situation. What were some of the learnings from that experience? And just maybe more importantly, how does it inform your risk management approach within PB to infer that you can avert a similar situation in the future?\nJames Gorman: Yes, I think -- I mean, my comment about the way this team has worked together now for a decade. We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job or level below where we are now. So, I'd say, the accumulated, both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy; we cauterize bad stuff, and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office actually, no outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in their single stock position, very concentrated single stock loan positions that had exposed to growth. And they're offset by the various shorts, in the indices that they were short. So, it was -- and I think what -- the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. But it's not going to change how we feel about the Prime Brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So, it doesn't change that at all. But I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type relationships, where they're very concentrated, and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. Better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be. So, obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it. But we're -- as I said, we've never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter-end, we didn't want this thing to be lingering.\nSteven Chubak: No, that's helpful color, James, and certainly appreciate your candor on the topic. Just for my follow-up, another one on NII, Jon. I just wanted to get a sense, looking at the cost of deposit disclosure, nice to see that come in from 24 bps to 18 basis points. And one of the things that we're thinking about just given some of the funding benefits from E*TRADE as well as just some higher-cost wholesale deposits that start to roll off. Where should we expect that number to ultimately bottom? And is that what informs those benefits, at least your expectation that we should be able to grow or build an NII from here going forward?\nJonathan Pruzan: So the weighted average cost of deposits is 18. It will clearly continue to tick down over the course of the quarter, assuming short-term rates don't move. And again, we're not expecting policy rates to move as the wholesale higher cost wholesale deposits roll off. I think, as you recall, when we originally announced the transaction, I think we talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the growth in deposits. You said that we would realize that in $200 billion of which will be realized this year. So we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022. So, all of the sorts of a movement, if you will, in the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our funding synergy calculation. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move. So there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates and NII will grow because the quantum will grow based on loan growth. And then we pick up the funding soon.\nSteven Chubak: That's great color, John. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJonathan Pruzan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. James, I think you've covered some of the stuff that I wanted to cover on our cases, sort of couple of quick follow-ups. So I still want to get to what was so complex about this one. Is it really just the family office nature and the less disclosure on multiple primes and the leverage of employees where, because obviously what's been great about your PB businesses. I mean, you didn't even lose money in '08, you had the assets, when they historically, when you have the assets and things break, you look for more collateral or you blow out the positions. What was different about this one? What do you think, why wasn't it disclosed? Why didn't this meet the materiality past, and then what do you think regulators want to change going forward? Thanks. Sorry for the follow-ups.\nJames Gorman: Well, going to try and touch on a couple of them. And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter. And so I don't want to spend too much with talking about a specific line situation, which is now done on history, but let me touch on a couple of things going to the reverse, sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. But the business was having a record quarter, the equities business, where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've going to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's frankly, at given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of I don't know 340 quarters that we've had since our origination. So you've got to sort of focus on, on the big picture on that one. What was different about this situation relative to our weight, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had, we went back through the records and I don't think we've ever had this a long time, but a loss in the PB business and the businesses back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now. And we are the number one prime broker in the world. We were the number one prime broker in this particular instance. There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers and as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them, and I'm not the expert on it made it more difficult to understand exactly who was holding, what, where, and that's something that we'll work through and that's part of the learning experience. It was complicated. I will say last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriting; we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting, which happened on that Friday. So, we had to hold off, which caused us to be later than some if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on. We just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So, anyway, it's a long story, but again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. And then on workplace, it's such a good growth and good margin business on its own. How do you execute? You mentioned that the companion accounts over the next 12, 18 months, how do you execute on that and then how you execute on morphing them to the all important Wealth Management Advisory relationship?\nOperator: Please standby. It is disconnected, the call will now end. Goodbye. Please standby. The conference will resume momentarily. Again, please standby. Please standby. The conference will begin now. Otherwise please hold. This line is now muted. I'm passing it to the line. Hold on, I'm passing in.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Hello, this is the speaker of the call. Can the Operator hear us, please?\nOperator: Yes, confirmed.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Okay, great. Can you present, please?\nOperator: You are in the main conference ready to proceed.\nJames Gorman: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning. Hope everyone can hear me.\nJames Gorman: We can now, sorry about that.\nChristian Bolu: Perfect. No worries, okay. Just circle back to the Wealth Management business. The organic growth there was pretty spectacular, north of 10%. And I was wondering if you'd give more detail on the Legacy Fresh advisor business, I hear you on each one of workplace. But the vast majority of the business is still the FA business. And it's really surprising to see this level of growth. So just curious, how much of recruiting for example drive growth, have you made any changes to the recruiting incentives that you're paying out to drive local, just trying to understand some of the core drivers of the strengths here?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure, Christian, it's Jon. I'll take that. I would say just first on net recruiting. I think you've heard us talk about this for the last several quarters, we've been very active, we've become a destination of choice. All the comments that James made about the breadth of the platform, the intellectual capital, the technology investments that we've made have made our platform and our company a place where FAs wants to do business. So we've seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline, as we bring in FAs and they're successful, and they like the platform. They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues, and therefore it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's point number one, in terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made net recruiting aided in the NNA, the E*TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel bringing in existing clients away. So just broad based activity, very, very active, we talked about client engagement being quite spectacular this quarter, and it really aided those numbers but broad based.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thank you. And then to your point, it's been a while since I've seen this level of revenues in that business, and you called out securitized products as a real strength, which I think has always been a bigger business for Morgan Stanley, maybe any more details on that business and what's driving growth. Is it anything to do with the state of the mortgage markets and the strength there, just trying to get more color on sort of, if you have business and what's driving the strong growth there?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. And again, I think that as I said, the Fed business, it was really every business in all geographies contributed to that quarter $3 billion of revenue, the team is working extremely well together, we're gaining share in that business, the depth of the franchise continues to improve, as you can imagine, in this environment, where the debate around rates and inflation and credit yields. So generally speaking, the credit products have been quite active and volumes have been quite elevated. Also, it's being aided by the primary calendar agency issuance. And so just a lot of good activity going on in credit, and I think as you saw, this quarter, a lot of debate around rates inflation, reflation, which really added to those results.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi, well, great timing with your E*TRADE acquisition. And I guess retail volumes are some two to three times high, higher than historical from what I can tell. Are you seeing those trends continue through the end of March? And do you expect that to reverse as we get out of the pandemic and people get out of the house and stop trading as much or maybe this is secular?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure, Mike. No, we're really pleased with the timing of the transaction as you highlight, just if you look at number of clients, volumes, trades, all of the metrics that we historically looked at in that business, they're dramatically higher today than they were when we announced the transaction back in February of last year. So we're also seeing that same engagement across the FA led channel. So it's not just related to the E*TRADE. So I think client engagement is very, very strong at 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average trade in the fourth quarter, which was a record, it was less than a million over the course of last year. So we're clearly at elevated levels. So I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in '19, no. But can we sustain this level? No one's got a crystal ball. But right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged. And we'll have to see how this plays out over time.\nJames Gorman: Mike, I just said the two kickers, there will be some obviously these markets won't state this kind of retail activity forever. But the two strategic kickers behind this business are yet to really have the impact that they will have, obviously, the deposits and as rates rise, that will be a phenomenal additive. And secondly, the whole workplaces we're integrating with Solium. And that's proving we had some stats in there, I think about 5 million plus clients in there. But that's a huge growth business for us. And I think that'll be sort of the story of the next five years, as much as the elevated activity will be.\nMike Mayo: And then my separate question goes back to Archegos, so if I heard you correctly, $900 million of losses and that compares to record equities anyway, $40 billion of revenues over the past decade in prime brokerage. But within all the news around this, I guess it was just press report saying that you didn't have losses. So I think it's a little bit of a surprise, and does speak to risk management. And so I guess my question is, how much of your prime brokerage business relates to family offices, since you're saying you're taking another look at that and why do you think it was that you were the only large bank to call out losses of this magnitude, when others didn't? I mean, did you, I don't know what you guys did differently versus Citibank America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, or maybe they didn't disclose it. I just don't know if you can share some color on that, that would be great.\nJames Gorman: Well, I'll give you a couple of things, just on the -- we're in a quiet period. So those things, there are certain times when you can't comment about the business unless you sort of pre-announce earnings, which we weren't going to do given that it was a record. So secondly, I don't I'm not going to comment on other firms. Some of them weren't even prime brokers to this institution. I don't think so. Each of them have their own bid, and they make it and thirdly, the context is the business is a phenomenal business. It's been risk managed very well. This was a very unusual incident. I think the family office, I don't have those numbers, Jon might have, I suspect it's less than 10% of the prime brokerage business, very small. So, yes, Mike I mean listen, we're quite transparent about this. We don't like to take losses ever. Unfortunately, when you intermediate flows of capital, you sometimes say that's what our whole margin book is. And the question is, once you're faced with the reality, how does the team come together to deal with it? And I think they did. As I said, I think they did a really good job.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. To me first, just on the trading front obviously robust quarter gauging with those losses, I realized it's difficult to gauge the outlook. Could you -- what drivers are you seeing that could continue to drive activity versus normalize it? And how is your market share, you have been trending during in this environment?\nJonathan Pruzan: It's a great question. And again, without the crystal ball, I'll just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw in the first quarter. And then we collectively decide where we think that'll persist for what period of time, we clearly still have strong asset values. I mentioned, we have healthy pipelines and clients are significantly engaged both retail and institutional, markets are open, there's a lot of liquidity. And we're seeing a continuation of the accelerating economic data around the globe. Obviously, news coming out of China this morning or last night in terms of the growth recovery, so really good backdrop or macro backdrop. As James mentioned, seasonality the first quarter is usually the strongest. Typically, it wasn't last year, but typically it is the strongest in these businesses, we're confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year, in terms of our strategic goals. We do believe and I think the data supports that we're gaining market share across all of our businesses. So that's something that we would expect to persist. And I think this year is really going to be focused on that, just growing our market shares and integrating these two very important acquisitions.\nMichael Carrier: Okay, great and then just as a follow-up. Just on the wealth and investment management, organic growth got to be very strong gain dimension, some of the retail activity can moderate. I guess maybe on the flip side, both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, they're very early, it's early innings in terms of integrating it and getting to like the maximum potential. So what are some of those initiatives over the next one to two years did that you feel like, good maybe partially offset any normalization that we eventually get?\nJonathan Pruzan: I think James mentioned a couple of those already. I mean, I think what we've said all along, we're going to be very deliberate with the integrations, these deals were not about costs, they were about growth. And we do not want to, we don't want to disrupt the client experience, we obviously want to enhance it over time. So we're being very deliberate, we're investing in the platforms, we're investing in the service model and we're in the process, as we've mentioned before of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand what we need, so we can service our clients better. So, for example, we're defining running pilots around lead generation. We're defining the FAs, it will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FAs to the client based on specific needs. And the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes, the people and the process to be able to support our clients in the coming year. So we think there's huge potential. James mentioned the 5 million workplace participants were only clients outside of that channel with about half of those, that business continues to grow. The great thing about that business is that it's scalable. Think of it is a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships, that experiences digital. So, it is very, very scalable. And we would expect real growth not only in that channel but to drive growth across the platform, really out of the workplace.\nJames Gorman: Just to add to it, I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these four businesses, the Eaton Vance, our own investment management business, a traditional co-wealth management business in E*TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. I mean, look at the parametric product in Eaton Vance, it's extraordinary. They've done an unbelievable job. Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with solely in there. And now we'll be one of the top two workplace providers in the world, things that we can do to expand internationally and taking Eaton Vance product using our international distribution putting some back core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. So it's just -- there is so many verticals now, which are driving growth. Once upon a time when we had the coal business, that sort of number of financial advisors and productivity per financial buzzer, that's basically the only two metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are bobbing along. So, you know, sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally. They hate that. But you know what, I told Danny [indiscernible] a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform was a trillion dollars assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset. It's not assets. And I said, yes, I know, but I'd like $1 trillion with high revenues per asset, and guess what, we've got $1.4 trillion when we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had 500 being under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to 10 trillion, we've got all these growth verticals and I just couldn't be more excited about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Maybe just a little more color on workplace. I feel like it's a good growth and good margin business on its own, but nirvana is the ability to transition them over to full wealth management advisory relationships over time. So the question is how do you execute on that? You mentioned companion accounts, but do you make research available? What products do you push across? Have you pre-market to them to convert them, because it takes time? Thanks.\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes. Glenn, John is going to answer, but sorry about cutting off the four rows in personal, trust me, I like you, don't know quite what happened, but I told the team, let's get you back on for another go at it, to dub you back.\nJames Gorman: I think you sort of highlighted some of the things that are going to drive the growth going forward. I mean, again, we want more corporate accounts. We're seeing the pipeline very strong. The hit rate is higher and the product is really resonating. We then want to grow the participants. And then once the participants are in the system, we need to build trust and relationships with them through content, through education and through services, because the ultimate goal as you said is to convert them to a broader client. And when we first convert them, we're reasonably indifferent whether they go into the self-directed channel, the FA channel, a virtual channel, because that'll just give us an opportunity to build that relationship, deepen that relationship as the clients requirements and services and needs change, we'll be able to grow with them. And so your comment about migrating wealth client across the different platforms be the ultimate goal, but first we want to build trust with them, bring them into the Morgan Stanley relationship, one of the keys is to try to have that integrated experience across the platforms for the clients. So that's a lot of the technology that we're trying to build too. So we want to bring them in, deepen the relationship and then let them go to the channel that best suits.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, James. I'm very confident in our relationship. I appreciate that.\nJames Gorman: Good to hear.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aijaz Abdul Hussain with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nAijaz Abdul Hussain: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on fixed income, as you know, you are very credit key player. And clearly that's been performing extremely well. I just wanted to see how you're thinking about that business more the longer-term, more stable environment around credit and with you macro pieces being a bit weaker. So can you talk a little bit about the mix and if you're happy about the mix or what opportunities do you see to further grow the rates and FX area?\nJonathan Pruzan: I think that the short answer again is that we're very pleased with the performance from the fixed income business. We've deepened the breadth of the franchise as you said, credit has historically been a strong point for us, but we're seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space. And so again, we think we've gained market share since we've restructured this business. We were probably a 6% or 7% player before. We're now probably a 10%, maybe even 10% plus player. We would expect to maintain that market share going forward, potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more, but we've been very pleased with the balance of the business and the results over the last several years in this.\nAijaz Abdul Hussain:\n,:\nJames Gorman: I'll just make one comment. And I'll let John to add a couple of comments, but we've answered and addressed this topic and I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity to talk about it in the future, but this is a pretty small part of what we do as a whole firm. But I think the comment I want to make is family offices are not bad per se. I want to be very clear about that. We have some phenomenal family office clients, and they're all over the world tremendous institutions. So let's not throw the baby out with about 40 here. This is not a judgment call on family offices. This is a very idiosyncratic event. And I'll let John, if he wants to add anything more to it, but I don't want to overlay with this issue.\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes, I would just and I think just pulling some of the threads of your questions together, just make a couple more observations. First, as we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios. As James mentioned, we're looking in our stress testing methodology and we will recalibrate it if and where it's appropriate to do so. Number one your comment about margin and collateral. I mean, I think the way that we think about it as we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true, and James as mentioned it wasn't necessarily, it was a family office. It wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us. So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies and we'll continue to be diligent around all of those points.\nAijaz Abdul Hussain: Thanks for your answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great day, good morning. So, wanted to ask a question about the recent announcement to offer a few specific bitcoin related funds to wealth management clients and appreciate you have to walk before you run here and it's pretty small, but just given how fast the ecosystem is developing and the interest in the space lobby just maybe give some thoughts on, I guess, one what the reaction was in currently, and then two just tell us more broadly as you're thinking about the crypto space across the organization?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. And I think your comments are very appropriate. It's a fast-growing space. There's a lot of interest in the space. And we had a significant interest from our wealth clients to try to get access to this new asset class. And so we tried to facilitate that. We've allowed within our wealth management platform, qualified investors to get access through two specific passive funds, if you will, that access to the crypto currency. The uptake and the interest level has been strong, and we would expect people to continue to be interested in this space. And we will continue to monitor it and evolve. And we are in the business of trying to provide services and investment opportunities that interest our client base. And as we continue to see more or stronger interest, we will continue to try to work with the regulators and others to provide services that we think are appropriate.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, perfect. Let me squeeze in a quick follow-up here. Just on the SPAC market, clearly has played a role I think there. The record amount of investment banking activity in the market really started to lock up a bit over the past month on the PIPE side. And now the SEC is adding some more scrutiny here. So, I just love to maybe think the backlogs there and expectations moving forward to kind of work through those backlogs, and then, in the IPO market kind of do a hand off year, the traditional route have gone public if the SPAC market soars?\nJonathan Pruzan: Sure. I mean, listen, the SPAC or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or a direct listing. And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very active very strong. And we have been a market leader in that space. You appropriately point out that the backlog I think over 200 SPACs on file. So, I would expect that we will continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a pause as market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it. So, I don't want to get in front of that. But, there is clearly interest in this product both from an issuer and a buyer perspective. And I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A product. But I would also point out there is a couple hundred million dollars sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment. But, there is also a $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So, if you put multiples or leverage of those, there is a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Exane Paribas. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Sigee: Hi there. Thank you. I would like to carry on the discussion about the revenue growth drivers in wealth management. So, I agree with you, I think the upside is huge from that. Is it too early to see signs of revenue synergy between E*TRADE and the workplace channel and the advisor channels whether it's customers bringing in assets held away or starting to cross over into other channels and use other services? Can you see signs of that yet, or is it too soon?\nJonathan Pruzan: Yes. I mean I think as I mentioned, we are seeing some anecdotal signs of that. We are running some private programs. We think we are capturing some of the traditional E*TRADE clients who might have left that platform for incremental advice and now they are staying with us and working with our financial advisory platform. So, I think there are very good early signs. And I think you are seeing some of that obviously in the NNA. The other point I would make is in terms of the workplace retention when we announced the transaction, we targeted a 15% retention rate there. It's early days, but we are pleased with the progress that we are making. E*TRADE is still -- the E*TRADE platform retention rate is still well above 15%. So, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that. And as we get further along on this journey, we will start to give you more color on that. But, early anecdotes are quite positive.\nJeremy Sigee: Okay, great. And, could I just ask a follow-up, a technical question on Archegos? I know you are fed up with this topic, but just a technical question. Does the fact of the loss which is now in your data history, does that have any mechanical calculation impact on risk ratings or capital requirements in your PB business?\nJonathan Pruzan: Again, the volatility related to this event was as James said, was very short in terms of time series. So, I think the answer is it will not have a meaningful impact to the overall capital requirement.\nJeremy Sigee: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2021 was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses. It was marked by some truly extraordinary highs; numerous performance records; the closing of the Eaton Vance deal, our second strategic transaction in the last year; and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund, Archegos. In summary, we generated record revenues of $15.7 billion and an ROTCE of 21.4%. The higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business and the quarter's efficiency ratio was 66%. Wealth Management generated revenues of approximately $6 billion. Net new assets were $105 billion, which is easily our best ever quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business. These flows represented annualized increase of over 10% of beginning period assets. Pre-tax margin was 27.9%. This margin should only improve in future years, and we expect will exceed 30% as rates tick up. Daily trades reached a new record, with heightened levels of retail client engagement. E*TRADE, and particularly the strength of the self-directed channel, has exceeded our expectations. In addition, assets continue to migrate towards advice. Fee-based flows for the quarter were a record $37 billion. We're adding new clients at a record pace, creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services. Our workplace business is adding corporate plans, and as a result, the number of participants we reached increased to 5.1 million. Institutional securities revenues of $8.6 billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged. Fixed income had the strongest first quarter of the last decade, and has consistently gained share in recent years. Investment banking revenues reached a record, driven by record equity underwriting. And our Equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade. Turning to Investment Management. On March 1, we closed our acquisition of Eaton Vance, bringing together two high-performing assets managers. Our teams at both Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service. The momentum Eaton Vance and MSIM demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination. Since we announced the transaction in the beginning of October, pro forma assets grew by nearly $200 billion, and pro forma net flows were approximately $100 billion. In the first quarter, pro forma net flows were $53 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 16%. Our industry-leading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination, and increasingly recognized the highly differentiated value offering solutions that we offer across the global platform. Investment Management now has assets under management of $1.4 trillion, and is very well positioned in key secular growth segments. Let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of Archegos. First, we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales, culminating on Sunday night, March 28. That resulted in a net loss of $644 million, which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us. Subsequently, we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions, which are not especially problematic, might have been. We decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible, and in so doing incurred an incremental loss of $267 million. I regard that decision as necessary and money well spent. The results are all reflected in Q1. I'm very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation. Let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. The performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations. And as importantly, the integration so far is proceeding without major incident. These acquisitions, when combined with our existing wealth and investment management businesses, drove our client assets to $5.7 trillion, of which approximately $150 billion represented net new client assets to the firm this quarter. We are more convinced than ever that both deals help position Morgan Stanley for growth in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together we'll take your questions. Well, Brennan, let me have a go at that. I mean historically, the growth rate, as you probably know in the full-service, as you call it, wirehouses has been, I don't know, 0% to 2% over the last 15 years, with loss of financial advisors, some loss of assets into the RAA channel, and clearly loss to some of the direct distributors, and generally just not having in place significant growth plans. And I think this quarter, and I'll talk about the absolute levels in a minute. But this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that Wealth Management business. Number one, we needed to have a compelling direct channel. We have that through E*TRADE. Number two, we needed to have a compelling workplace platform, we have that through Solium and E*TRADE. Number three, we needed to have net positive FA growth in terms of recruiting, not in just numbers of bodies, but actual people who are brining in assets, and we're doing that. And number four, you need a compelling platform of ideas which link to our institutional business and the quality research and product. You're just operating at a different level. And so, I think it's a culmination actually of a lot of things, E*TRADE is clearly a factor in it, but it's by no means the only factor. If you took out E*TRADE, the organic growth was tremendous in the core business, which again we've started to see in the last couple of years. I think we showed some numbers last year of around 4%. Our target, I think, was 4% to 6%. Now this at 10%, well, Q1 is probably going to be your best quarter. Q2 usually has some tax factors -- tax flows going on. But listen, the growth rate is real. If we annualize 10% a year for the next several years that would be spectacular, but that's certainly not what we're planning on, and got to be realistic. But to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors, even for a quarter, is just -- it's a wonderful green shoot to have planted out there. Morning. Yes, I think -- I mean, my comment about the way this team has worked together now for a decade. We all went through the financial crisis, most of us in sort of a job or level below where we are now. So, I'd say, the accumulated, both scar tissue and experience is very real. And we have a philosophy; we cauterize bad stuff, and deal with it as soon as we possibly can. This was, as you know, a very unusual event. It was a family office actually, no outside money. It got to enormous size by the growth in their single stock position, very concentrated single stock loan positions that had exposed to growth. And they're offset by the various shorts, in the indices that they were short. So, it was -- and I think what -- the lessons are still unfolding, if you will, or learnings, Steve. But it's not going to change how we feel about the Prime Brokerage business at all. This is a gem of a business that we've probably generated, I don't know, something close to $40 billion in revenue in a decade. It's a core part and backbone of the equities business. So, it doesn't change that at all. But I think we'll certainly be looking hard at family office-type relationships, where they're very concentrated, and you have multiple prime brokers. And frankly, the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions. And that's something I'm sure the SEC is going to be looking at, and that's probably good for the whole industry. Better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be. So, obviously, there's not a lot I can and should be saying publicly about it. But we're -- as I said, we've never happy taking a loss, but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done, and that's what we did. And we took the extra bit, frankly, just to clean it up by quarter-end, we didn't want this thing to be lingering. Well, going to try and touch on a couple of them. And to be honest, there was a lot going on in this quarter. And so I don't want to spend too much with talking about a specific line situation, which is now done on history, but let me touch on a couple of things going to the reverse, sort of why we didn't disclose, we were having a record quarter. But the business was having a record quarter, the equities business, where this resided was having a record quarter. So you've going to be at a level where it's material to the overall quarter and I'll leave that up to the lawyers, but we're very comfortable with that. That's frankly, at given how the firm was performing, I think we generated $2 billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of I don't know 340 quarters that we've had since our origination. So you've got to sort of focus on, on the big picture on that one. What was different about this situation relative to our weight, and yes, you're right, I don't think we've had, we went back through the records and I don't think we've ever had this a long time, but a loss in the PB business and the businesses back to the previous question from Steve, the business is very well risk managed and has been for decades now. And we are the number one prime broker in the world. We were the number one prime broker in this particular instance. There were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund. They were levered across multiple prime brokers and as I said, the disclosure rules, as I understand them, and I'm not the expert on it made it more difficult to understand exactly who was holding, what, where, and that's something that we'll work through and that's part of the learning experience. It was complicated. I will say last comment on this, by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriting; we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting, which happened on that Friday. So, we had to hold off, which caused us to be later than some if you will. And the reason for that was not that we weren't aware of what was going on. We just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with. So, anyway, it's a long story, but again, in the context of equities business, equities had a record with this built into it, which is pretty extraordinary. Can we have the next question, please? We can now, sorry about that. Mike, I just said the two kickers, there will be some obviously these markets won't state this kind of retail activity forever. But the two strategic kickers behind this business are yet to really have the impact that they will have, obviously, the deposits and as rates rise, that will be a phenomenal additive. And secondly, the whole workplaces we're integrating with Solium. And that's proving we had some stats in there, I think about 5 million plus clients in there. But that's a huge growth business for us. And I think that'll be sort of the story of the next five years, as much as the elevated activity will be. Well, I'll give you a couple of things, just on the -- we're in a quiet period. So those things, there are certain times when you can't comment about the business unless you sort of pre-announce earnings, which we weren't going to do given that it was a record. So secondly, I don't I'm not going to comment on other firms. Some of them weren't even prime brokers to this institution. I don't think so. Each of them have their own bid, and they make it and thirdly, the context is the business is a phenomenal business. It's been risk managed very well. This was a very unusual incident. I think the family office, I don't have those numbers, Jon might have, I suspect it's less than 10% of the prime brokerage business, very small. So, yes, Mike I mean listen, we're quite transparent about this. We don't like to take losses ever. Unfortunately, when you intermediate flows of capital, you sometimes say that's what our whole margin book is. And the question is, once you're faced with the reality, how does the team come together to deal with it? And I think they did. As I said, I think they did a really good job. Just to add to it, I can't tell you how excited I am about the combination of these four businesses, the Eaton Vance, our own investment management business, a traditional co-wealth management business in E*TRADE and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals. I mean, look at the parametric product in Eaton Vance, it's extraordinary. They've done an unbelievable job. Calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space. As I said, the workplace with E*TRADE and what we've done with solely in there. And now we'll be one of the top two workplace providers in the world, things that we can do to expand internationally and taking Eaton Vance product using our international distribution putting some back core equities product on the Eaton Vance domestic distribution, they have a great capability there. So it's just -- there is so many verticals now, which are driving growth. Once upon a time when we had the coal business, that sort of number of financial advisors and productivity per financial buzzer, that's basically the only two metrics you needed to follow. And now we've got like 30 different things that are bobbing along. So, you know, sort of watch this space. My target is $10 trillion of money under management. I've told the team internally. They hate that. But you know what, I told Danny [indiscernible] a couple of years ago that my target, I said on a public platform was a trillion dollars assets under management in the wealth asset management business. And he correctly pointed out, it's revenues per asset. It's not assets. And I said, yes, I know, but I'd like $1 trillion with high revenues per asset, and guess what, we've got $1.4 trillion when we started the wealth management journey 12 years ago, we had 500 being under management, now we have $4 trillion. And so we're heading to 10 trillion, we've got all these growth verticals and I just couldn't be more excited about it. I think you sort of highlighted some of the things that are going to drive the growth going forward. I mean, again, we want more corporate accounts. We're seeing the pipeline very strong. The hit rate is higher and the product is really resonating. We then want to grow the participants. And then once the participants are in the system, we need to build trust and relationships with them through content, through education and through services, because the ultimate goal as you said is to convert them to a broader client. And when we first convert them, we're reasonably indifferent whether they go into the self-directed channel, the FA channel, a virtual channel, because that'll just give us an opportunity to build that relationship, deepen that relationship as the clients requirements and services and needs change, we'll be able to grow with them. And so your comment about migrating wealth client across the different platforms be the ultimate goal, but first we want to build trust with them, bring them into the Morgan Stanley relationship, one of the keys is to try to have that integrated experience across the platforms for the clients. So that's a lot of the technology that we're trying to build too. So we want to bring them in, deepen the relationship and then let them go to the channel that best suits. Good to hear. I'll just make one comment.

Across businesses and regions, performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.22, our ROTCE was 21.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 66%. First, some housekeeping. To improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter. You can find more details and three years' restated data on pages 12 and 13 of the supplement. The more significant items are as follows. For the firm, the provision for credit losses for HFI loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses. In Institutional Securities, sales and trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income, which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses. And other revenues, notably contained corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges, as well as the impact of deferred compensation plans. And in Investment Management, following the closing of the Eaton Vance transaction, we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into two lines. Asset Management has been renamed Asset Management and Related Fees, although the historical numbers remain the same. And we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named, Performance-Based Income and Other, notably carried interest. We have also updated our AUM disclosures, Alternatives and Other has been updated to Alternatives and Solutions, to reflect the addition of most of the Parametric AUM, excluding Parametric's portfolio services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called Liquidity and Overlay Services. Now to the businesses. The momentum in Institutional Securities witnessed through the back-half of 2020 continued as clients remained high engaged. Several performance records were set as revenues were broad-based and balanced across businesses and regions. Revenues were $8.6 billion, representing a record and a 66% increase compared to the same period last year. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex. Regionally, Asia remained a standout, building on the four best quarters of the last decade, in 2020. The first quarter of this year set a new record. Europe's performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade. Investment banking generated revenues of $2.6 billion, more than doubling the prior year, driven by record underwriting results. Advisory revenues were $480 million, reflective of higher completed M&A industry volumes versus the prior year. Equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active. Record revenues of $1.5 billion reflect its strength across products and sectors. IPO activity was extremely strong, with blocks, follow-ons, and convertibles also notable. Fixed income underwriting revenues, of $631 million, were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year, as companies continue to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment. We saw strong activity across non-investment grade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers. Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across products. Strategic dialogues are active. Equity markets should support issuance, and conditions remain favorable for borrowers. And we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and healthcare. Equity revenues reached $2.9 billion, the strongest in a decade, as global equity market volumes remained elevated. Derivative results were the best in the decade, reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment. Both cash and Prime Brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year. Revenues associated with higher volumes and higher Prime Brokerage balances respectively were offset by the losses James discussed. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade. Performance was broad based across products. The debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery, the passage of U.S. fiscal stimulus, and the movement in passive rate supported client activity. Micro performance continues to be strong. A meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals. Macro results were robust that were reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bid-ask spread were more stable this period. And commodities also had solid results. Other revenues of $323 million improved meaningful versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower mark-to-mark losses on corporate loans and related hedges. Turning to ISG lending, our credit portfolio continues to perform well. Improved confidence in the economic outlook and pay downs on corporate relationship loans particularly non-invest grade resulted in a release of $93 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter were $10 million. And our allowance for credit losses on ISG and lending commitments now stands at $1 billion. Total ISG loans were up $2.5 billion while lending commitments increased by approximately $5 billion relative to 4Q as we continue to support our clients. Our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than 10% of the overall ISG loans in lending commitment. We saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investment grade clients that were largely offset by pay downs. Approximately 90% of this portfolio like our entire ISG portfolio is either investment grade or secured. And lastly, forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately $300 million. Turning to wealth management, given the timing of the close of the E*TRADE acquisition, I will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year. Revenues were $6 billion with strength in every area. Excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million versus the prior quarter revenue increased 11%. Integration related expenses were $64 million. And excluding these cost, pre-tax profit increased 28% to a record $1.7 billion. And the PBT margin was 27.9%. The underlying growth drivers in this business remained extremely strong. Net new asset growth was $105 billion driven by net new clients, asset consolidation from existing clients, and stock plan retention. Fee-based flows were a record $37 billion and self-directed channel net new households grew by a record $500,000 or 7%. Financial advisors also recognized the value of our platform demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention which also benefited M&A. Elevated client activity across both advisor-led and self-directed channels drove strong transactional revenues. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 19%. Client engagement in the market was high putting more cash into equities in the quarter. Self-directed engagement was particularly robust reflecting record net buying activity. Daily average trades on the E*TRADE platform reached record highs of $1.6 million, almost 50% higher than the fourth quarter record of $1.1 million. Importantly, revenue related to the E*TRADE platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the PBT margin. Asset management revenues were $3.2 billion, up 7% sequentially benefiting from higher asset levels and record fee-based flows. Fee-based assets are now $1.6 trillion and have grown over $400 billion from last year, greater than the cumulative growth of the prior six years and revenues were up nearly 20% from the prior year. Loan growth remains extremely robust with balances reaching $105 billion. Demand across products with particular strength in securities based lending led the quarterly balance sheet of $7 billion, north of the 10% full-year guidance we gave earlier this year. Continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth. Net interest income was $1.4 billion including prepayment amortization which turned positive, and was approximately $100 million. Excluding prepay, NII was up 6%, and in line with our prior guidance. The increase reflected the realization of funding synergies, driven by the onboarding of $20 billion of deposits that were previously swept off E*TRADE's balance sheet, rose in bank lending balances, and increased margin lending in the self-directed channel. We have now completed the onboarding of approximately $25 billion of deposits since we closed the E*TRADE transaction, and we remain on pace to realize approximately $200 million in NII funding benefits in 2021. We would also expect to runoff additional $16 billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year. We expect that NII will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending. We're even more excited about E*TRADE today then when we announced the deal as momentum on E*TRADE platform is robust. Additionally, we are beginning to see early successes from the combination. The business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarter's NII. And while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of the year, rather than individual quarters, we are encouraged by the strong start. We continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress for their integration. Rest of 2021 will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive datasets, which covered advisor-led and self-directed clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisors to service those needs. Over time, we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey. Workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward, and we are building on the investments we have made to date. Our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients. We are adding new B2B clients and participants at a record pace, and our current pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Equity plan wins increased by approximately 70% versus 1Q last year, and this led to the addition of 75,000 participants to the Morgan Stanley at work platform. The number of participants now stands at $5.1 million. We are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds. Today, approximately 50% have one, and we expect 90% of participants will have a companion account within 18 months. This will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows. On the expense side, we're on track to realize a $100 million of cost synergies in 2021, and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end. On a run rate basis, we expect to achieve 35% to 40% of the targeted $400 million expense synergies by the end of the year. Moving to investment management, on March 1, we closed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. We issued 69 million shares and $5 billion of common equity. We created approximately $9 billion of goodwill and intangibles, including $4 billion of intangibles, of which, half will amortize over approximately 15 years. Our CET1 ratio is impacted by approximately 80 basis points. This quarter's results include one month of the buying businesses, financial, so comparisons to prior periods are difficult. I will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward. We're pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcements closed, and total AUM now stands at $1.4 trillion, an increase of 40% or $400 billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. Upon close, Eaton Vance added approximately $590 billion to our total AUM. The underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong. Positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses. Total net flows on a pro forma basis were $53 billion for the full quarter. Long-term pro forma net flows of $22 billion were broad-based across products and region. We saw a particular strength in MSM global equity strategies, which continue to attract robust flows following strong investment performance. Our metric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line. We believe customization is a long-term secular trend, and parametrics is the market leader in this space. Eaton Vance is leading a floating rate loan business, recovered to strong positive flows, and Calvert saw strong growth as ESG investing accelerates. In the quarter, revenues were $1.3 billion. Consistent with strong growth in AUM, the contribution from more durable management fee revenue has meaningful increase, and asset management and related fees were $1.1 billion with just one month of Eaton Vance contribution. Performance-based income and other revenues were $211 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across our alternative funds. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds, which continued their recovery from 1Q '20. Total expenses were $944 million, of which integration-related expenses were negligible. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion, reflecting higher client activity levels, and the addition of Eaton Vance. Standardized RWAs were flat to the prior quarter, at $454 billion. And our standardized CET1 ratio declined from the prior quarter, to 16.8. Our tax rate was 22% for the quarter, and we continue to expect our full-year 2021 tax rate will be approximately 23%. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, as our three world-class businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth. Pipelines are healthy, institutional and retail client engagement is strong, and our global positions have improved. With the successful closing of the Eaton Vance deal, we continue to drive our business model towards more durable, more recurring, and less capital intensive businesses. While it's very early in the integration, the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services within our large customer base has led to approximately $150 billion of net new client assets to the franchise. And our unique business model is well-positioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Sure. I think the short answer is, yes. We've really got some nice tailwinds from the loan growth that we've been experiencing, as well as the deposit funding synergies. I think, as I said in the first quarter, we don't expect any movement in policy rates. The short end is really what benefits the NII, so our growth we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits, which as you know, was feathered in over the quarter, and so that, we'll have the full impact next quarter. At $7 billion of loan growth, we're running ahead of plan there, so that's obviously a nice tailwind. And then as I said, we'll continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits run off because of the onboarding. So, we feel good about the guidance we gave you. The $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate, and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth. We also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending, which is not in the bank, but is part of the wealth management NII story. So again, just a nice quarter, and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels. So the weighted average cost of deposits is 18. It will clearly continue to tick down over the course of the quarter, assuming short-term rates don't move. And again, we're not expecting policy rates to move as the wholesale higher cost wholesale deposits roll off. I think, as you recall, when we originally announced the transaction, I think we talked about $150 billion of funding synergies. We've revised that to $250 billion given the growth in deposits. You said that we would realize that in $200 billion of which will be realized this year. So we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in 2022. So, all of the sorts of a movement, if you will, in the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our funding synergy calculation. So the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates aren't going to move. So there's not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates and NII will grow because the quantum will grow based on loan growth. And then we pick up the funding soon. Thank you. Sure, Christian, it's Jon. I'll take that. I would say just first on net recruiting. I think you've heard us talk about this for the last several quarters, we've been very active, we've become a destination of choice. All the comments that James made about the breadth of the platform, the intellectual capital, the technology investments that we've made have made our platform and our company a place where FAs wants to do business. So we've seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline, as we bring in FAs and they're successful, and they like the platform. They're obviously talking to their previous colleagues, and therefore it's sort of accelerating. So we've seen really nice net recruiting. We're bringing in bigger teams, better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down. So that's point number one, in terms of just the contribution of NNA, it was really across all the comments that I made net recruiting aided in the NNA, the E*TRADE platform contributed to the contribution, new clients in the FA channel bringing in existing clients away. So just broad based activity, very, very active, we talked about client engagement being quite spectacular this quarter, and it really aided those numbers but broad based. Sure. And again, I think that as I said, the Fed business, it was really every business in all geographies contributed to that quarter $3 billion of revenue, the team is working extremely well together, we're gaining share in that business, the depth of the franchise continues to improve, as you can imagine, in this environment, where the debate around rates and inflation and credit yields. So generally speaking, the credit products have been quite active and volumes have been quite elevated. Also, it's being aided by the primary calendar agency issuance. And so just a lot of good activity going on in credit, and I think as you saw, this quarter, a lot of debate around rates inflation, reflation, which really added to those results. Sure, Mike. No, we're really pleased with the timing of the transaction as you highlight, just if you look at number of clients, volumes, trades, all of the metrics that we historically looked at in that business, they're dramatically higher today than they were when we announced the transaction back in February of last year. So we're also seeing that same engagement across the FA led channel. So it's not just related to the E*TRADE. So I think client engagement is very, very strong at 1.6 million average trades, that's on top of a 1.1 million average trade in the fourth quarter, which was a record, it was less than a million over the course of last year. So we're clearly at elevated levels. So I think we go back to the 200,000 or 300,000 trades they were doing in '19, no. But can we sustain this level? No one's got a crystal ball. But right now, clients are extraordinarily engaged. And we'll have to see how this plays out over time. It's a great question. And again, without the crystal ball, I'll just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw in the first quarter. And then we collectively decide where we think that'll persist for what period of time, we clearly still have strong asset values. I mentioned, we have healthy pipelines and clients are significantly engaged both retail and institutional, markets are open, there's a lot of liquidity. And we're seeing a continuation of the accelerating economic data around the globe. Obviously, news coming out of China this morning or last night in terms of the growth recovery, so really good backdrop or macro backdrop. As James mentioned, seasonality the first quarter is usually the strongest. Typically, it wasn't last year, but typically it is the strongest in these businesses, we're confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year, in terms of our strategic goals. We do believe and I think the data supports that we're gaining market share across all of our businesses. So that's something that we would expect to persist. And I think this year is really going to be focused on that, just growing our market shares and integrating these two very important acquisitions. I think James mentioned a couple of those already. I mean, I think what we've said all along, we're going to be very deliberate with the integrations, these deals were not about costs, they were about growth. And we do not want to, we don't want to disrupt the client experience, we obviously want to enhance it over time. So we're being very deliberate, we're investing in the platforms, we're investing in the service model and we're in the process, as we've mentioned before of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand what we need, so we can service our clients better. So, for example, we're defining running pilots around lead generation. We're defining the FAs, it will be part of that program. We're looking at data analytics and scoring models. We're making the investments in the engine that will help us match the FAs to the client based on specific needs. And the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes, the people and the process to be able to support our clients in the coming year. So we think there's huge potential. James mentioned the 5 million workplace participants were only clients outside of that channel with about half of those, that business continues to grow. The great thing about that business is that it's scalable. Think of it is a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships, that experiences digital. So, it is very, very scalable. And we would expect real growth not only in that channel but to drive growth across the platform, really out of the workplace. Yes. Glenn, John is going to answer, but sorry about cutting off the four rows in personal, trust me, I like you, don't know quite what happened, but I told the team, let's get you back on for another go at it, to dub you back. I think that the short answer again is that we're very pleased with the performance from the fixed income business. We've deepened the breadth of the franchise as you said, credit has historically been a strong point for us, but we're seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space. And so again, we think we've gained market share since we've restructured this business. We were probably a 6% or 7% player before. We're now probably a 10%, maybe even 10% plus player. We would expect to maintain that market share going forward, potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more, but we've been very pleased with the balance of the business and the results over the last several years in this. Yes, I would just and I think just pulling some of the threads of your questions together, just make a couple more observations. First, as we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios. As James mentioned, we're looking in our stress testing methodology and we will recalibrate it if and where it's appropriate to do so. Number one your comment about margin and collateral. I mean, I think the way that we think about it as we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true, and James as mentioned it wasn't necessarily, it was a family office. It wasn't necessarily that they had large concentrated positions. It really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions, the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street, and it wasn't apparent to us. So I think that's what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique. We scrubbed the portfolio. We haven't found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies and we'll continue to be diligent around all of those points. Sure. And I think your comments are very appropriate. It's a fast-growing space. There's a lot of interest in the space. And we had a significant interest from our wealth clients to try to get access to this new asset class. And so we tried to facilitate that. We've allowed within our wealth management platform, qualified investors to get access through two specific passive funds, if you will, that access to the crypto currency. The uptake and the interest level has been strong, and we would expect people to continue to be interested in this space. And we will continue to monitor it and evolve. And we are in the business of trying to provide services and investment opportunities that interest our client base. And as we continue to see more or stronger interest, we will continue to try to work with the regulators and others to provide services that we think are appropriate. Sure. I mean, listen, the SPAC or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or a direct listing. And even with those incremental and new products, the traditional IPO product has been very active very strong. And we have been a market leader in that space. You appropriately point out that the backlog I think over 200 SPACs on file. So, I would expect that we will continue to see more issuance. There seems to be a pause as market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it. So, I don't want to get in front of that. But, there is clearly interest in this product both from an issuer and a buyer perspective. And I think it does also add to some of the momentum in the M&A product. But I would also point out there is a couple hundred million dollars sort of SPAC money that can be levered and put into the M&A environment. But, there is also a $1.5 trillion of dry powder with the private equity firm. So, if you put multiples or leverage of those, there is a lot of buying power, so I think that's also a good driver of the M&A market going forward. Yes. I mean I think as I mentioned, we are seeing some anecdotal signs of that. We are running some private programs. We think we are capturing some of the traditional E*TRADE clients who might have left that platform for incremental advice and now they are staying with us and working with our financial advisory platform. So, I think there are very good early signs. And I think you are seeing some of that obviously in the NNA. The other point I would make is in terms of the workplace retention when we announced the transaction, we targeted a 15% retention rate there. It's early days, but we are pleased with the progress that we are making. E*TRADE is still -- the E*TRADE platform retention rate is still well above 15%. So, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that. And as we get further along on this journey, we will start to give you more color on that. But, early anecdotes are quite positive. Again, the volatility related to this event was as James said, was very short in terms of time series. So, I think the answer is it will not have a meaningful impact to the overall capital requirement."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update.

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to some \u2013 let to very little strategic activity and capital raising. Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position. Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled delivering growth through the next decade. Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best. Please now turn to the deck into Slide 3. What informs our confidence and growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different. On Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength. Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decades that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets that are on the whole more balance sheet-light and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management. Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets. Please turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit. The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise. Fair to say our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. But first the common acts continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe, in over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE; had the most excess risk-based capital of our peers and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets, all while integrating two major acquisitions. So, now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management. On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels. The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only three years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million. The history of the journey as illustrated on Slide 7, Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in E*TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with two new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth. Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last three years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans. On the other side, our deposit franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes. Let's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth, net new assets. Over the last three years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be up and downs in individual years. But over a three-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets. Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things, which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money. You can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships wealth held away has expanded by about 4x in the last three years. With our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets. Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention. The results of our advice-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering that of our stock plan administrative services. Over the last three years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen adviser-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working. Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets. We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion with strong growth in private credit, real assets, including infrastructure, our multi-strategy hedge fund platform and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine. Shifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15, we have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities. On Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top three global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share position. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence over resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '21 to '22 and our consistent G-SIB surcharge of 3%. Let's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB excluding the dividend add-on reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned. On Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. Over the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand. Shifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19. Starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management, we've demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years positive net new assets of approximately $300 million (ph) a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead. Now let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue which is about what we're doing currently at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create of itself over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses. So if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's going on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives. Of note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier that we've talked about in the last six months to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every three years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over three years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about by the way up to 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management. As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment. However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results and we'd be delighted to take your questions.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion, and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion. The strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and Fixed Income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do. The full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses of which $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7% excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%. Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues were offset by higher non-compensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend. As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter. As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. And this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E*TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market. Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity. Equity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions. Derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter. Fixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated, and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%. Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans referred to as DCP. This negatively impacts our full year revenues by $858 million with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement. Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%. Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represent a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products. Bank lending balances grew by 17% in the year or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13% and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by pay downs in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment. Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix, largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs. Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We enter the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized. Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds. Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies and private credit. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs partially offset by capital actions contributed to our strong CET1 ratio. We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter. The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility. The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us balance. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement we've seen so far. With that, we will now open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate all the slides, too. Okay. Two big picture questions, I guess. One, James, with the 200 basis points of excess CET1 requirements, the big buffer served you well. You've got a lot of buybacks, but also it's dilutive to returns. And I'm just curious how you balance that of keeping that buffer or is that buffer more temporary weighting on Basel III end game final results? Or is that something you want -- you plan on sitting in? I'm just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital.\nJames Gorman: Sure. Glenn, it's a great question, and it's sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the firm because right now, I think capital strategy is critical. There are a few things going on. Firstly, we have been able to reduce our peak to trough in CCAR because of the change in mix in our business. Secondly, because of the market environment we've reduced RWAs, just we've taken maybe a more prudent lean in. And obviously, we can reverse that at any point in time, which heats up CET1. Thirdly, we have the Basel III finally looks like it's coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the year, although I don't expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the beginning of 2025. So while there's a pretty long time frame, a year is a long time in this business, let alone 1.5 years, I still think that it's prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just -- I'd rather be in a position where we have excess capital when particularly in an environment where we don't see obvious places we've put it to work. Now that said, we did our best. We bought back I think it was $8 billion and $10 billion last year. We doubled the dividend the year before. We increased the dividend 11% last year. Obviously, we're -- I mean, it's fair to assume that we're going to continue moving on capital distributions. But I like a number of 15%. We actually -- we triggered a little higher than that this quarter. We could easily drop down to 14.5%. That wouldn't bother me at all, but that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities. So, great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially, and we can always act aggressively, and we've proven we will do that when we have more clarity.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. One other big picture is so Wealth Management is growing great. Everybody is happy. I think historically and even now, you've been considered very equity-centric from whether it be wealth and asset management or your dominant equities platform. So curious if you're thinking about it's possible with these higher rates, lots of clients shift to a more defensive stance. There's good income out there to be earned without much risk or too much risk. If we see a more material shift towards fixed income appetite in general, do you think that in any way disadvantages Morgan Stanley as a firm in overall profitability?\nJames Gorman: I mean, listen, our share of fixed income is 10%; banking, 15; equities, 20. So obviously, the fixed income pool grows. By the way, our share a few years ago, it was 6%. So the team under its Ted and Sam Kellie-Smith has done a phenomenal job. But if the pool grows faster in fixed income, just arithmetically, you're not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in equities. That doesn't bother me a whole lot. I mean, we've never tried to be the FX EM shop. We've never had the global rates trading, FX trading macro businesses that some of the correspondent-driven commercial banks have had, the HSBCs and Citis. And that's a business model just different. We don't have as big transaction services, so we're not going to have as much FX. That said, what the team have done in macro under Jakob, under credit and Jay Hallik in commodities is really impressive. So I'm totally fine with that. And we clearly have the product. It's not like we don't sell muni bonds to our clients, and we don't have fixed income underwriting, et cetera. We have the product. It's just arithmetically, given our share relative to the others, we wouldn't grow as fast. By the way, I was happy to see I think equities was back at number one this quarter, core franchise. And we're really well positioned, Glenn. I'm not bothered by that at all.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe first question, just Sharon, following up on the efficiency ratio about 72% for 2022. As we think about the journey from 72% to something sub-70% kind of in line with your strategic target, a sense of what it means. Is it this time? And are the businesses growing, which are more efficient and that changes the mix? Or could we see that up 70% even over the next couple of years? Would love to hear it in terms of both from a timing standpoint and what needs to happen at the firm to get to a sustainably below 70% efficiency ratio.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So if you think about, we were -- we've been below 70%, right? So if you look back to the last couple of years, and there are periods of time where we are below, there's obviously two pieces to it, both the expense side and the revenue side. I think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses, each of those dollars that we put to work will be more and more efficient. As I highlighted, where we've been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side. I noted that in my prepared remarks, and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the broader integrations of all of the platforms that we've acquired over the last couple of years. So as I think through it and I think about the timing, obviously, a different revenue environment will certainly help. And there's tremendous operating leverage, particularly as you think about the Institutional Securities business, which will help to drive that. Now if you go through each of the businesses, each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage, right? If you have a constructive market environment, we've seen very strong margins also from the Investment Management business. We're on our way to achieve the 30% margin target as you relate to the Wealth Management business. So I'd say it's a balance of both, both the revenue environment and how that turns around and then just continued discipline and making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going forward. So we've been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially nine months that we've seen with this type of environment.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess just a separate question around market activity obviously highly uncertain how Investment Banking activity shakes out. But if the Fed were to pause and the central banks are done with the majority of the rate hikes, is that enough to drive a rebound in M&A, ECM, DCM? Or do we need a lot more in terms of just confidence returning to the market before we see IB activity picking up? Like what are you hearing for the clients?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Why don't I start and if James has anything to add? I basically say that from -- if we think about the Investment Banking pipeline, the pipeline itself isn't what's changed. What's changed is that movement from the pipeline to realized. And when we think about what will cause that, that policy pivot, a peak in inflation, something that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence both with their own economic outlook and -- or excuse me, our own company outlook, the economic outlook that hinges on and then also just price clarity valuation certainty. Those are the things that as you think through it, we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the realized and announced stage. So the macro environment that you laid out where there is more clarity on the economy and then also a reduction in volatility should help that move forward.\nJames Gorman: Yes, I would say I think Sharon said it, right. And I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact. CEO's job is to drive growth in their businesses, and they do that two ways, organic and inorganic. And I've been doing this a long time, and I've done both. And the only tricky part about inorganic once you've got your strategy set is timing. And sometimes, you've got to ignore timing, but if the market is really volatile, it behooves CEOs, particularly those relatively early in their careers to be a little cautious, and that's what we're seeing. That will change.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: And just like to wish Jon Pruzan best of luck, looking forward to watching his next chapter play out. So Sharon, would love to double click on your expectations for NII. I hear you that it's sort of based on the forward curve playing out, and encouraging certainly to hear it's not peaked. But could you maybe give a little bit more color around expectations beyond forward curve? What do you assume for deposit dynamics? Do you think that the decline in sweep balances will continue to decline? What's underlying that? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So, let's take a step back and just say, why did we outperform in the fourth quarter, Brennan? And if you think about that, we obviously -- when we look at the liability side, we outperformed there, and we performed on the asset side. So if we unpack a little bit of the liability side, I take it into two pieces. As you highlighted, it's obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing. So what we've seen in the deposit mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those BDPs. Obviously, what -- where we will go from here, we'll need that to play out. But that is something that we take out into account when we think about the first quarter guidance. The second point is, obviously, on the actual liability pricing, we did see an outperformance of that pricing. And when we exit the first quarter, we take that in -- exit, excuse me, the fourth quarter and take that into the first quarter, that's a benefit as well. So, the Fed hiking 125 basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. And then certainly different question. Wealth Management, if we look at the client asset trends, they were barely up quarter-over-quarter. Basically, total client assets in wealth were up about the equivalent of the net new assets and can clearly see that self-directed and workplace were a little weak, probably because their exposure -- more exposure to the Qs and the more growthy stocks. Was -- but I would think, given what we saw in the markets that there'd be a bit more of a tailwind to client assets. Was there anything unusual that was happening there?\nSharon Yeshaya: No. Actually and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure, the underlying exposure of those different channels. So, it's just a function of the assets that you actually see as well as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So wanted to dig in a little bit further, Sharon, as it relates to Brennan's question on NII. The two pieces I want to understand a little bit better is, one, what are you assuming for SBL growth in the coming year or even loan growth broadly across the wealth complex? And secondly, you saw really nice deposit growth in the fourth quarter. I wanted to understand how much of that is a function of tax loss harvesting that you expect to be redeployed? Or do you think any of that deposit growth is actually going to prove to be a bit stickier?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I'm just going to take them -- I'll take them in order. The first is, as you asked about loan growth. The NII guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections. Obviously, the loan growth itself will be a function of the environment. As I said, from an SBL perspective, we have seen some pay downs and it will be dependent on market conditions. Now, the second quarter -- the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth, obviously, there are -- there could be a portion of it that does come from, as you mentioned, different inputs that you might see, be that interest, et cetera, in the end of the fourth quarter. But broadly speaking, what we've seen with the deposit base is that we have many channels, i.e. savings, for example, where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources, external assets held away that come in. And also, as you think about every piece of NNA that comes in over time, the $1 trillion that James mentioned, there's generally a portion of that, that's actually held from a cash perspective. And so that, I think, also needs to be taken account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit, a longer-term deposit perspective.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And just for my follow-up, as it relates to the trading outlook, I thought you guys did a really nice job of articulating some of the potential sources or drivers of inflection in Investment Banking activity. Admittedly, we've experienced a couple of years of pretty gangbusters trading and market activity. I was hoping to get your perspective on how you're thinking about the outlook for the trading businesses. If you're willing to go so far as to suggest what normalization might look like across both FICC and equities would be really helpful.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I would look at it more holistically from an institutional perspective. And so when I think about what does it mean? We entered -- I remember doing an investor conference in February of last year. And we talked a lot about what is normal and is 2019 normal. And our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere between 2019 and 2020 from an industry wallet perspective. In fact, it looks as though the industry wallet has just been right around that range within those two bonds. And when we look ahead, we would expect to remain above that 2019 level, and we'll have to see what the upside is. But a lot of that growth in Sales & Trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has also come from the fact that you have higher yields, right? So when you think about investing in the fixed income product, and you go into that going forward, that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over the earlier 2010 through 2019 or '17 outlook for Sales & Trading.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: I wanted to follow up on the wealth business and the rollout of the companion accounts and the 90% that you've headed. Can you talk about the behavior change or what has happened subsequent to clients receiving those companion accounts and try to get a sense of what that could mean on a longer-term basis in terms of increased activity and asset flows?\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely, as James highlighted in his prepared remarks, the intention is to generally be in a position where we're able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into the workplace. And so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account rollout, eventually, what that's really doing is to make sure that we've provided content. We look at content, as I've said before, as a passport into the employees. And you think about that as financial wellness. Something that Jed highlighted in his presentation in the spring is, generally speaking, when you see $1 of vested assets that come into the institution through the stock plan business, we actually see approximately $9 compared to that $1 that come from assets held away. That's the consolidation of assets once you have this advice-based channel and the advice-based relationship. And so, what we're trying to do is build on that. We have an FA referral process. We continue to use technology to help match the right individuals with the right FAs. We have better relationship management within E*TRADE and making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams. These are all ways to build the right advice for the right clients to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into the institution.\nDan Fannon: Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the longer-term efficiency potential. But I guess the thing about fourth quarter, there was some severance looking at non-comp expense as you think about next year. I just want to understand how we should think about the base level of expenses and potential changes and/or where you're looking to be more efficient into this year?\nSharon Yeshaya: I mean, we're always, as I said in my prepared remarks, looking at efficiency opportunities where there might exist. We just, as you highlight through the severance, we just had a December employee action. So, we obviously walk in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward. But as we've done with our own resources from a capital perspective, we'll remain nimble and prudent, and look forward if and as the economic environment changes.\nJames Gorman: I think just on the efficiency ratio, it's worth pointing out and Sharon mentioned this earlier, if you actually average the last two years, '21, '22, you end up right at 70%. '21 was about 67, '22 at 73. Part of it is revenue driven. We took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year. We also want to feed the beast. I mean, we're growing parts of this firm. We're trying to -- we don't -- we're not of the view that we're heading into a dark period, whatever negativity in the world is out there. That's not our house views. So we want to make sure we're positioned for growth. This thing will turn. M&A underwriting will come back. I'm positive of it. So, we want to be well positioned for it, but we're going to manage to that number of around 70% as best as we can.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: I have a bigger picture. James, you gave us some very good detail about the expectations for growth in the Wealth Management and the new assets, $1 trillion every three years. When you're looking at your three channels, the adviser-led workplace and self-directed, where do you see the most growth? And which one has the best margin that can get you to that 30% goal?\nJames Gorman: Well, the adviser is the biggest, obviously, by far. We have 15,000, 16,000 advisers, phenomenal business. The direct channel is from the acquisition of E*TRADE combined with our Morgan Stanley Direct, great business. Obviously, it's a little more market sensitive, a little more active, particularly on the option side during bullish market environments. And the workplace is sort of the sleeper. I've said previously, I think, two years ago, I thought in a decade, we'd look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change to happen over the last decade. I truly believe that the workplace employee, the retirement space is sort of the next frontier, and we're right in the middle of that. So as to margins, they're probably margin accretive in reverse order. In other words, workplace first, the direct second and the adviser third, that's simply a function of advisers. We have adviser payout, and God bless them for the jobs that they do, and we're very happy to pay them. So I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all three of them. We will hit the 30% margin. I mean, we're almost there now in a more challenging environment. So that zero anxiety about whether it's this year or next year, it's coming, and all of them will contribute.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. I appreciate that. And Sharon, you talked about the marks that you took in the corporate loan portfolio in the quarter, just over $350 million, I think you said. Can you share with us how big is that portfolio? And where did the marks come from? Were they bridge loans? Or what drove those marks?\nSharon Yeshaya: So you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending that we give. As we think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio. And it was also worth highlighting there that we also mentioned the interest that you receive on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with those loans.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: James, last quarter, I asked you when will you be ready for plan B if the pipeline doesn't seem like it's going to be converted, and you said you're at plan A minus, so just kind of looking for an update there. And in terms of the headwinds, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the pipeline is still good but down quarter-over-quarter because some of those deals have converted. And also, you said it's still not back yet. And as it relates to the Twitter financing, you were the lead bank. Can you disclose any write-down that you had on Twitter or simply the leveraged loan category? So that's the headwind. On the other hand, I guess, there's been some reports that you've reduced headcount. So if you could just give us more color on that, especially Twitter?\nJames Gorman: Okay. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I'm not going to talk about Twitter. We don't talk about single names as you would expect. You did see the line -- the other ISG line. You can assume that whatever marks we took on any single name are reflected in that. And I think the way I think about this is we run a portfolio business. We obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others. But it's the total package, and the total package, if you look at it actually turned out to be very fine given the environment we're in. So on the plan B, I don't know if the rip we did -- we took about 1,800 heads in early December, would equate to a plan B. It certainly felt like it. We've reduced -- we took a severance charge, Mike, which affected some of the efficiency ratio for this year, but we'll improve it for next year. And that was the rightsizing. We were frankly a little overdue. We hadn't done anything for a couple of years. We've had a lot of growth, and we'll continue monitoring that. Obviously, with the way bonus pools work, we reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool. So we're not very different from the rest of the world in that regard. And that obviously resets comp a little bit. So, I feel good about where the whole package is. I'm actually, as I said earlier alluded to I'm a little more confident about the long -- medium-term outlook for the market. I'm not talking about the first quarter or two, although Sharon said the first quarter has actually started well. But the medium-term outlook for the markets, I see the Fed has moved from 75 to 50, likely to go to 25. The next stop on the train line is zero and then to mention they start cutting. Not sure they're going to cut this year, but I think there'll be zero increases this year for sure. So that's the inflection point. And there's a lot of money sitting around waiting to be put to work. And that's our job is to be the flow of capital between those who have it, and those who need it. So I'm pretty confident actually about the outlook. So we're -- we've done our plan B, I guess. We're not anticipating a plan C. And we're going to watch and wait for a little while, but I feel pretty good about it.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the flows within Investment Management, both the long-term and liquidity and how you're thinking about the outlook there specifically in the long term?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure, absolutely. The long term, obviously, what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in equities. That was the most notable. That obviously had to do with some of the higher growth specific -- the specific funds that we have there. But I think you have to really think about those long terms from a long-term basis, right? So you're just focusing on this year, but there were many, many years of very strong flows into that business. What's important is actually the diversification that we had because of Eaton Vance, where we have other products that we're able to offset some of the long -- some of the outflows in, say, the equity product, for example. So parametric is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year. We're really focused on the secular growth trends, sustainability, alternatives and customization more broadly. Those are the things that we think as we move forward, we'll be positive for those line items.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to some \u2013 let to very little strategic activity and capital raising. Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position. Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled delivering growth through the next decade. Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best. Please now turn to the deck into Slide 3. What informs our confidence and growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different. On Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength. Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decades that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets that are on the whole more balance sheet-light and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management. Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets. Please turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit. The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise. Fair to say our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. But first the common acts continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe, in over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE; had the most excess risk-based capital of our peers and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets, all while integrating two major acquisitions. So, now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management. On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels. The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only three years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million. The history of the journey as illustrated on Slide 7, Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in E*TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with two new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth. Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last three years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans. On the other side, our deposit franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes. Let's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth, net new assets. Over the last three years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be up and downs in individual years. But over a three-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets. Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things, which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money. You can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships wealth held away has expanded by about 4x in the last three years. With our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets. Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention. The results of our advice-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering that of our stock plan administrative services. Over the last three years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen adviser-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working. Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets. We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion with strong growth in private credit, real assets, including infrastructure, our multi-strategy hedge fund platform and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine. Shifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15, we have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities. On Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top three global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share position. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence over resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '21 to '22 and our consistent G-SIB surcharge of 3%. Let's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB excluding the dividend add-on reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned. On Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. Over the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand. Shifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19. Starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management, we've demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years positive net new assets of approximately $300 million (ph) a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead. Now let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue which is about what we're doing currently at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create of itself over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses. So if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's going on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives. Of note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier that we've talked about in the last six months to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every three years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over three years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about by the way up to 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management. As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment. However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results and we'd be delighted to take your questions. Sure. Glenn, it's a great question, and it's sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the firm because right now, I think capital strategy is critical. There are a few things going on. Firstly, we have been able to reduce our peak to trough in CCAR because of the change in mix in our business. Secondly, because of the market environment we've reduced RWAs, just we've taken maybe a more prudent lean in. And obviously, we can reverse that at any point in time, which heats up CET1. Thirdly, we have the Basel III finally looks like it's coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the year, although I don't expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the beginning of 2025. So while there's a pretty long time frame, a year is a long time in this business, let alone 1.5 years, I still think that it's prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just -- I'd rather be in a position where we have excess capital when particularly in an environment where we don't see obvious places we've put it to work. Now that said, we did our best. We bought back I think it was $8 billion and $10 billion last year. We doubled the dividend the year before. We increased the dividend 11% last year. Obviously, we're -- I mean, it's fair to assume that we're going to continue moving on capital distributions. But I like a number of 15%. We actually -- we triggered a little higher than that this quarter. We could easily drop down to 14.5%. That wouldn't bother me at all, but that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities. So, great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially, and we can always act aggressively, and we've proven we will do that when we have more clarity. I mean, listen, our share of fixed income is 10%; banking, 15; equities, 20. So obviously, the fixed income pool grows. By the way, our share a few years ago, it was 6%. So the team under its Ted and Sam Kellie-Smith has done a phenomenal job. But if the pool grows faster in fixed income, just arithmetically, you're not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in equities. That doesn't bother me a whole lot. I mean, we've never tried to be the FX EM shop. We've never had the global rates trading, FX trading macro businesses that some of the correspondent-driven commercial banks have had, the HSBCs and Citis. And that's a business model just different. We don't have as big transaction services, so we're not going to have as much FX. That said, what the team have done in macro under Jakob, under credit and Jay Hallik in commodities is really impressive. So I'm totally fine with that. And we clearly have the product. It's not like we don't sell muni bonds to our clients, and we don't have fixed income underwriting, et cetera. We have the product. It's just arithmetically, given our share relative to the others, we wouldn't grow as fast. By the way, I was happy to see I think equities was back at number one this quarter, core franchise. And we're really well positioned, Glenn. I'm not bothered by that at all. Yes, I would say I think Sharon said it, right. And I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact. CEO's job is to drive growth in their businesses, and they do that two ways, organic and inorganic. And I've been doing this a long time, and I've done both. And the only tricky part about inorganic once you've got your strategy set is timing. And sometimes, you've got to ignore timing, but if the market is really volatile, it behooves CEOs, particularly those relatively early in their careers to be a little cautious, and that's what we're seeing. That will change. I think just on the efficiency ratio, it's worth pointing out and Sharon mentioned this earlier, if you actually average the last two years, '21, '22, you end up right at 70%. '21 was about 67, '22 at 73. Part of it is revenue driven. We took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year. We also want to feed the beast. I mean, we're growing parts of this firm. We're trying to -- we don't -- we're not of the view that we're heading into a dark period, whatever negativity in the world is out there. That's not our house views. So we want to make sure we're positioned for growth. This thing will turn. M&A underwriting will come back. I'm positive of it. So, we want to be well positioned for it, but we're going to manage to that number of around 70% as best as we can. Well, the adviser is the biggest, obviously, by far. We have 15,000, 16,000 advisers, phenomenal business. The direct channel is from the acquisition of E*TRADE combined with our Morgan Stanley Direct, great business. Obviously, it's a little more market sensitive, a little more active, particularly on the option side during bullish market environments. And the workplace is sort of the sleeper. I've said previously, I think, two years ago, I thought in a decade, we'd look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change to happen over the last decade. I truly believe that the workplace employee, the retirement space is sort of the next frontier, and we're right in the middle of that.

We have adviser payout, and God bless them for the jobs that they do, and we're very happy to pay them. So I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all three of them. We will hit the 30% margin. I mean, we're almost there now in a more challenging environment. So that zero anxiety about whether it's this year or next year, it's coming, and all of them will contribute. Okay. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I'm not going to talk about Twitter. We don't talk about single names as you would expect. You did see the line -- the other ISG line.

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion, and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion. The strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and Fixed Income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do. The full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses of which $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7% excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%. Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues were offset by higher non-compensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend. As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter. As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. And this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E*TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market. Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity. Equity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions. Derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter. Fixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated, and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%. Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans referred to as DCP. This negatively impacts our full year revenues by $858 million with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement. Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%. Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represent a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products. Bank lending balances grew by 17% in the year or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13% and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by pay downs in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment. Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix, largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs. Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We enter the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized. Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds. Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies and private credit. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs partially offset by capital actions contributed to our strong CET1 ratio. We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter. The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility. The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us balance. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement we've seen so far. With that, we will now open the line to questions. Sure. So if you think about, we were -- we've been below 70%, right? So if you look back to the last couple of years, and there are periods of time where we are below, there's obviously two pieces to it, both the expense side and the revenue side. I think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses, each of those dollars that we put to work will be more and more efficient. As I highlighted, where we've been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side. I noted that in my prepared remarks, and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the broader integrations of all of the platforms that we've acquired over the last couple of years. So as I think through it and I think about the timing, obviously, a different revenue environment will certainly help. And there's tremendous operating leverage, particularly as you think about the Institutional Securities business, which will help to drive that. Now if you go through each of the businesses, each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage, right? If you have a constructive market environment, we've seen very strong margins also from the Investment Management business. We're on our way to achieve the 30% margin target as you relate to the Wealth Management business. So I'd say it's a balance of both, both the revenue environment and how that turns around and then just continued discipline and making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going forward. So we've been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially nine months that we've seen with this type of environment. Sure. Why don't I start and if James has anything to add? I basically say that from -- if we think about the Investment Banking pipeline, the pipeline itself isn't what's changed. What's changed is that movement from the pipeline to realized. And when we think about what will cause that, that policy pivot, a peak in inflation, something that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence both with their own economic outlook and -- or excuse me, our own company outlook, the economic outlook that hinges on and then also just price clarity valuation certainty. Those are the things that as you think through it, we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the realized and announced stage. So the macro environment that you laid out where there is more clarity on the economy and then also a reduction in volatility should help that move forward. Sure. So, let's take a step back and just say, why did we outperform in the fourth quarter, Brennan? And if you think about that, we obviously -- when we look at the liability side, we outperformed there, and we performed on the asset side. So if we unpack a little bit of the liability side, I take it into two pieces. As you highlighted, it's obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing. So what we've seen in the deposit mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those BDPs. Obviously, what -- where we will go from here, we'll need that to play out. But that is something that we take out into account when we think about the first quarter guidance. The second point is, obviously, on the actual liability pricing, we did see an outperformance of that pricing. And when we exit the first quarter, we take that in -- exit, excuse me, the fourth quarter and take that into the first quarter, that's a benefit as well. So, the Fed hiking 125 basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first. No. Actually and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure, the underlying exposure of those different channels. So, it's just a function of the assets that you actually see as well as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel. Sure. I'm just going to take them -- I'll take them in order. The first is, as you asked about loan growth. The NII guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections. Obviously, the loan growth itself will be a function of the environment. As I said, from an SBL perspective, we have seen some pay downs and it will be dependent on market conditions. Now, the second quarter -- the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth, obviously, there are -- there could be a portion of it that does come from, as you mentioned, different inputs that you might see, be that interest, et cetera, in the end of the fourth quarter. But broadly speaking, what we've seen with the deposit base is that we have many channels, i.e. savings, for example, where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources, external assets held away that come in. And also, as you think about every piece of NNA that comes in over time, the $1 trillion that James mentioned, there's generally a portion of that, that's actually held from a cash perspective. And so that, I think, also needs to be taken account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit, a longer-term deposit perspective. Sure. I would look at it more holistically from an institutional perspective. And so when I think about what does it mean? We entered -- I remember doing an investor conference in February of last year. And we talked a lot about what is normal and is 2019 normal. And our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere between 2019 and 2020 from an industry wallet perspective. In fact, it looks as though the industry wallet has just been right around that range within those two bonds. And when we look ahead, we would expect to remain above that 2019 level, and we'll have to see what the upside is. But a lot of that growth in Sales & Trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has also come from the fact that you have higher yields, right? So when you think about investing in the fixed income product, and you go into that going forward, that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over the earlier 2010 through 2019 or '17 outlook for Sales & Trading. Absolutely, as James highlighted in his prepared remarks, the intention is to generally be in a position where we're able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into the workplace. And so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account rollout, eventually, what that's really doing is to make sure that we've provided content. We look at content, as I've said before, as a passport into the employees. And you think about that as financial wellness. Something that Jed highlighted in his presentation in the spring is, generally speaking, when you see $1 of vested assets that come into the institution through the stock plan business, we actually see approximately $9 compared to that $1 that come from assets held away. That's the consolidation of assets once you have this advice-based channel and the advice-based relationship. And so, what we're trying to do is build on that. We have an FA referral process. We continue to use technology to help match the right individuals with the right FAs. We have better relationship management within E*TRADE and making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams. These are all ways to build the right advice for the right clients to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into the institution. I mean, we're always, as I said in my prepared remarks, looking at efficiency opportunities where there might exist. We just, as you highlight through the severance, we just had a December employee action. So, we obviously walk in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward. But as we've done with our own resources from a capital perspective, we'll remain nimble and prudent, and look forward if and as the economic environment changes. So you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending that we give. As we think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio. And it was also worth highlighting there that we also mentioned the interest that you receive on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with those loans. Sure, absolutely. The long term, obviously, what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in equities. That was the most notable. That obviously had to do with some of the higher growth specific -- the specific funds that we have there. But I think you have to really think about those long terms from a long-term basis, right? So you're just focusing on this year, but there were many, many years of very strong flows into that business. What's important is actually the diversification that we had because of Eaton Vance, where we have other products that we're able to offset some of the long -- some of the outflows in, say, the equity product, for example. So parametric is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year. We're really focused on the secular growth trends, sustainability, alternatives and customization more broadly. Those are the things that we think as we move forward, we'll be positive for those line items."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and I know we're starting a little later than some of the previous quarters. So I appreciate you staying with us. The Firm performed well in a very uncertain and difficult environment. An ROTCE of 15%, excluding integration expenses, flexes stability and strength of the business model. Wealth Management pre-tax margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.4% and coupled with $65 billion of net new assets, demonstrates how this business even in a very volatile market environment and with indices down over 20% this year, continues to attract new client assets and remains highly profitable. This business' enormous scale and channel diversification should ensure continued success.  Investment Management and Investment Banking were clearly impacted by the market environment. But as I've said elsewhere, advisory and underwriting activity has not gone away, it has simply been deferred. Fixed income and equities remains very solid with no areas of obvious concern. Both businesses navigated the complicated markets without serious incidents.  Finally, the strength of our capital position is very clear, as shown by the continuation of our strong buyback program with $2.6 billion of share repurchases in this past quarter, coupled that with a dividend yield north of 3% and a CET1 ratio of 14.8%. On an operating basis, this Firm is doing well in a post-COVID world. From a markets perspective, we expect continued volatility as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy such to bring down inflation to acceptable long-term levels. This is an environment where it behoves management to be prudent but balanced, a wholesale retreat from the markets is not called for. But at the same time, I must be more cautious in credit-sensitive parts of the business. Fortunately, the business model changes for the past decade or more, plus the acquisitions of Smith Barney, E*TRADE and Eaton Vance put us in a position of significant relative strength and should support solid absolute performance in the months ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $13 billion in the quarter. Our EPS was $1.47, and our ROTCE was 14.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.53, and our ROTCE was 15.2%. We built our business model to perform through the cycle and withstand volatile environments, evidenced again by the performance this quarter. In Institutional Securities, fixed income benefited from macroeconomic developments and in Wealth Management, we continue to attract strong net new assets, underscoring the benefits of an advice-driven model and a variety of backdrops. The Firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 71%, ensuring future growth remains a priority, and we continue to invest in tech-driven efficiencies. And with the abatement of COVID-related restrictions, marketing and business development expenses have progressively normalized as our teams reengage with clients and our colleagues in person. Efficiency remains an important performance objective and we review incremental spend on an ongoing basis. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.8 billion, down from the robust prior year, but seasonally strong for -- seasonally strong rather, for a seasonally slower quarter relative to historical levels. Strength in fixed income and equities was a counterbalance to muted activity and investment banking. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.3 billion, with meaningful declines across products, particularly underwriting. Ongoing market volatility continued to weigh on issuance and led clients to delay strategic actions. Advisory revenues were $693 million. Solid results reflected the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Revenues were down relative to the record prior year and in line with broader M&A market volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $218 million with year-over-year declines across products, reflecting the overall volatility in global equity markets. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $366 million. Investment grade issuance fared better. Issuers took advantage of favorable windows and investors demonstrated selectivity in a more challenging market. We remain engaged with clients and strategic dialogues are active across multiple industry groups. The eventual conversion to announcement is dependent on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, growth and geopolitics as well as the stabilization of valuation. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, the business performed well against the backdrop of equity market declines and volatility. Prime Brokerage revenues decreased from last year. Results were impacted by lower average balances reflective of client deleveraging, which was partially offset by the mix of client balances. Cash and derivative results declined versus the prior year as client activity moderated. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion represented the highest third quarter in over a decade driven by strength across the macro complex. Macro revenue increased meaningfully versus the prior period. Inflationary pressure as well as central bank and fiscal activity drove volatility higher. By extension, changes in portfolios supported client engagement and increased flow trading activity, benefiting rates and foreign exchange. Micro revenues were in line with the prior year. Revenues favored the Americas more in the current period. Other revenues declined from the prior year and reflected a loss of $100 million. Mark-to-market losses on event and relationship loans, net of hedges and movements in revenues related to deferred cash-based compensation contributed to the decrease. Turning to Wealth Management. The business continues to deliver strong results despite the economic uncertainty. Revenues increased from the prior year to a robust $6.1 billion as we continue to grow the more stable parts of our Firm. The rising rate environment supported net interest income, more than offsetting the lower asset management and transactional revenues. Pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.9%. Excluding integration-related expenses, the PBT margin reached 28.4%, underscoring the resiliency of this business against the backdrop of declining asset values. Total net new assets were $65 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $260 billion. Asset consolidation from existing clients, net new clients, workplace relationships and positive net recruiting were all sources of strength. The growth of net new assets highlights the value of trusted advice especially through periods of market uncertainty. Our platform continues to attract advisors who recognize the integral role of the Wealth Management business at the Firm, and the value advisors gain by leveraging our technology and our products to best serve their clients. Transactional revenues of $616 million declined from the prior period, due to lower retail engagement and the impact of movements in revenues related to deferred compensation plans. Asset management revenues of $3.4 billion primarily reflected lower market levels. Fee-based flows were $17 billion, moderating from the robust levels seen in recent quarters, suggesting retail hesitancy to invest in managed products in uncertain markets. Bank lending balances grew to $146 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, balances have grown by $16 billion on a year-to-date basis. Rather, this quarter, balances have grown by $16 billion. The pace of loan growth slowed this quarter on the back of paydowns in securities-based lending and moderating mortgage growth. Total deposits declined by 2% in the quarter to $332 billion. There was a shift in mix to higher-yielding saving products as our expanded bank offering attracted clients' investable cash. Net interest income was $2 billion, up nearly 50% from the prior year. In this accelerated rate hike cycle, we have outperformed our model beta across our deposit portfolio, which has more than offset the changing mix of our deposit base. Through the end of the year, we would expect NII to remain broadly in line with the guidance provided last quarter. Noting that some of the rate benefit was pulled forward into the third quarter. Despite this period of heightened uncertainty and volatility, we achieved consistent growth in Wealth Management. We continue to deliver strong net new assets and demonstrate economies of scale with considerable growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined from the prior period, substantially driven by lower asset values as well as the impact of outflows over the last year. Total AUM ended at $1.3 trillion. Long-term flows were approximately $2 billion. While equity strategies continue to see outflows, the pace has moderated from recent quarters. Interest rate volatility negatively impacted fixed income flows. However, our broadened portfolio also delivered offsets. Inflows of $7 billion into our Alternative and Solutions platform were led by continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios and our direct indexing and tax-efficient investing capabilities, as well as continued demand for private credit. Liquidity and Overlay Services had outflows of $32 billion. Clients likely relocated money market holdings to alternative risk-free assets. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower average AUM led to the year-over-year decline. Performance-based income and other revenues were a net loss of $101 million, primarily driven by the markdown of a single underlying public investment in one of our Asia private equity funds. Investments in the business and the integration of Eaton Vance continue to progress well. We are investing in products and vehicles that will allow us to deliver solutions to a broader set of clients. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas such as alternatives and direct indexing, supported by our ability to globally distribute products, positions us well to perform through the cycle. Turning to the balance sheet. Standardized RWAs were relatively flat, ending the quarter at $460 billion. Prudent management of resources was partially offset by an increase due to market volatility. During the third quarter, we also bought back $2.6 billion of stock, taking advantage of our current valuation and utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected unrealized losses of $1.3 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 14.8%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory requirement, inclusive of buffers as of October 1. Capital remains critical to our strategy, particularly in this rapidly evolving backdrop. Our tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter, down from the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits. We now expect that our full year '22 tax rate will be approximately 22%. Looking ahead, the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. While we cannot be sure how the market dynamics will play out, we remain confident in our strategy, particularly our ability to aggregate client assets in Wealth Management, support our Institutional clients and deliver diversified solutions in Investment Management, all while prudently managing our capital profile and focusing on our strategic goals.  With that, we will now open up the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess -- so James, you alluded to a lot of cross-currents. I fully appreciate that. I think from your shareholders' perspective, I think why folks own Morgan Stanley is some degree of confidence on the superior ROE, defensibility of that ROE. Just talk to us as you think about -- I mean, we've already seen a ton of market volatility. As we look forward, your confidence where return on tangible equity, 15%, 16%, how defensible do you think that is and understanding the quarter-to-quarter volatility. But how defensible do you think that is? And remind us about the synergies from Eaton Vance, E*TRADE, et cetera, that we should be mindful of when we think about Morgan Stanley's growth relative to what happens to the market?\nJames Gorman: Great. Well, that's a good broad question to kick it off. I would say, first of all, we're thrilled with the deals we did with E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. I mean they\u2019ve both worked better than expectations. In Eaton Vance, for example, the gem that is Parametric as just the gift that keeps giving. E*TRADE with the deposits that we brought over through that deal, what we've done with the stock plan business is now combined with ours, 35% of the S&P companies. And obviously, having a digital banking platform, I've often described E*TRADE, it's a technology company, and we brought a lot of technology with that. So just on those two things, thrilled with it.  In terms of the overall environment and how we play in that environment, maybe I'll just touch on the environment for a minute. It shouldn't be surprising what's going on in the market. So I'm kind of surprised every time I see somebody on TV who seems surprised by it. We had zero interest rates for a decade. We have massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. We have the first land war in Europe in 70 years. The highest inflation in 40 years, and the Fed had to move. Now my opinion was they moved late, but they moved and they're going to keep moving. And rates are now around 3%, they're probably going to go mid-4s, but that remains to be determined. And with that, there will be consequences. So far, we haven't seen clarity around inflation abating. My guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year. And I think the Fed will be successful in this journey, but that's a gut from all the numbers I'm looking at, but it doesn't mean I'm going to be right. The world obviously remains volatile.  We -- you're going to see some disruption. We're seeing it. Some of the more ridiculous stuff that's been in the market in the last few years, company is trading at 50x revenues, what's gone on with Bitcoin trade at $60,000 some of the -- what's going on in some of the GameStop and other companies where there's been these sort of aberration type trading. I mean that's been washed out. And that's okay. We're back to sort of fundamentals.  So how does Morgan Stanley play in that? Investment Management, obviously gets hurt when fees are down because asset prices are down. But I'm not -- I don't think we're in a long-term financial depreciation. So I'm not particularly concerned about that. As I've said, the banking pipeline and underwriting gets deferred. People don't stop doing deals. In fact, there was a deal announced this morning. And there'll be much more deals as we get closer to economic clarity. Our sales and trading businesses remain robust. We are holding share in those. I feel very good about that. And a lot of that business is actually repeatable. If you think of Prime Brokerage, it's actually very stable. And with Wealth Management, we brought in $65 billion of new money in one of the most difficult quarters that we've had in 15 years. I mean, that would have been unthinkable even two years ago. So the fact our clients are continuing to bring us money and the funnel of all the ways the money comes in the door is working, it's not -- that's not an accident. That's a business model design. So I'm really happy with the way that's working out.  So in aggregate, I am pretty relaxed. I mean, our CET1 around 14.8%. We're required to have 13.3%, I think. And I don't know if that answers your question, we could probably spend all day talking about it. But the environment is difficult, but we are not under stress.\nEbrahim Poonawala : No, it did. And just one quick follow-up to that. At the same time, you've shown a tendency to lean in the opportunistic Eaton Vance, E*TRADE, a lot of disruption among your peers, both here in Europe. Any -- like how do you think about just Morgan Stanley leaning in to actually gain share in this backdrop?\nJames Gorman : Well, I think you've got to keep investing. And we are not making major cutbacks across the plant. I mean I'm sure Sharon will talk about expenses in a minute. We're obviously being prudent. But we don't see any reason for great draconian measures. We've built a business model. And in times like this is when -- if you can sustain it, you actually do very well coming out the other side. So I feel pretty good about our relative position, to be honest.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu : Maybe, Sharon, on the deposits, I hear your comments on deposit mix shift but sweep deposits were down, I think, 18% Q-on-Q, which I think is the worst quarter decline by significant margin. So I'm a little surprised that you said deposit beta expectations -- deposit beta is in line with expectations. I guess my question is, how are you now thinking about your guide for 50% terminal deposit beta. Is that still realistic given the Fed is still hiking and obviously the pace here of sweep deposit decline?\nSharon Yeshaya : Sure. So let me just take them and separate them a little. So the change that you saw in mix of deposits, you actually -- what we saw is we have -- I would label it as transactional cash and investable cash. The transactional cash is the sweep deposits that you're talking about. And as James said, with the expanded offering, which was also aided by E*TRADE, we have more diversified products than we've ever had before. And in fact, what we've seen is the savings account that we offer is those other deposits is where those -- that investable cash is going when it's new to the bank. So from the aggregate standpoint, Morgan Stanley actually has the vast majority of its deposits is coming from the Wealth Management system. This is important when we compare it to the last period that you're talking about because that actually wasn't the case. So we had sweep deposits. We had some savings in CDs, but a big chunk of that was actually wholesale that was coming from outside. So what James has said with us being able to attract these new assets, these are new assets that are sitting at Morgan Stanley that over time can be deployed as you think about either different investment opportunities or different transactional opportunities.  As it relates to deposit beta, we are outperforming the deposit beta that we've modeled, which is where that NII is still coming from. So NII, as you know, Christian, is going to be made of three different things: the deposit beta, the actual deposit mix and then loan growth. And taken together, that's still propelling NII to where it was this quarter.\nChristian Bolu : Okay. Maybe on just leverage lending and the bridge book. Can you speak to your balance sheet risk appetite? You guys seem to be on a number of sort of like home deals, Citrix, Twitter, et cetera. So first of all, how big is your bridge book or leverage loan book, however you want to characterize it? And then second, are you increasing your risk appetite here to capture opportunities? And then how are you thinking about managing that risk?\nSharon Yeshaya : So broadly speaking, I'd say we've been extremely prudent in terms of risk management. I think that's most notable actually when you think about our RWAs and just our capital position. So we've been looking at different risk-based metrics really over time and bringing them down over the course of the year. So that's for the entire institution, just knowing that we've entered into what feels like a more volatile period. And as you think about those different relationship and event net of hedges, over the course of this quarter, they actually were quite modest marks, given the environment.\nOperator: We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr : So maybe a follow-up on the deposit conversation. I'm curious, you have these expanded offerings. You have the provided savings accounts. How do you monitor and how do you guide client behavior? And is the goal at all costs keep deposits in-house, even if the cost of those deposits is a lot higher than sitting in a brokerage account? I'm just curious on the how to.\nSharon Yeshaya : The intention, of course, is to give the clients opportunities and choice, Glenn, as you know, which has been our position over the course of the last God knows how long. But the intention is to give them as many offerings as possible. And yes, as you said, if we can bring those assets in and give them an opportunity to have a savings account or we can issue CDs or as you've always talked about, we have other types of things such as alternatives. What it does is it brings those assets in-house. And then in a point where they want to be deployed into the marketplace, we can do that. As it relates to what we might necessarily give to different deposits, it would be, of course, again, related to the transactional versus investable cash.\nGlenn Schorr : Maybe staying in Wealth, the -- you've been very successful at growing your securities-based loan book. I think of those as extremely low risk to Morgan Stanley. But backed by securities and securities of all types have fallen a lot. So I'm curious if you can comment on how big is the book? Will it still grow? And how are you managing the whole margin call situation? Just get a mark-to-market on that, that would be great.\nSharon Yeshaya : Sure. So we have seen a pay down specifically this quarter, so just in terms of the actual book. But in terms of the risk, which you highlight, we've always said it's really more of an operational risk than anything else. We have obviously seen margin calls, and they've all been handled very well over the course of the quarter. So we haven't seen any issues there. And in addition to that, I think when you look at the LTVs, what we noticed when we have those -- we obviously look at that data internally. And it is very much in line with the longer-dated historical average. And for this quarter, it was over the course of the quarter, on average, was in line with last quarter as well. So I think that book remains very well managed, means a great opportunity and option for our client base. And of course, it will just be dependent on the environment itself.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken : I'd like to drill in a little bit, Sharon, to the comments that you made around deposit betas and deposits and what's been changing in the mix for you all. That all makes a lot of sense. I think that there's clear benefits to having deposits much more oriented to the Wealth Management business and it helps to watch that mix between the sweep and other. But the idea that the NII guide is essentially unchanged and you had $250 million growth quarter-over-quarter, that suggests that basically NII is going to be flat into 4Q. So is that -- have we hit -- given the dynamics, given you have wealthier clients and you have more of their cash, and so you -- there's -- if you want to keep that funding which is, of course, more attractive than wholesale, then you're going to have to pay for it in those savings accounts. And so therefore, is it just -- and with loan growth slowing, is it just right to just assume that, okay, this is probably like the stable level of NII for at least the foreseeable future as we head into 2023? Or will we hit a point where you'll be able to continue to see some -- resume some growth and we've just entered this transition period. How should we think about it a little bit longer term?\nSharon Yeshaya : Yes. I think -- I mean the truth is, I think we'll have to see, right? So you're right in your assumption that that's basically what it implies in terms of the quarter-over-quarter for NII. Obviously, we haven't given 2023 guidance yet. And the reason, I mean, aside from the fact that we generally give guidance in January. But aside from that, the guidance would obviously also take into place what is actually happening with the deposit mix. And I do think that this is -- obviously, is an accelerated rate hike cycle. The deposit behavior is still playing out, but the intention here is really to make sure that we have these deposits in-house, and they will continue to be deployed into the marketplace over time. So that's the balance that one is trying to achieve when you think about that deposit mix and what we're actually doing from a great bank and growth perspective. On the loan side, I think that, again, where you see the positivity is these are environmental factors, right? So when you think of household penetration from our FAs into different mortgage and lending products, those things continue to rise. So what you're focused on, which is completely fair, is really going to be dependent largely on the environment itself, how quickly you see rates move and then how you see deposit behavior play out over time.\nBrennan Hawken : Okay. That is all totally fair. Thanks for that color. Second question would be on the LevFin book. There's definitely some increased focus there. You referenced some marks through the Institutional business on the other line, which wasn't that surprising given the environment. But how are you thinking about managing those risks? There still is some inventory that The Street broadly is going to need to work through and investor appetite has been weak. And so how have you hedged that book? How should we be thinking about those risks going forward? And how are you continuing to manage it?\nSharon Yeshaya : Clearly, prudent disciplined risk management. And I think that the markets that you've seen so far underscores and underlines that. I think that the other point that I would just mention, as we think about the outlook perspective, what you saw over the course of the third quarter was that the market and issuers and others are very opportunistic as it relates to wins, and it's a window specific driven market. And so when you do see positive windows, and we saw it in August, and we saw in early September, you do see movement. And so, one is watching that calendar as you think through that. And I think we're looking for those market receptivities and for those favorable windows.\nJames Gorman : I'd just add to it. I mean, there's obviously been a lot of talk about this here in a couple of names in particular, and we can't talk about individual names as much as I'm sure you'd all like us to. By the way, they're not hung deals until they're actually out there. But put that aside. About a year ago, a little over a year ago, we turned quite conservative, Brennan. We across the whole plant we pulled in a little bit. And we pulled in with our margin book, particularly our Asia margin book. We looked across our whole Prime Brokerage platform, and we pulled in a little bit with certain clients there. And we've been quite cautious in our leverage finance arena. And as somebody mentioned one transaction, Citrix, we're actually a small player in that. So we're not -- it's not like we've been large in this space, which might account for the fact -- in the other line, which is -- incorporates a bunch of things, including loan losses, number actually is very modest. I think it was like negative 100. And there are a few pluses in there and minuses. But the aggregate picture is not that -- frankly, it's just not that troubling. We'll remain cautious, as I said in my sort of opening comments, particularly in credit sensitive areas. We're a big institution. We serve a lot of clients. You don't get this perfect. But I feel actually pretty good about the way we've navigated this so far. So stay tuned to it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon : I wanted to follow up on the wealth side in terms of organic growth. The fee-based growth did slow a bit. And I think, Sharon, you mentioned some decision-making maybe being a little bit more challenged or slowdown in this type of backdrop. But maybe could you just talk more broadly about the channels that you're seeing growth in both the total flows as well as maybe what's -- where the rate of change might be either the biggest or slowest, whether that's through existing advisors, workplace in the various funnels that you have out there?\nSharon Yeshaya : Sure. I think that's a really great question because I think it is pretty remarkable to see $65 billion of assets in a quarter such as this one, it is coming from different parts of the funnel. Specifically, though, the advice-based channel is the one aggregating the most at this point in time versus the self-directed itself, which isn't surprising. But what's so interesting about the advice-based channel is it's a, existing and new clients? Yes. But also, we're beginning to see more and more referrals and more and more anecdotes and stories where you actually see the assets that's coming through the advice-based channel is actually coming through different referrals that we might have seen from the actual workplace relationships. And so we've been on a lot of time when you look at workplace and finding a way to, a, provide better content and more content to various employers, specifically in this environment, which is very, very well received.  The number two sort of point is that when you think about the FA, we've talked a lot about how to match various FAs within the workplace. The more and more referrals and the more and more data we have, who's able to monetize those referrals, the better and better it is. And so we're seeing that continue to pick up. And then from a workplace perspective, we also have integrated various relationship managers that we might have seen with the workplace into the actual FA teams. All of those things taken together is coming through from an NNA perspective, the advisor-based channel, but it's clearly a positivity if you sort of think of the rate of change where some of that might be coming from. So I think very proud of the results on the net new asset side.\nDan Fannon : Okay. And then just to follow up on expenses. You broadly obviously talked about being focused on efficiency. But is there anything specific you can point to that you're doing differently or thinking about as you start budgeting for next year or even as we go into the fourth quarter that from a rate of change that you're focused on?\nSharon Yeshaya : Well, I'd say that we've been focused on expenses, well, all year -- I mean, we're always focused on expenses, but very much in the spring of this year, we've been taking -- and I spoke about it in the last two earnings call, a very hard look at all of the expenses and just continuing to manage them on an individual project level, understanding where all the costs are coming from and also understanding where the growth is -- we're balancing that, of course, with the need to continue to invest, not only on the business side but also continuing to make sure that the infrastructure and controls are there as you think about expanding the business. So it's really around foundational side where some of those expenses might also be coming through as you think about technology, migration, et cetera. So it's just -- it's tactical in nature as well as this holistic approach of just making sure that you're very cognizant. But it's certainly part of something that we're thinking through as we look at the budgeting perspective.\nJames Gorman : We also -- I mean, obviously, we're looking at headcount. I mean we're -- you've got to take into account the rate of growth we've had in the last few years, and we've learned some things through in COVID about how we can operate more efficiently. So that's something that the management team is working between now and the end of the year. And again, we want to provide growth opportunities across the platform, but we've also identified some efficiencies. So over time, that will become clearer.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan : I want to start on fixed income trading. Obviously, revenues have been quite healthy in the volatile rate environment. Customers moving around their portfolios, as you guys noted, been a long time since we've seen these levels of rates. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about what a higher for longer environment looks like for fixed income trading once rates settle in. I'm assuming more movement in yield on an absolute basis could be helpful, but would it be great to get your views from any historical context or just broader expectations.\nSharon Yeshaya : Absolutely. It's interesting. I think when we looked at the beginning of this year, and we said, okay, how do you think about the fixed income environment? What stood out isn't just the absolute level of rates but it's also the dispersion of what's going on in different economies. So if you think -- if you go back a decade and you had all rates at zero for every economy and all of a sudden, you've moved to a place where you have divergent views, obviously also driving foreign exchange, for example. So I think all of that taken together is one that we keep looking at. It's clear that should that continue. That's a place where one would expect higher volatility and, therefore, by definition, likely higher client engagement. And so as we go forward, that's clearly something that we're looking at. But that's how I would reflect where the fixed income market is right now versus where it's been, say, 10 years ago.\nDevin Ryan : Yes. Okay. Just a quick follow-up here, also just on kind of corporate M&A opportunities. Obviously, evaluations across financials and fintech are down pretty dramatically over the last year. And so I'm curious whether you're seeing more maybe opportunities emerge, maybe things you were looking for, but just more sellers potentially coming to market given some of the challenging macro that we're seeing and also the big change in valuations over the last nine months to a year.\nJames Gorman : I mean you're going to see a little bit of a washout in some of the fintech space. I mean this is reality. You've seen companies trading at valuations with which God we could only dream of over here in our modest little house. But they're just not reality. And that washes out, you'll see consolidation. A lot of these businesses are scale-driven businesses. We have enormous technology requirements to support cyber and stop client fraud, and data control and management and so on. So consolidation is the key word. At these prices, I think the sellers are only there if they need to sell. They're probably holding out for something a little more balanced. And maybe if my projection is right that sort of end of next year, so in the fintech space. Generally, consolidation across financial services has been the catchword for a decade, and we've moved aggressively to be at the front of that. And I think that's just reflecting reality, scale matters.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo : First one, just a general question. Can you just give more details on your tech spending, how much you're spending, what that's growing, how much is to change the bank? I know I've asked you before about how much of your workload you look to move to the cloud, maybe how many apps you have? Just a little bit more meat on the bones. I appreciated the wealth expo that you held in June. I recognize the cost avoidance that you've achieved with the acquisition of E*TRADE. Now that your backbone is complete, your tech backbone, but these are kind of high-level tech comments that you've made. So any public comments that you can give to put more meat on the bones would be appreciated.\nJames Gorman : Why don't I take that, Mike? I think we don't publicly break out tech. And maybe we'll do more of that through next year. But I would say, just to give you some sense of sort of what the focus is, obviously, moving to the cloud was a big deal, and you saw the deals that we did in that. All of the innovation that's taking place in the financial advisor channel, the next best action, the virtual advisors, all of the technology, and I think you probably saw some of that. The work we've done around workplace. Solium is basically a tech company. E*TRADE is a tech company. Building a workplace platform that doesn't revolve around a financial intermediary, but all of it goes straight from stock plans straight into vested E*TRADE accounts. We're doing a bunch of work. We just did -- reviewed our electronic trading platform in Equities, some of they're doing equities, some fixed income. And some of the opportunities to leverage the derivatives trading within the E*TRADE platform with our electronic trading within our Equities Group. So -- and a lot of stuff we're doing around cyber, data protection, data management. AI is a huge effort.  We have a group of people, our distinguished engineers, which we appoint each year, a group of very sophisticated technology software engineers and designers and we had new class just welcomed him actually last week, I think it was. So enormous amount of work going on.  I mean to your base question, tech spend is going up. I think it's fair to say along with some of our controls and compliance areas, it's the fastest-growing part of this Firm. But that's good because it's displacing things we would be doing manually, which we shouldn't be doing manually. So I'm perfectly happy to see our tech spend go up. A lot of it is around new innovation, but we're also running a plant which is driving $60 billion in revenue. And there's just basic tech infrastructure that we keep modernizing that is the backbone of that plant. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense.\nMichael Mayo : All right. Maybe drive specifics in another area. You have $65 billion of inflows to wealth in a tough market noted. But I see the definition of inflows has changed over the last year to also include dividends, interest and asset acquisitions. That's from the note in the earnings supplement. So how much of the $65 billion inflows to wealth were related to dividends, interest and asset acquisitions?\nSharon Yeshaya : I just would highlight, there are no asset acquisitions this quarter, and the dividends and interest was always included in that definition.\nJames Gorman : Yes, that's -- I mean, to my knowledge, that's not a change that has happened at least in the last two decades, so.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas.\nJeremy Sigee : You talked about E*TRADE and workplace and the multichannel business model, which I think is very powerful. I just wanted to ask because that all bedded down now? Is that fully operational humming along? Or are there any major integration steps or implementation steps still to be done?\nSharon Yeshaya : So last time, integration, I talked about this actually in the call in January, there will be a back office conversion that we'll see in 2023. But that's the most major thing that we have left to be done. As well as over the course of the fourth quarter, we will expect something in terms of integration expense, specifically from an E*TRADE perspective, it will look similar to the third quarter.\nJeremy Sigee : And in terms of referral between the channels, that capability, that's fully happening already. That's in place. It's happening all the capability is there.\nSharon Yeshaya : I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question that you were talking specifically about the integration expenses and how we were thinking about that is from a referral perspective, I would say there's still a lot more that will continue to be done. So we're just scratching the surface of that entire -- those relationships and bringing those funnels together. What I mentioned, for example, as you think about the referral programs, that's just beginning, right? So the better data that we have amongst who's the best FA to refer to the referral workplace relationship to -- that will just continue as you kind of better understand and aggregate data. Remember, we've invested a lot in the capabilities that you would consider AI in nature. It gives you a better sense of what does someone do with his or her next stock plan distribution, for example, do they buy a house, do they need a mortgage? Okay, what happens at this stage in someone's life cycle? So the more and more data that we aggregate across all of these channels, the more and more powerful the Wealth Management business becomes. So to James' point around the technology investment, that technology investment is core to be able to continue to grow the business with what we've called that we discussed this project genome before.\nJames Gorman: I'd just repeat something that Andy Saperstein said at one of the recent conferences that our plan is to generate $1 trillion of new money, new client money every three years. So it's $330 billion. Obviously, in a very difficult environment like this, it's -- that run rate is more challenging, but we've had quarters where we've been much higher than where we are now. So it's about, call it, $75 billion, a little more $80 billion a quarter. And in this quarter, we did $65 billion. That is an unbelievable number. If you think about $1 trillion, we generate over 50 basis points -- 50 basis points per dollar of assets. So that is an unbelievable revenue machine. And there are many, many factors contributing to it. It is a completely different business model because of workplace because of the direct channels, because of what we've done with the bank and the way we've changed the whole financial advisory interaction with their clients through technology.  So very exciting this path that we're on, and it's heading towards what I've said, my long-term goal here is $10 trillion in clients' money at 50 basis points is a $50 billion business. And that's the target we're heading for, and that's where we're going to go.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy : James, you mentioned that obviously, it's no real surprise the market conditions, as you described, some of the issues we've confronted this year. And obviously, capital raising is going to come back at some point. Can you guys give us a little further color on your pipelines of what you're seeing possibly for the fourth quarter as we go into the first of next year in the Investment Banking and trading areas?\nSharon Yeshaya : The pipelines are solid. The activity, I think what's interesting is continues to be across a diversified base of different companies. So it's not just about one sector in particular. But as James and I highlighted, I think it's really around that macroeconomic factors, and that's geopolitics, et cetera. But what it really ends up doing is creates uncertainty in the cost of capital and in valuation, which therefore also impacts price discovery. And so that's kind of the -- what's the clincher in terms of this realization of what remains a solid pipeline.\nGerard Cassidy : Do you think your clients are more realistic about that price discovery today, Sharon, versus maybe six months ago?\nSharon Yeshaya : I think that people are digesting the various prices and I do think that you're beginning to see that on, say, an issuance perspective, right? So if you think about the cost of capital, that also took people time to -- or rather companies time to digest and understand that we are in a different regime where treasuries are. And so it means that their cost of capital is also higher. And you might not have necessarily seen issuance right away because those corporate balance sheets were there. And now you might see an opportunistic or more prudent behavior from a treasurer or CFO. And so I think that as that mindset begins to shift, then yes, over time, the valuation mindset begins to shift as well.\nJames Gorman : I mean just to -- I'm on the road a lot, and I see a lot of CEOs. I mean I think the CEOs of sort of established or on the path to established companies are getting very realistic. And they want to get on with business. I mean you can't sit on your hands forever. You've got to figure out always a better way to do business. And the environment, it's wonderful if you have zero interest rates, but that's unsustainable. So we've moved to a normalized and obviously, we're going to go a little higher than that to beat inflation back, but people are adjusting to that. I think the ones that are struggling still, companies that -- private companies that were valued at, let's just say, spotty levels and they're doing new rounds and they're finding they're just not paid at the same. And that's hard to accept as an entrepreneur, it's their baby and they want to believe that it's what it was at the peak. And maybe it was revalued at the peak. That's just what profiting markets do. And again, some of these public companies that have traded down from their offering price because we're in a different environment and money has got more expensive. So those groups will take longer to adjust. But this is sort of real politic around core businesses that have been around for a while, they adjust pretty quickly. I mean, we all get it. We've all been through different cycles. You get a little lucky in certain cycles where things are really cheap. And then you got to move a little harder and a little faster when things aren't. And we've done deals in both kinds of cycles.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us, and I know we're starting a little later than some of the previous quarters. So I appreciate you staying with us. The Firm performed well in a very uncertain and difficult environment. An ROTCE of 15%, excluding integration expenses, flexes stability and strength of the business model. Wealth Management pre-tax margin, excluding integration expenses, was 28.4% and coupled with $65 billion of net new assets, demonstrates how this business even in a very volatile market environment and with indices down over 20% this year, continues to attract new client assets and remains highly profitable. This business' enormous scale and channel diversification should ensure continued success.  Investment Management and Investment Banking were clearly impacted by the market environment. But as I've said elsewhere, advisory and underwriting activity has not gone away, it has simply been deferred. Fixed income and equities remains very solid with no areas of obvious concern. Both businesses navigated the complicated markets without serious incidents.  Finally, the strength of our capital position is very clear, as shown by the continuation of our strong buyback program with $2.6 billion of share repurchases in this past quarter, coupled that with a dividend yield north of 3% and a CET1 ratio of 14.8%. On an operating basis, this Firm is doing well in a post-COVID world. From a markets perspective, we expect continued volatility as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy such to bring down inflation to acceptable long-term levels. This is an environment where it behoves management to be prudent but balanced, a wholesale retreat from the markets is not called for. But at the same time, I must be more cautious in credit-sensitive parts of the business. Fortunately, the business model changes for the past decade or more, plus the acquisitions of Smith Barney, E*TRADE and Eaton Vance put us in a position of significant relative strength and should support solid absolute performance in the months ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in detail, and together, we'll take your questions. Great. Well, that's a good broad question to kick it off. I would say, first of all, we're thrilled with the deals we did with E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. I mean they've both worked better than expectations. In Eaton Vance, for example, the gem that is Parametric as just the gift that keeps giving. E*TRADE with the deposits that we brought over through that deal, what we've done with the stock plan business is now combined with ours, 35% of the S&P companies. And obviously, having a digital banking platform, I've often described E*TRADE, it's a technology company, and we brought a lot of technology with that. So just on those two things, thrilled with it.  In terms of the overall environment and how we play in that environment, maybe I'll just touch on the environment for a minute. It shouldn't be surprising what's going on in the market. So I'm kind of surprised every time I see somebody on TV who seems surprised by it. We had zero interest rates for a decade. We have massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. We have the first land war in Europe in 70 years. The highest inflation in 40 years, and the Fed had to move. Now my opinion was they moved late, but they moved and they're going to keep moving. And rates are now around 3%, they're probably going to go mid-4s, but that remains to be determined. And with that, there will be consequences. So far, we haven't seen clarity around inflation abating. My guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year. And I think the Fed will be successful in this journey, but that's a gut from all the numbers I'm looking at, but it doesn't mean I'm going to be right. The world obviously remains volatile.  We -- you're going to see some disruption. We're seeing it. Some of the more ridiculous stuff that's been in the market in the last few years, company is trading at 50x revenues, what's gone on with Bitcoin trade at $60,000 some of the -- what's going on in some of the GameStop and other companies where there's been these sort of aberration type trading. I mean that's been washed out. And that's okay. We're back to sort of fundamentals.  So how does Morgan Stanley play in that? Investment Management, obviously gets hurt when fees are down because asset prices are down. But I'm not -- I don't think we're in a long-term financial depreciation. So I'm not particularly concerned about that. As I've said, the banking pipeline and underwriting gets deferred. People don't stop doing deals. In fact, there was a deal announced this morning. And there'll be much more deals as we get closer to economic clarity. Our sales and trading businesses remain robust. We are holding share in those. I feel very good about that. And a lot of that business is actually repeatable. If you think of Prime Brokerage, it's actually very stable. And with Wealth Management, we brought in $65 billion of new money in one of the most difficult quarters that we've had in 15 years. I mean, that would have been unthinkable even two years ago. So the fact our clients are continuing to bring us money and the funnel of all the ways the money comes in the door is working, it's not -- that's not an accident. That's a business model design. So I'm really happy with the way that's working out.  So in aggregate, I am pretty relaxed. I mean, our CET1 around 14.8%. We're required to have 13.3%, I think. And I don't know if that answers your question, we could probably spend all day talking about it. But the environment is difficult, but we are not under stress. Well, I think you've got to keep investing. And we are not making major cutbacks across the plant. I mean I'm sure Sharon will talk about expenses in a minute. We're obviously being prudent. But we don't see any reason for great draconian measures. We've built a business model. And in times like this is when -- if you can sustain it, you actually do very well coming out the other side. So I feel pretty good about our relative position, to be honest. I'd just add to it. I mean, there's obviously been a lot of talk about this here in a couple of names in particular, and we can't talk about individual names as much as I'm sure you'd all like us to. By the way, they're not hung deals until they're actually out there. But put that aside. About a year ago, a little over a year ago, we turned quite conservative, Brennan. We across the whole plant we pulled in a little bit. And we pulled in with our margin book, particularly our Asia margin book. We looked across our whole Prime Brokerage platform, and we pulled in a little bit with certain clients there. And we've been quite cautious in our leverage finance arena. And as somebody mentioned one transaction, Citrix, we're actually a small player in that. So we're not -- it's not like we've been large in this space, which might account for the fact -- in the other line, which is -- incorporates a bunch of things, including loan losses, number actually is very modest. I think it was like negative 100. And there are a few pluses in there and minuses. But the aggregate picture is not that -- frankly, it's just not that troubling. We'll remain cautious, as I said in my sort of opening comments, particularly in credit sensitive areas. We're a big institution. We serve a lot of clients. You don't get this perfect. But I feel actually pretty good about the way we've navigated this so far. So stay tuned to it. We also -- I mean, obviously, we're looking at headcount. I mean we're -- you've got to take into account the rate of growth we've had in the last few years, and we've learned some things through in COVID about how we can operate more efficiently. So that's something that the management team is working between now and the end of the year. And again, we want to provide growth opportunities across the platform, but we've also identified some efficiencies. So over time, that will become clearer. I mean you're going to see a little bit of a washout in some of the fintech space. I mean this is reality. You've seen companies trading at valuations with which God we could only dream of over here in our modest little house. But they're just not reality. And that washes out, you'll see consolidation. A lot of these businesses are scale-driven businesses. We have enormous technology requirements to support cyber and stop client fraud, and data control and management and so on. So consolidation is the key word. At these prices, I think the sellers are only there if they need to sell. They're probably holding out for something a little more balanced. And maybe if my projection is right that sort of end of next year, so in the fintech space. Generally, consolidation across financial services has been the catchword for a decade, and we've moved aggressively to be at the front of that. And I think that's just reflecting reality, scale matters. Why don't I take that, Mike? I think we don't publicly break out tech. And maybe we'll do more of that through next year. But I would say, just to give you some sense of sort of what the focus is, obviously, moving to the cloud was a big deal, and you saw the deals that we did in that. All of the innovation that's taking place in the financial advisor channel, the next best action, the virtual advisors, all of the technology, and I think you probably saw some of that. The work we've done around workplace. Solium is basically a tech company. E*TRADE is a tech company. Building a workplace platform that doesn't revolve around a financial intermediary, but all of it goes straight from stock plans straight into vested E*TRADE accounts. We're doing a bunch of work. We just did -- reviewed our electronic trading platform in Equities, some of they're doing equities, some fixed income. And some of the opportunities to leverage the derivatives trading within the E*TRADE platform with our electronic trading within our Equities Group. So -- and a lot of stuff we're doing around cyber, data protection, data management. AI is a huge effort.  We have a group of people, our distinguished engineers, which we appoint each year, a group of very sophisticated technology software engineers and designers and we had new class just welcomed him actually last week, I think it was. So enormous amount of work going on.  I mean to your base question, tech spend is going up. I think it's fair to say along with some of our controls and compliance areas, it's the fastest-growing part of this Firm. But that's good because it's displacing things we would be doing manually, which we shouldn't be doing manually. So I'm perfectly happy to see our tech spend go up. A lot of it is around new innovation, but we're also running a plant which is driving $60 billion in revenue. And there's just basic tech infrastructure that we keep modernizing that is the backbone of that plant. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense. Yes, that's -- I mean, to my knowledge, that's not a change that has happened at least in the last two decades, so. I'd just repeat something that Andy Saperstein said at one of the recent conferences that our plan is to generate $1 trillion of new money, new client money every three years. So it's $330 billion. Obviously, in a very difficult environment like this, it's -- that run rate is more challenging, but we've had quarters where we've been much higher than where we are now. So it's about, call it, $75 billion, a little more $80 billion a quarter. And in this quarter, we did $65 billion. That is an unbelievable number. If you think about $1 trillion, we generate over 50 basis points -- 50 basis points per dollar of assets. So that is an unbelievable revenue machine. And there are many, many factors contributing to it. It is a completely different business model because of workplace because of the direct channels, because of what we've done with the bank and the way we've changed the whole financial advisory interaction with their clients through technology.  So very exciting this path that we're on, and it's heading towards what I've said, my long-term goal here is $10 trillion in clients' money at 50 basis points is a $50 billion business. And that's the target we're heading for, and that's where we're going to go. I mean just to -- I'm on the road a lot, and I see a lot of CEOs. I mean I think the CEOs of sort of established or on the path to established companies are getting very realistic. And they want to get on with business. I mean you can't sit on your hands forever. You've got to figure out always a better way to do business. And the environment, it's wonderful if you have zero interest rates, but that's unsustainable. So we've moved to a normalized and obviously, we're going to go a little higher than that to beat inflation back, but people are adjusting to that. I think the ones that are struggling still, companies that -- private companies that were valued at, let's just say, spotty levels and they're doing new rounds and they're finding they're just not paid at the same. And that's hard to accept as an entrepreneur, it's their baby and they want to believe that it's what it was at the peak. And maybe it was revalued at the peak. That's just what profiting markets do. And again, some of these public companies that have traded down from their offering price because we're in a different environment and money has got more expensive. So those groups will take longer to adjust. But this is sort of real politic around core businesses that have been around for a while, they adjust pretty quickly. I mean, we all get it. We've all been through different cycles. You get a little lucky in certain cycles where things are really cheap. And then you got to move a little harder and a little faster when things aren't. And we've done deals in both kinds of cycles."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $13 billion in the quarter. Our EPS was $1.47, and our ROTCE was 14.6%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.53, and our ROTCE was 15.2%. We built our business model to perform through the cycle and withstand volatile environments, evidenced again by the performance this quarter. In Institutional Securities, fixed income benefited from macroeconomic developments and in Wealth Management, we continue to attract strong net new assets, underscoring the benefits of an advice-driven model and a variety of backdrops. The Firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 71%, ensuring future growth remains a priority, and we continue to invest in tech-driven efficiencies. And with the abatement of COVID-related restrictions, marketing and business development expenses have progressively normalized as our teams reengage with clients and our colleagues in person. Efficiency remains an important performance objective and we review incremental spend on an ongoing basis. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $5.8 billion, down from the robust prior year, but seasonally strong for -- seasonally strong rather, for a seasonally slower quarter relative to historical levels. Strength in fixed income and equities was a counterbalance to muted activity and investment banking. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.3 billion, with meaningful declines across products, particularly underwriting. Ongoing market volatility continued to weigh on issuance and led clients to delay strategic actions. Advisory revenues were $693 million. Solid results reflected the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Revenues were down relative to the record prior year and in line with broader M&A market volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $218 million with year-over-year declines across products, reflecting the overall volatility in global equity markets. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $366 million. Investment grade issuance fared better. Issuers took advantage of favorable windows and investors demonstrated selectivity in a more challenging market. We remain engaged with clients and strategic dialogues are active across multiple industry groups. The eventual conversion to announcement is dependent on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, growth and geopolitics as well as the stabilization of valuation. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, the business performed well against the backdrop of equity market declines and volatility. Prime Brokerage revenues decreased from last year. Results were impacted by lower average balances reflective of client deleveraging, which was partially offset by the mix of client balances. Cash and derivative results declined versus the prior year as client activity moderated. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion represented the highest third quarter in over a decade driven by strength across the macro complex. Macro revenue increased meaningfully versus the prior period. Inflationary pressure as well as central bank and fiscal activity drove volatility higher. By extension, changes in portfolios supported client engagement and increased flow trading activity, benefiting rates and foreign exchange. Micro revenues were in line with the prior year. Revenues favored the Americas more in the current period. Other revenues declined from the prior year and reflected a loss of $100 million. Mark-to-market losses on event and relationship loans, net of hedges and movements in revenues related to deferred cash-based compensation contributed to the decrease. Turning to Wealth Management. The business continues to deliver strong results despite the economic uncertainty. Revenues increased from the prior year to a robust $6.1 billion as we continue to grow the more stable parts of our Firm. The rising rate environment supported net interest income, more than offsetting the lower asset management and transactional revenues. Pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 26.9%. Excluding integration-related expenses, the PBT margin reached 28.4%, underscoring the resiliency of this business against the backdrop of declining asset values. Total net new assets were $65 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $260 billion. Asset consolidation from existing clients, net new clients, workplace relationships and positive net recruiting were all sources of strength. The growth of net new assets highlights the value of trusted advice especially through periods of market uncertainty. Our platform continues to attract advisors who recognize the integral role of the Wealth Management business at the Firm, and the value advisors gain by leveraging our technology and our products to best serve their clients. Transactional revenues of $616 million declined from the prior period, due to lower retail engagement and the impact of movements in revenues related to deferred compensation plans. Asset management revenues of $3.4 billion primarily reflected lower market levels. Fee-based flows were $17 billion, moderating from the robust levels seen in recent quarters, suggesting retail hesitancy to invest in managed products in uncertain markets. Bank lending balances grew to $146 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, balances have grown by $16 billion on a year-to-date basis. Rather, this quarter, balances have grown by $16 billion. The pace of loan growth slowed this quarter on the back of paydowns in securities-based lending and moderating mortgage growth. Total deposits declined by 2% in the quarter to $332 billion. There was a shift in mix to higher-yielding saving products as our expanded bank offering attracted clients' investable cash. Net interest income was $2 billion, up nearly 50% from the prior year. In this accelerated rate hike cycle, we have outperformed our model beta across our deposit portfolio, which has more than offset the changing mix of our deposit base. Through the end of the year, we would expect NII to remain broadly in line with the guidance provided last quarter. Noting that some of the rate benefit was pulled forward into the third quarter. Despite this period of heightened uncertainty and volatility, we achieved consistent growth in Wealth Management. We continue to deliver strong net new assets and demonstrate economies of scale with considerable growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined from the prior period, substantially driven by lower asset values as well as the impact of outflows over the last year. Total AUM ended at $1.3 trillion. Long-term flows were approximately $2 billion. While equity strategies continue to see outflows, the pace has moderated from recent quarters. Interest rate volatility negatively impacted fixed income flows. However, our broadened portfolio also delivered offsets. Inflows of $7 billion into our Alternative and Solutions platform were led by continued demand for Parametric customized portfolios and our direct indexing and tax-efficient investing capabilities, as well as continued demand for private credit. Liquidity and Overlay Services had outflows of $32 billion. Clients likely relocated money market holdings to alternative risk-free assets. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower average AUM led to the year-over-year decline. Performance-based income and other revenues were a net loss of $101 million, primarily driven by the markdown of a single underlying public investment in one of our Asia private equity funds. Investments in the business and the integration of Eaton Vance continue to progress well. We are investing in products and vehicles that will allow us to deliver solutions to a broader set of clients. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas such as alternatives and direct indexing, supported by our ability to globally distribute products, positions us well to perform through the cycle. Turning to the balance sheet. Standardized RWAs were relatively flat, ending the quarter at $460 billion. Prudent management of resources was partially offset by an increase due to market volatility. During the third quarter, we also bought back $2.6 billion of stock, taking advantage of our current valuation and utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected unrealized losses of $1.3 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 14.8%, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory requirement, inclusive of buffers as of October 1. Capital remains critical to our strategy, particularly in this rapidly evolving backdrop. Our tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter, down from the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits. We now expect that our full year '22 tax rate will be approximately 22%. Looking ahead, the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. While we cannot be sure how the market dynamics will play out, we remain confident in our strategy, particularly our ability to aggregate client assets in Wealth Management, support our Institutional clients and deliver diversified solutions in Investment Management, all while prudently managing our capital profile and focusing on our strategic goals.  With that, we will now open up the line to questions. Sure. So let me just take them and separate them a little. So the change that you saw in mix of deposits, you actually -- what we saw is we have -- I would label it as transactional cash and investable cash. The transactional cash is the sweep deposits that you're talking about. And as James said, with the expanded offering, which was also aided by E*TRADE, we have more diversified products than we've ever had before. And in fact, what we've seen is the savings account that we offer is those other deposits is where those -- that investable cash is going when it's new to the bank. So from the aggregate standpoint, Morgan Stanley actually has the vast majority of its deposits is coming from the Wealth Management system. This is important when we compare it to the last period that you're talking about because that actually wasn't the case. So we had sweep deposits. We had some savings in CDs, but a big chunk of that was actually wholesale that was coming from outside. So what James has said with us being able to attract these new assets, these are new assets that are sitting at Morgan Stanley that over time can be deployed as you think about either different investment opportunities or different transactional opportunities.  As it relates to deposit beta, we are outperforming the deposit beta that we've modeled, which is where that NII is still coming from. So NII, as you know, Christian, is going to be made of three different things: the deposit beta, the actual deposit mix and then loan growth. And taken together, that's still propelling NII to where it was this quarter. So broadly speaking, I'd say we've been extremely prudent in terms of risk management. I think that's most notable actually when you think about our RWAs and just our capital position. So we've been looking at different risk-based metrics really over time and bringing them down over the course of the year. So that's for the entire institution, just knowing that we've entered into what feels like a more volatile period. And as you think about those different relationship and event net of hedges, over the course of this quarter, they actually were quite modest marks, given the environment. The intention, of course, is to give the clients opportunities and choice, Glenn, as you know, which has been our position over the course of the last God knows how long. But the intention is to give them as many offerings as possible. And yes, as you said, if we can bring those assets in and give them an opportunity to have a savings account or we can issue CDs or as you've always talked about, we have other types of things such as alternatives. What it does is it brings those assets in-house. And then in a point where they want to be deployed into the marketplace, we can do that. As it relates to what we might necessarily give to different deposits, it would be, of course, again, related to the transactional versus investable cash. Sure. So we have seen a pay down specifically this quarter, so just in terms of the actual book. But in terms of the risk, which you highlight, we've always said it's really more of an operational risk than anything else. We have obviously seen margin calls, and they've all been handled very well over the course of the quarter. So we haven't seen any issues there. And in addition to that, I think when you look at the LTVs, what we noticed when we have those -- we obviously look at that data internally. And it is very much in line with the longer-dated historical average. And for this quarter, it was over the course of the quarter, on average, was in line with last quarter as well. So I think that book remains very well managed, means a great opportunity and option for our client base. And of course, it will just be dependent on the environment itself. Yes. I think -- I mean the truth is, I think we'll have to see, right? So you're right in your assumption that that's basically what it implies in terms of the quarter-over-quarter for NII. Obviously, we haven't given 2023 guidance yet. And the reason, I mean, aside from the fact that we generally give guidance in January. But aside from that, the guidance would obviously also take into place what is actually happening with the deposit mix. And I do think that this is -- obviously, is an accelerated rate hike cycle. The deposit behavior is still playing out, but the intention here is really to make sure that we have these deposits in-house, and they will continue to be deployed into the marketplace over time. So that's the balance that one is trying to achieve when you think about that deposit mix and what we're actually doing from a great bank and growth perspective. On the loan side, I think that, again, where you see the positivity is these are environmental factors, right? So when you think of household penetration from our FAs into different mortgage and lending products, those things continue to rise. So what you're focused on, which is completely fair, is really going to be dependent largely on the environment itself, how quickly you see rates move and then how you see deposit behavior play out over time. Clearly, prudent disciplined risk management. And I think that the markets that you've seen so far underscores and underlines that. I think that the other point that I would just mention, as we think about the outlook perspective, what you saw over the course of the third quarter was that the market and issuers and others are very opportunistic as it relates to wins, and it's a window specific driven market. And so when you do see positive windows, and we saw it in August, and we saw in early September, you do see movement. And so, one is watching that calendar as you think through that. And I think we're looking for those market receptivities and for those favorable windows. Sure. I think that's a really great question because I think it is pretty remarkable to see $65 billion of assets in a quarter such as this one, it is coming from different parts of the funnel. Specifically, though, the advice-based channel is the one aggregating the most at this point in time versus the self-directed itself, which isn't surprising. But what's so interesting about the advice-based channel is it's a, existing and new clients? Yes. But also, we're beginning to see more and more referrals and more and more anecdotes and stories where you actually see the assets that's coming through the advice-based channel is actually coming through different referrals that we might have seen from the actual workplace relationships. And so we've been on a lot of time when you look at workplace and finding a way to, a, provide better content and more content to various employers, specifically in this environment, which is very, very well received.  The number two sort of point is that when you think about the FA, we've talked a lot about how to match various FAs within the workplace. The more and more referrals and the more and more data we have, who's able to monetize those referrals, the better and better it is. And so we're seeing that continue to pick up. And then from a workplace perspective, we also have integrated various relationship managers that we might have seen with the workplace into the actual FA teams. All of those things taken together is coming through from an NNA perspective, the advisor-based channel, but it's clearly a positivity if you sort of think of the rate of change where some of that might be coming from. So I think very proud of the results on the net new asset side. Well, I'd say that we've been focused on expenses, well, all year -- I mean, we're always focused on expenses, but very much in the spring of this year, we've been taking -- and I spoke about it in the last two earnings call, a very hard look at all of the expenses and just continuing to manage them on an individual project level, understanding where all the costs are coming from and also understanding where the growth is -- we're balancing that, of course, with the need to continue to invest, not only on the business side but also continuing to make sure that the infrastructure and controls are there as you think about expanding the business. So it's really around foundational side where some of those expenses might also be coming through as you think about technology, migration, et cetera. So it's just -- it's tactical in nature as well as this holistic approach of just making sure that you're very cognizant. But it's certainly part of something that we're thinking through as we look at the budgeting perspective. Absolutely. It's interesting. I think when we looked at the beginning of this year, and we said, okay, how do you think about the fixed income environment? What stood out isn't just the absolute level of rates but it's also the dispersion of what's going on in different economies. So if you think -- if you go back a decade and you had all rates at zero for every economy and all of a sudden, you've moved to a place where you have divergent views, obviously also driving foreign exchange, for example. So I think all of that taken together is one that we keep looking at. It's clear that should that continue. That's a place where one would expect higher volatility and, therefore, by definition, likely higher client engagement. And so as we go forward, that's clearly something that we're looking at. But that's how I would reflect where the fixed income market is right now versus where it's been, say, 10 years ago. I just would highlight, there are no asset acquisitions this quarter, and the dividends and interest was always included in that definition. So last time, integration, I talked about this actually in the call in January, there will be a back office conversion that we'll see in 2023. But that's the most major thing that we have left to be done. As well as over the course of the fourth quarter, we will expect something in terms of integration expense, specifically from an E*TRADE perspective, it will look similar to the third quarter. I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question that you were talking specifically about the integration expenses and how we were thinking about that is from a referral perspective, I would say there's still a lot more that will continue to be done. So we're just scratching the surface of that entire -- those relationships and bringing those funnels together. What I mentioned, for example, as you think about the referral programs, that's just beginning, right? So the better data that we have amongst who's the best FA to refer to the referral workplace relationship to -- that will just continue as you kind of better understand and aggregate data. Remember, we've invested a lot in the capabilities that you would consider AI in nature. It gives you a better sense of what does someone do with his or her next stock plan distribution, for example, do they buy a house, do they need a mortgage? Okay, what happens at this stage in someone's life cycle? So the more and more data that we aggregate across all of these channels, the more and more powerful the Wealth Management business becomes. So to James' point around the technology investment, that technology investment is core to be able to continue to grow the business with what we've called that we discussed this project genome before. The pipelines are solid. The activity, I think what's interesting is continues to be across a diversified base of different companies. So it's not just about one sector in particular. But as James and I highlighted, I think it's really around that macroeconomic factors, and that's geopolitics, et cetera. But what it really ends up doing is creates uncertainty in the cost of capital and in valuation, which therefore also impacts price discovery. And so that's kind of the -- what's the clincher in terms of this realization of what remains a solid pipeline. I think that people are digesting the various prices and I do think that you're beginning to see that on, say, an issuance perspective, right? So if you think about the cost of capital, that also took people time to -- or rather companies time to digest and understand that we are in a different regime where treasuries are. And so it means that their cost of capital is also higher. And you might not have necessarily seen issuance right away because those corporate balance sheets were there. And now you might see an opportunistic or more prudent behavior from a treasurer or CFO. And so I think that as that mindset begins to shift, then yes, over time, the valuation mindset begins to shift as well."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are doing the call a little differently this time. I am in London, Sharon is in New York. So, if we have any logistical gaps for a second or two please understand, but I think we will be just fine. The firm delivered a very solid quarter against obviously what is a more challenging backdrop. Our businesses proved resilient, reflecting an important aspect of our strategy, and that is to, as we have said many times, deliver stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining well capitalized. The integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients, grow assets and support the firm\u2019s overall stability. Net new assets in Wealth Management of over $50 billion, despite the volatility and clients tax-related withdrawals in the quarter, underscored the scale of our business and its power to attract assets. And in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets, Wealth Management delivered a strong PBT and improved margin supported by the benefits of rising rates. Investment Management benefited from its diversification and we saw continued momentum in private alternatives, parametric customized portfolios and the countercyclicality of our money market business. Finally, in Institutional Securities, our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helps materially counter what everybody knows to be limited activity across Investment Banking. Our results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out. First, we saw a significant movement in the investments related to deferred cash based compensation plans. While the marks on these investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense, they created significant drag on top line revenues in the quarter across the firm, particularly in Wealth Management, where the impact of revenues exceeded $500 million. Secondly, the quarter results also included the legal costs of $200 million that reflects the likely resolution of regulatory investigations by the SEC and the CFTC regarding employees\u2019 use of unapproved personal devices and the firm\u2019s recordkeeping requirements. This has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny. Our ROTCE, excluding integration expenses for the deals that we have done, was 14.3%, down 20% in Q1 and from last year. As I said at the outset, our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic cycle was achieved this quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance in what was otherwise a challenging environment. Finally, the Fed stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model. Our diversified business mix, as well as our strong capital position, provides us the flexibility to invest for future growth and support our robust capital return program. As such, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and announced a $20 billion multiyear buyback program. Having a dividend that\u2019s aligned to the more stable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management is a leading priority of this firm. And by the way, today\u2019s stock price, the current dividend has a yield of approximately 4%. With the buyback, we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows. Given the nature of our business model, it\u2019s especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital at what we believe to be attractive valuations. I will now turn the call over to Sharon. And as always, at the end, we will take your questions.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.1 billion in the second quarter. Our EPS was $1.39 and our ROTCE was 13.8%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.44 and our ROTCE was 14.3%. Our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against a challenging backdrop and the benefits of a balanced business model. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients\u2019 evolving needs in a dynamic environment. Wealth Management benefited from its scale and rising rates. Despite the decline in global asset prices, our expanded product set in Investment Management proved supportive to that business. The firm\u2019s year-to-date efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses, was 70%. This includes the $200 million legal matter related to the firm\u2019s recordkeeping requirements that James discussed. Given the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment, we are focused on discretionary spend while balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth. As a management team, our priority is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. We will continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective. Now to the businesses, institutional revenue of over $6 billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise against the difficult market backdrop. Revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year, while the backdrop was challenging for Investment Banking, particularly underwriting, fixed income and equities led the strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets. Investment Banking revenues were $1.1 billion, down significantly from the prior year. Heightened volatility led clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity. Advisory revenues were $598 million, reflecting lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues declined to $148 million. Results were in line with global equity volumes, which fell meaningfully versus the prior year. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $326 million, also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investment grade and non-investment-grade companies. The Investment Banking pipeline remains solid. Conversion to realize will largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop. Prime brokerage revenue... [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Please standby as we reconnect our speakers. Please continue.\nSharon Yeshaya: Our revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of $413 million. Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held-for-sale including event loans offset by gains on hedges were $282 million. This reflected the widening of credit spreads. Notable declines in deferred-based \u2013 in deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to gains in the prior year also contributed to the decline. Turning to ISG lending, as a reminder, over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment grade or secured. Our Institutional Securities Group credit portfolio continues to perform well. Our funded ratio on corporate loans stands at approximately 11%, in line with pre-pandemic levels and well below the first quarter 2020 peak of approximately 25%. Turning to Wealth Management, by several measures, performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop. We reported revenues of $5.7 billion. Results were meaningfully impacted by movements in DCP, which reduced revenues by $515 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 6% from the prior year to $6.3 billion, a new record. The decline in DCP was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation expense. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was robust at $1.6 billion and the margin increased to 28.2%. The margin resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the franchise and the benefits of our business mix, including the growth of our banking offerings. Transactional revenues were $291 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 17%. Lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last year\u2019s elevated levels and limited new issuance. Self-directed daily average trades remained well above E*TRADE\u2019s pre-acquisition high. Asset management revenues of $3.5 billion were up modestly versus the prior year driven by strong fee-based flows realized over recent quarters. Fee-based flow assets were $29 billion in the quarter and fee-based assets now represent 50% of our adviser-led assets. Total net new assets were $53 billion in the quarter bringing year-to-date NNA to $195 billion, representing a 6% annualized growth rate. Tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarters and yet asset generation remains strong and balanced. NNA was driven by existing and new clients in the adviser-led channel, stock plan vesting events, positive net recruiting and self-directed channel inflows. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion in the quarter driven by securities based lending and mortgages. We continue to expect full year loan growth of $22 billion. Deposits declined $12 billion in the quarter to $340 billion. The decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of rate-sensitive cash. The outflows were largely in line with our expectations. The average rate of deposits increased to 28 basis points. This was driven by an increase in savings account rates and deposit mix. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, up notably from the prior year, driven by higher rates and continued strong bank lending growth. Looking ahead to the second quarter, NII is now a more reasonable exit rate going forward. While the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain, if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions materialize, we estimate $500 million of incremental NII to be spread over the upcoming two quarters weighted towards the fourth quarter. Turning to Investment Management, revenues were $1.4 billion. Against the challenging public market environment, our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix, particularly with strength in our portfolio solutions led by Parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offering. We have built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments. The benefits of these efforts were apparent in the quarter. Total AUM was $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of $3.5 billion primarily reflect recurring headwinds in equity strategies that were partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions, particularly in Parametric customized portfolios. Collaboration with our Wealth Management business as well as other U.S. wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings. Liquidity net inflows exceeded $30 billion. We have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade, which has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower AUM was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as rates came off of a zero-bound. Performance-based income and other revenues were $107 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternative portfolio with particular strength in infrastructure and the energy sector investment. The decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in DCP and markdowns on public investments. Overall, our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. We have seen early success in leveraging our global distribution across our combined businesses. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets declined 4% from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs notably decreased to $461 billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses amid a market decline. The result was a reduction in RWAs of $40 billion. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of $1.1 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%. During the second quarter, we completed our $12 billion buyback plan that we announced last year. The most recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model and we announced a dividend increase of 11% and a $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization. Looking ahead, while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict, we are focused on our underlying business drivers. Lower asset values will impact revenue in both Wealth and Investment Management. However, in Wealth Management, rising rates are already driving NII higher, supporting performance and net new assets remain healthy in Investment Management. The diversification across fund strategies should continue to support results. What we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our Institutional Securities business. However, our competitive positions remains strong and we remain close to our clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment. With that, we will now open the line up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu: Thank you. Good afternoon, James I guess and then good morning Sharon. Maybe start on the macro, James, it\u2019s a very confusing time on the macro front and there are some positives but a ton of headwinds. I\u2019d also say this quarter was unusually noisy for Morgan Stanley and I think you kind of put up your lowest ROE in almost 2 years? So just curious how you are thinking about the macro backdrop, how is MS positioned for that backdrop? Maybe how you think about your pathway to achieve some of your longer term targets in the current backdrop? Thanks.\nJames Gorman: Sure. Thanks, Christian. I think you hit on the head, the environment \u2013 if I had to use one word to describe it, it would be complicated. We have the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, obviously, an historic occasion. We have historically low rates with very significant rate increases going around the world. We have got the tail of COVID. We have got obviously the fears of inflation and actual inflation. We have got enormous political change just here in this country, the UK, where I am at the moment. They had a leadership change a few days ago, supply chain issues, China-U.S. relations, etcetera, so yes, very complicated. I think it\u2019s important to say though, it is not 2008 complicated. This is a different type of financial stress in the system. And frankly, the banking sector is much stronger than it was going into the last time we went through a major reset in \u201807/08. Morgan Stanley is in particular, I won\u2019t speak for others, but we are in specifically much better shape. We are long in the U.S. in our businesses, largely because Wealth Management is almost entirely U.S. and the U.S. is yet again sort of a great region to be in, in the world. And yes, while we might head into some form of recession \u2013 and I, like many of others, have tried to handicap it, but we are frankly guessing at this stage, but I think it\u2019s unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the U.S. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how COVID rolls out, and it\u2019s sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe is obviously \u2013 is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine, because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on. So when I look at Morgan Stanley, sort of added all together, we did exactly what we wanted to do this quarter. Yes, it\u2019s the lowest ROE for a couple of years after, I think, 3 consecutive record years, but hey, this is the most difficult environment we\u2019ve been in decades. So I\u2019m okay with the lower ROE, particularly when it has a ten-handle on it. We have \u2013 CET1 capital ratio is 200 basis points above our requirement. Our ROTCE was nearly 14%. If you look at the Wealth Management margins, we did a 27% margin, including integration this quarter, 28% without it. Those numbers were unheard of a few years ago. So you add it all together, the environment, very complicated, lots of uncertainty. But frankly, for our business model, I think we fare relatively well. And evidence of that is our confidence in the future, and I\u2019m sure we will talk about that in terms of capital and so on.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Thank you, James. Maybe, Sharon, some more specifics around the buyback, just thinking about how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks in the second half of the year. I mean your CET1 did grow quarter-over-quarter, but I think a little of that was RWA declining. It looks like actually CET1 dollars are still falling \u2013 have been falling for a while. So I don\u2019t know, can you maintain the sort of $2.7 billion-ish buyback per quarter going forward or any more specifics around how long it will take to exhaust that $20 billion in buybacks you announced?\nSharon Yeshaya: Well, multiyear obviously means more than 1 year. So sort of just to put that in perspective, but I think that the most important thing about the buyback and also the capital more broadly is we\u2019ve been very prudent and efficient around our capital usage. I think that we\u2019ve always said that capital is very much tied to strategy. They are one and the same. And so we think about them holistically. When we think specifically about the buyback and the concept of a multiyear repurchase plan, right, two points: one, we did complete our old authorization. So therefore, we had announced a new authorization. And in addition to that, the point is we provide ourselves with tremendous flexibility in an environment such as this one where there are, as James said, multiple macroeconomic factors but also a commitment to continue to return capital to those shareholders, be that both in the evidenced by the increase in the dividend. And I think that what we\u2019re looking for is really \u2013 is flexibility around the capital purchase plan.\nJames Gorman: I just want to add something. I mean it was an important move to $20 billion number. And we said multiyear for a reason. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to do that in 1 year, but we have enormous flexibility quarter-to-quarter now, and that\u2019s really important. And with 200 basis points of capital access, we can use some of that flexibility. Listen, the stock trade \u2013 I don\u2019t know what it is this morning, $72 or something, it was $109 a couple of months ago. I like buying the stock at $72. And by the way, every time you buy a share at $72, your retiring dividend worth $3.10. So there is a sort of virtuous circle, if we bought back \u2013 we\u2019re averaging about 6% of shares outstanding net, we\u2019re buying back plus a 4% dividend, shareholders getting great return without getting out of bed. So this is a statement of confidence of, a, our capital position; and, b, the resilience of our business model.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks. Maybe just a follow-on on the buyback convo and broaden it out. When you look across all the big GSIBs, lots of higher \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, lots of the GSIBs, lots have higher GSIB buffers coming, capital deficiency to their targets and don\u2019t have the access that you have. So I get it, buyback cheap stock is great. Are there any other options that you ponder like maybe using that capital to grow share in any parts of the business or just save it for a rainy day, like I am curious on how that dynamic works being one of the only ones with the excess position?\nJames Gorman: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 Glenn, this is sort of the ultimate question. We\u2019ve built through a decade of, frankly, hard work and discipline, a great excess capital position. Not for nothing along the way, we did two major acquisitions. So we\u2019re using it on deals and two small ones, Solium and Mesa West, you recall, the majors, of course, E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. We\u2019ve taken the dividend. Last year, we doubled the dividend. And this year, we took it up another 11%. It wasn\u2019t so long ago, our dividend was $0.05 a quarter. The incremental change this year is $0.075 a quarter. So we\u2019ve used on that. We\u2019re investing in the business everywhere, particularly around the workplace retirement space. We\u2019ve invested in the digital bank and building out the wealth space. We\u2019ve invested in asset management and our capability, and we\u2019re going to be doing more of that, taking the Eaton Vance Funds internationally, expanding the Parametric program. And then we\u2019re investing in banking. I mean, obviously, the banking calendar has been terrible the last few months, but that\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re interested in the next 10 years, not the last few months. So the only thing we haven\u2019t done with excess capital is do a special dividend. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m just personally not a fan of. I just don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s like giving shareholders a problem and saying, we don\u2019t know what to do with their money. Here, you take it. So what we like to do with that money, invest it in the business, check; give you a smart dividend with a 4% yield, check; and do buybacks and have flexibility around it when the stock is trading. At the beginning of the year for every x dollars we spent, we\u2019ve got 4 shares retired. Now we\u2019re retiring 5 shares. I like that.\nGlenn Schorr: Cool. I appreciate all that, James. A follow-up on Wealth Management, Sharon, thank you, you gave color on new money coming into which types of accounts and new clients. I\u2019m curious, what are they doing with it? In other words, is it sitting in cash? Our cash position is higher than they usually are. What products are they going to? And then thirdly, you\u2019re the largest gatherer of alternative assets. Has this market brought any noticeable impact to that opportunity on the wealth channel? Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Let me start with the last. No, no change in opportunity. I think we continue to actually work very closely with different alternative managers as we go forward and think about \u2013 educate FAs, educate FAs, educate their clients and use that relationship to continue to create the right products for our clients, all based on education through both channels. In terms of what are they doing with that money, I think what you do see is a lot of the money ends up moving into fee-based over time, right? So look at the fact that we aggregated all these net new assets over recent quarters that first often does come into the system as cash when they are brought over. And then that cash is then deployed into various types of fee-based asset accounts. I think it\u2019s worth noting and just repeating that those fee-based assets are now 50% of our adviser-led channel and those assets, which is a big move from those somewhat 40s, low 40s that we had seen in previous years. In terms of very specifically what we\u2019ve seen over the course of the first half of this year in terms of different types of products, we were sitting at the end of the fourth quarter with cash levels at around 17% to 18% around the self-directed and the advice-based channel. We\u2019re now around 21%. Of course, that could be reflective of some of the equity asset values and the other asset values coming down to increase. But there is somewhat of \u2013 there is a pause, I think, people are waiting and observing in certain end markets to deploy that cash. And I think that, that\u2019s just \u2013 you can see that in the transactional coming down a bit and/or it\u2019s coming down a bit, but I don\u2019t want to suggest that the engagement isn\u2019t there, because we still are at levels where our engagement as thought about by the most DART metrics and just what we\u2019ve seen in transactional, it\u2019s still higher than levels where we were from a pre pandemic basis. So people are engaged, people are active, and they are seeking advice from their FAs.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Chubak: Hi, good morning. So wanted to ask a follow-up question on the deposit outlook, as you noted in the prepared remarks, just lots of crosscurrents this quarter on the deposit side, tax seasonality, cash sorting and maybe some offset from higher market volatility? And given the NII guidance, Sharon that you had laid out, I was hoping you could speak to what you\u2019re assuming for deposit betas and the deposit growth trajectory given the myopic focus on cash sorting and recognizing that you already laid out some pretty explicit guidance on the loan growth side?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think what you just noted at the very end is very important because all of this is weighted into that NII forecast, right? Deposit beta is just one piece of that conversation, the behavior and then also how we continue to build in an aggregate, be it new assets through NNA and also various types of, as you call it, cash sorting, but the movements of cash between products and that behavior of deposits. Specific to your question around the beta, as we\u2019ve said, we are informed by the last rate hike cycle, and it does have to do with the weighted beta at 50, which I had noted last quarter, and we will just reiterate again this quarter. There really has to do with the deposit composition mix that we have. So we have obviously accumulated very increased levels on those smaller accounts with smaller account levels. And we might have other accounts where we\u2019ve seen larger inflows into larger accounts, right? So account balances that are higher might also have gone up over time. And that helps to explain the deposit beta, which we see now based again, as I said, on that deposit composition mix. It will not just be, though, of course, around deposit beta. A lot that is embedded into the forecast, as I said, has to do with how we see those deposit behavior moving over time. And again, a lot of that is informed by what we saw in the last rate hike cycle.\nSteve Chubak: Very helpful color, Sharon. And maybe just a follow-up on the earlier discussion on organic growth, I mean the 4% number, which, considering the more pronounced tax seasonality, elevated market volatility, was certainly an impressive result. If the market volatility persists, should we view this as a reasonable floor on organic growth? And I was also hoping you could just speak to the cadence of flows from April to June, just to give us a sense as to how organic growth is trajecting over the course of the quarter?\nSharon Yeshaya: Well, the cadence is obviously \u2013 you\u2019re not going to \u2013 you\u2019ve seen more in the second quarter \u2013 I mean you\u2019ve seen a different mix, right, in the second 2 months than the first month because you had a tax outflow season. So that kind of gives you the change in those two numbers. I think what we have seen is a continue \u2013 you have a lot that comes in from a flow-based basis is just \u2013 if you think about workplace, you\u2019re going to see that development and continue. As people have exercised their options, they continue to move forward. So there are various types of offsets. I think what\u2019s important as we look forward, in terms of where is the floor, look, we have said historically, we don\u2019t expect to be in that very low single-digit range, which we were before the acquisition of E*TRADE. We said that 11% was too high. So that kind of gave you that middle range. Exactly how it will pan out, what I can say to you is that it does look \u2013 it\u2019s still healthy, and we\u2019re still \u2013 we still feel well positioned. As it relates specifically to other indicators that you might think about \u2013 for example, recruiting. When \u2013 recruiting pipeline remains healthy. And what we often see and tactically, anecdotally is when those recruits come over, they will be \u2013 they could be in a market volatility event actually be quicker to begin to bring those assets that were held away into the channel, why? Because they are seeking to be with their FA through that advice-led channel more immediately, so as you called it, there are cross currents. And I think they are into \u2013 bear in mind in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on Investment Management and the fee outlook, you have, obviously, beta working against you in some of your higher fee products, but you have fee waivers coming off on the money market side. So as you think about mix and client behavior going forward, how do you think about the fee rate in that business longer-term?\nSharon Yeshaya: It\u2019s a great question. I am sure you will see the disclosure also that will come out in the Q specifically for this business. But just to give you a sense, the fee rates themselves haven\u2019t changed. What changes \u2013 what has changed is the mix of the actual flows themselves. So we\u2019ve seen a decrease over the course of the last two quarters in some of those equity accounts, for example, which, as is disclosed, could be higher \u2013 can have higher fees. But what we have seen is an increase in balances. In things like liquidity, we\u2019re now not seeing the fee waivers since we\u2019ve moved off that zero-bound floor. We had given you previous guidance of $200 million that we expected to see as an incremental fee positive over the course of the year as those waivers went away because rates came off of that zero-bound. We stand behind that guidance, and you\u2019ve continued to see that flow into the numbers. I think, though, what is important is, obviously, where could you see things change, is the liquidity balances, right. It\u2019s a rate time balance question, as I said before. And the balance is in this case, I think, is a testament to the amount of time and the investment we\u2019ve put into this business to find relationships also across the integrated investment bank where we\u2019ve worked with partners in Institutional Securities, for example, to help forge relationships that will help bring in some of those deposits into those money market products.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, given the backdrop we\u2019re in where revenues are a bit more challenged or uncertain. As you think about non-comp expense, and you highlighted being focused on this area and being efficient, but have you proactively started to make decisions around spend and cutting back or as you think about that flexibility in the back half of the year, is there a way to quantify levels of growth or lack thereof and any changes?\nSharon Yeshaya: So the first point that I would highlight to you is that ex integration, our efficiency ratio is at 7%, and that includes the legal charge that James mentioned this quarter. So I think we have shown and continues to demonstrate discipline around our expense base, very similar to the way we think about capital. Resources, we think about it very holistically and part of our strategic decision-making process. As we walked into the second quarter, we were aware that the environment was changing, and we all had been seeing the same events that \u2013 we\u2019ve all witnessed together as it relates to the geopolitical front and the macro side. And we came in and we took a look \u2013 a hard look and we continue to do so, individual product by product, investment by investment, project by project to understand where are the potential growth in expenses coming from, how are we thinking about balancing, as James said, that near-term investment, making sure that we need to get on certain things. We always need to ensure that as we invest also with a longer-term horizon, the right controls are in place as we continue to grow the business efficiently, but are there projects that can be delayed that we might be doing on the margin? So I\u2019d say that, that work is in flight, has been in flight. It\u2019s not new information, and it\u2019s certainly something that we are keeping our eyes on.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi, good morning. Just one more follow-up on the Institutional Securities business. So you talked about market share opportunities, which you clearly have. Would love to hear your thoughts around just the health of, one, how is the plumbing in the capital market functioning? We saw a bunch of headlines around hung deals, et cetera, during the quarter. So just how are clients holding up on the institutional side? And given how strong the franchise already is on the Prime Brokerage side, is there more opportunity there? I realize that was a big driver of the growth this quarter. So would love to hear your thoughts?\nSharon Yeshaya: The \u2013 from \u2013 basically, in terms of the capital market functioning, as James said, this is not \u2013 we\u2019re not in a position of the same kind of stress we\u2019ve seen in other necessary cycles. We\u2019re still seeing functioning markets. You can see that in just some of the funded balance points that I made across the ISG portfolio in terms of funded balances being at 11% versus even the pandemic, we have seen those balances up to 25%. So I would certainly say that you see institutions that are in a good place. I also think from a corporate perspective, it is worth noting that many came into this from an environmental perspective in a much better position than they have before because they did issue and we\u2019re in a good spot from a balance sheet perspective in the period of low rates that you saw over the course of last year. Of course, there are days where it\u2019s more difficult to come to market. That is very clear as you see that in the underwriting results. So just to provide that balance, of course, it\u2019s not the same thing as having a green screen every single day. But I think that you are seeing both institutions and corporations, etcetera, taking advantage of days where the market is open, and they are able to do that, and from that perspective, the market is functioning. As it relates to Prime Brokerage, we have been very balanced in that business. I think we have been a tremendous leader in that business. And we continue to effectively look for the relationships that we are well suited for both in this environment that makes sense to partner with clients. You see that on the balance side. You see that on the revenue side. And you see that the mix also matters to us. And so from that perspective, we have been very focused on the equities business more holistically for over a decade now.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thanks for that. And just on the fixed income. So, appreciate that you all right-sized the business a few years ago. Like given the capital constraints at your peers, does it make sense maybe, James or Sharon, to like lean in and revisit areas where you could actually pick up share on the fixed income side or no?\nJames Gorman: Listen, there is always opportunities to an environment where you can try and pick up share. We are in a bit of an uncertain world, as I opened with. I don\u2019t think this is the time to be overly aggressive personally. I like the fact we have excess capital. I like where our CET1 ratio is. Obviously, as you drive up RWAs, you read into that. We actually brought up RWAs down by $40 billion this quarter. I think the institutional team in both fixed income and equities were very prudent and appropriately so. So, listen, if the option is to trigger another 50 basis points on the SCB or generate another, I don\u2019t know, $100 million, $200 million in revenue. That for me is a very easy call right now. I like the 50 basis points that we haven\u2019t had to trigger that some of our competitors have. So, listen, we will be eyes wide open, but we are not trying to win the game right now. There is a \u2013 the fixed income business has gone from doing, I don\u2019t know what they were doing, $500 million, $600 million a quarter in the back half of 2015. And we are consistently somewhere between $1.75 billion and $3 billion, that\u2019s \u2013 they have done a phenomenal job. They have materially gained share. I think we are around 10% share up from 6% or lower in those days, stable business, great leadership. So, yes, we will be opportunistic, but we are not going to be greedy.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Steve\u2019s questions on deposit beta, but rather talk about the balance side of things. So, the brokerage sweep deposits declined by about $30 billion this quarter. Sharon, I think you referenced that it \u2013 that was driven by both tax payments, but also some yield seeking. Could you maybe break that down a little bit, or do you have a sense about what that attribution would be, just so we can kind of level set and think about how much further potential deposit \u2013 deposit loss there could be from further yield seeking?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. I think the better \u2013 I mean I think that one quarter would be a little bit difficult to kind of draw those conclusions. I think the way I would think about it, Brennan, is a little bit differently, which is some of the questions I know we have received are, well, why didn\u2019t your beta come down because you had E*TRADE. And so those balances should be in a position where you should have an average weighted beta that\u2019s lower over time. So, I think the best way to kind of answer your question a little bit more head on in terms of where the underlying crux is, is we have seen balances also increase in the higher account level. That\u2019s built into the model. It\u2019s built into our expectations. It\u2019s built into the forecast. And we have said, as I said directly in my remarks, we also saw the deposit behavior very much in line with what we expected. And so it is working in terms of that predictability. But why is the beta then higher, some of that beta just has to do with \u2013 you have some higher balances. Why, because you accumulated them likely at periods of time where yields were lower, and there was excess cash that was sitting in position. And so some of that higher balanced amount begins to leave seeking out higher-yielding payments. So, I think that can help give you a little bit of construct in terms of what\u2019s going on from the balance perspective to more directly, I think answer the question rather than just look at one quarter\u2019s behavior.\nBrennan Hawken: Sure. Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you. And then when we think about the SBL book, you flagged the $22 billion of continued loan growth. So, it seems like you are expecting loan growth in the back half to be about half of what you saw in the first half a little more than that, but not by much. So \u2013 and it makes sense, it would slow. Can you talk about what we have seen from an LTV perspective in the SBL book and whether or not some of that slowing loan growth is going to reflect some \u2013 maybe some SBL pay-down, or is there the potential of some SBL reduction just because LTVs are getting high, and so there is going to need to be some of that just mechanically and maybe also how you manage those LTVs in these choppy market environments?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. So, the LTVs are very well managed. No, it\u2019s okay. Okay. I am just trying to remember it all. So, from the LTV perspective, as you would expect, we are very much actually in line with where we have been from historical years. And the reason for that is it is a very well-managed book. And why any uptick at all, as you would expect, obviously, the value of the underlying has gone down. But from a historical basis, we have always been within that \u2013 sort of given a 40% range or low-40% range, we are in that range, and we are very much, like I said in line over the last couple of years. Now as it relates directly to what we are looking forward and seeing, I think what\u2019s important here is that from a mortgage perspective, you might see some slowing just obviously given where rates are. Now, why would the SBLs come down, you just might not have as much interest or engagement in the product with lower asset values. So, I don\u2019t look at it in terms of, oh, there is a management issue, rather that is a very well-managed portfolio where we haven\u2019t seen issues in a lot of different market environment with the calls from an operational perspective more broadly, etcetera, but rather just the engagement from that relationship side, is this the right product to be using now. You might not have those conversations as much with the asset values coming down. So, a very practical answer to the question that you gave.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just a follow-up on the loan growth, the $20 billion loan growth target from the start of the year, it looks like you are still looking at that. But how are you thinking about loss rates on those new loans given perhaps a new economic forecast? We note that provisions for wealth losses are already tripled with the level of last year. Kind of what\u2019s the risk in that portfolio? And does it make sense to have a loan growth target? It\u2019s always easy to make loans. It\u2019s just tough to get paid back sometimes. Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. I think that the loan growth target is, I mean just in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s more of an expectation to help people understand what the NII projection is. I wouldn\u2019t call it as the target. To the point that was brought by Brennan, obviously, the expectations on a quarter-over-quarter basis has come down. So, we did see some pull forward, and that\u2019s all we are reflecting in that. As you look at the provisions themselves, they still vary on a relative basis to other provisions across various \u2013 both institutions, and even our Institutional Securities franchise is quite low. In terms of what drives that, as you know, it\u2019s all \u2013 it is based on the CECL concept, in the life of loan concept. And as you also know, it is a complicated idea between both qualitative and a quantitative scenario. For us, as we disclosed in our Q, the factors that we look at that are most important is really around GDP. We did see a degradation in the GDP expectations, very consistent with what\u2019s going on in the macroeconomic outlook. And we are expecting the recession that we have talked about, the probabilities are in the 50-50 range. And that\u2019s very consistent with also what we have said publicly.\nMike Mayo: And so did you have any extra CECL provisions this quarter?\nSharon Yeshaya: No. We are \u2013 we feel appropriately reserved for where we are right now.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, in the workplace channel, you guys had some good growth in the number of participants on a year-over-year basis, it was up 17%. The unvested asset values declined about 33%. Can you give us a little color? Was it primarily just market conditions bringing that down, or is there something else there?\nSharon Yeshaya: It\u2019s a great question and you draw a good point distinction. No, those are just the value \u2013 it\u2019s just the value of the assets themselves have gone down that those holders have. Now the increase in participants has a lot to do with the fact that we just continue \u2013 as we continue to \u2013 we mandate, we have seen that increase the number of participants. What I would say in terms of just an opportunity in terms of engaging with those clients is, obviously, it is a difficult time in environment for some of those individuals. And we do \u2013 we continue to educate and use financial wellness as a tool, especially in these environments, to explain the advice-driven model and provide us with an opportunity actually in this kind of environment to discuss what financial advice and what financial wellness is, specifically as people see different declines in their potential portfolio.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And does \u2013 do the assets skew to more new start-up companies that might be tech-orientated versus a more traditional industrial company or a stable company in those plans?\nSharon Yeshaya: Skew, there are \u2013 there is a good portion, I would say of technology companies that would be in that sector that you can see as you see those asset values declined, but there is a balance on the other side of different types of companies. And as we win mandates, it\u2019s not just on the tech side. We are winning mandates across different institutions, especially as people better understand that financial wellness offering.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Appreciate all the details on Slide 11 here, the allowance for credit losses. Maybe you have had it before, but more relevant now, and good detail. If you had to kind of guesstimate in a moderate recession that $1.2 billion of total ACL, where does that go?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that is a very difficult question to answer. I think that what you can look at and think about it is, obviously, the economic scenario makes sense. The GDP makes sense, the size of the \u2013 where the growth actually comes from and goes, and then there is some extension of duration that you can see dependent on the rate rise expectation.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Any way to frame, does it double or triple? Obviously, a lot of the loans are in Wealth Management, which is just not going to \u2013 you would think have as much loss content, but any way to frame generically how high it could go?\nJames Gorman: Yes, I would\u2026\nSharon Yeshaya: I mean you know what I would do \u2013 I would say is why don\u2019t you think about it as it relates to COVID, right. You can think about where we were from a COVID perspective. And so let\u2019s talk ISG specifically. The provisions this quarter are 82%. It was almost 4x that when you think about where we were from a COVID perspective.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nJames Gorman: I would just point out that \u2013 sorry. I would just point out that the Wealth Management piece, ACL percentage is 0.1. These are very different kinds of loans from traditional consumer banking loans. So, you are just not going to see at least for that part of a major, major move. For the others, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 you can\u2019t project. I mean who knows what kind of recession \u2013 a recession might be, how long it might be and so on. But we manage this business conservatively and we don\u2019t have a big traditional middle market, small business loan book. We just don\u2019t have that kind of business.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a clarification question, the total DCP for the firm, you mentioned $515 million revenue impact in Wealth, but what\u2019s the firm-wide revenue and expense impact, please?\nSharon Yeshaya: It\u2019s non-material per business line, which is why we don\u2019t call out the number.\nJames Gorman: The reason we called it out in Wealth, just to be clear, was Wealth actually had a great quarter, revenue growth, new money growth, fee-based growth and margins year-over-year, the same at 27% in a very difficult environment. So, we thought it was kind of raining on the party a little bit that the DCP took $500 million off the top line number, even though it comes out of the comp expense number almost dollar-for-dollar, not quite. So, that\u2019s why we called it out. Ordinarily, we wouldn\u2019t call out DCP. We don\u2019t make a big deal of it. It\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s an accounting issue. It\u2019s not a business issue. So, we are not often that excited about it. But we just thought given you would all be interested in how the retail investor was behaving right now and what was going on in that business and how panic they were, the short answer is not very, behaving well, business stable, saw growth. Hence, we want to call it out.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on the RWA decline, was that a deliberate reduction, or is that more market-driven? And if somewhat \u2013 some deliberate actions, can you kind of give us a little more clarity on what those actions were specifically and if that can continue?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. It was both is the way I would answer it. There are obviously market declines that had to do with it as well. But this was a very thoughtful use and approach around efficient uses of RWAs. And where does it make sense from a business perspective given the uncertainty, and I think there is a very \u2013 as I said, the same way when we think about the expenses, it\u2019s about being efficient and thoughtful and very prudent and flexible with all of that environment. So, it\u2019s both of those things that were taken into account when thinking about the RWA decline.\nJames Gorman: Listen, I want to make an important point here. We regard our capital ratios as sacrosanct. These are a big deal for us. We have spent a decade building them. We like having excess capital for exactly this environment we are in now. We can buy back up to $20 billion and a bunch that we are going to be doing, hopefully, in the low-70s. So, making sure we give ourselves that flexibility, demonstrating discipline in a tough environment. I think Ted and the ISG team did a phenomenal job in driving that number down. And obviously, it\u2019s driven in part by volatility in the market, so things outside of their control. But this is something that we should and will try and control as best as we can.\nJim Mitchell: Right. Maybe as a follow-up on that, James, I think you have talked about hoping the change in the mix of your business over time would push your DFAS losses and SCB down slightly. This year is probably a period of victory relative to what some happened to your peers. But do you think there is still room to see that come down over time given your changing mix?\nJames Gorman: Absolutely. Look at the PPNR number, was materially up as stress losses were also up, not surprisingly. The test was incredibly demanding in this environment. But notwithstanding that, we increased the dividend and we still came out at 13.3, I think versus 13.2. We are very focused on the SCB buffer not getting away from us. The change in business model, the growth in the asset management business, the growth in the workplace retirement business, all of these things, which frankly are very capital-friendly. Yes, that number is going to keep moving. Then we have an argument we have been \u2013 an argument I won\u2019t put it that way, but let\u2019s just say a different point of view with the Federal Reserve about how they treat financial adviser compensation during a time of stress. And we have argued for a long time that financial adviser compensation is obviously variable. So, that expense comes down when revenues come down. The Fed has not yet seen it our way, but we are continuing to push that argument strongly. When it does, we believe that will free up another bunch of capital.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. James, you have talked about variable expenses for variable revenues, and the revenues were down, and comp was down. But at what point do you pull the lever on kind of plan being? I mean you said 50-50 on a recession. And Sharon talked about maybe delaying some projects. But when it comes to resource allocation, headcount, more aggressive moves to prepare for a difficult environment, you said yourself that it\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s not the time to take too much extra risk to push your market share. But is it time to go to plan B or more recession-like scenario in terms of your resource management?\nJames Gorman: No, it\u2019s not. We are overwhelmingly in the U.S. We had 6% revenue growth in the Wealth Management business, produced ex integration 28% margins. This is a business we definitely don\u2019t want to harm in this environment. And we are managing, I mean I guess it\u2019s quasi plan B., managing the RWAs as we just said in the balance sheet, reflecting a more stressed environment. We met as a Management Committee last September, I think and I spoke to the Management Committee about I felt there was much more downside risk to the market. The magnitude of it, I didn\u2019t have a strong feeling for, but I thought it was somewhere between significant and are really significant. And I think we are in the sort of significant phase right now. So, we started pulling back, Mike, at that point. We have got a very clear handle on headcount growth and where that growth is. We have also got a lot of regulatory obligations. We have got to continue to fulfill as all the banks do. But right now, we are definitely not in a sort of crisis mode at all. I mean that\u2019s what \u2013 if we were, we wouldn\u2019t be buying back $20 billion increase in the dividend 11%. On the other hand, balance sheet growth will be very measured. I think we will pick up share by banks coming back to us, not necessarily us having to move forward. And as I think Sharon articulated very well, we are doing a pretty systematic review of the prioritization of all the projects going on around the firm and also in a big company like this with $60 billion of revenue, we have a lot of stuff going on, and we have choices as to when we do it. So, I would call it a sort of plan A minus, not a plan B, if you will, but that\u2019s mindset we are in. However, if things get worse, and in my career, I have seen a lot of recessions, a lot of crises, a lot of damage done to the environment, if things really deteriorated, particularly in the U.S., then we take a much more aggressive position. And we obviously have the ultimate weapon, which is comp.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are doing the call a little differently this time. I am in London, Sharon is in New York. So, if we have any logistical gaps for a second or two please understand, but I think we will be just fine. The firm delivered a very solid quarter against obviously what is a more challenging backdrop. Our businesses proved resilient, reflecting an important aspect of our strategy, and that is to, as we have said many times, deliver stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining well capitalized. The integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients, grow assets and support the firm's overall stability. Net new assets in Wealth Management of over $50 billion, despite the volatility and clients tax-related withdrawals in the quarter, underscored the scale of our business and its power to attract assets. And in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets, Wealth Management delivered a strong PBT and improved margin supported by the benefits of rising rates. Investment Management benefited from its diversification and we saw continued momentum in private alternatives, parametric customized portfolios and the countercyclicality of our money market business. Finally, in Institutional Securities, our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helps materially counter what everybody knows to be limited activity across Investment Banking. Our results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out. First, we saw a significant movement in the investments related to deferred cash based compensation plans. While the marks on these investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense, they created significant drag on top line revenues in the quarter across the firm, particularly in Wealth Management, where the impact of revenues exceeded $500 million. Secondly, the quarter results also included the legal costs of $200 million that reflects the likely resolution of regulatory investigations by the SEC and the CFTC regarding employees' use of unapproved personal devices and the firm's recordkeeping requirements. This has been the subject of industry-wide scrutiny. Our ROTCE, excluding integration expenses for the deals that we have done, was 14.3%, down 20% in Q1 and from last year. As I said at the outset, our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic cycle was achieved this quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance in what was otherwise a challenging environment. Finally, the Fed stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model. Our diversified business mix, as well as our strong capital position, provides us the flexibility to invest for future growth and support our robust capital return program. As such, we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and announced a $20 billion multiyear buyback program. Having a dividend that's aligned to the more stable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management is a leading priority of this firm. And by the way, today's stock price, the current dividend has a yield of approximately 4%. With the buyback, we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows. Given the nature of our business model, it's especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital at what we believe to be attractive valuations. I will now turn the call over to Sharon. And as always, at the end, we will take your questions. Sure. Thanks, Christian. I think you hit on the head, the environment \u2013 if I had to use one word to describe it, it would be complicated. We have the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, obviously, an historic occasion. We have historically low rates with very significant rate increases going around the world. We have got the tail of COVID. We have got obviously the fears of inflation and actual inflation. We have got enormous political change just here in this country, the UK, where I am at the moment. They had a leadership change a few days ago, supply chain issues, China-U.S. relations, etcetera, so yes, very complicated. I think it's important to say though, it is not 2008 complicated. This is a different type of financial stress in the system. And frankly, the banking sector is much stronger than it was going into the last time we went through a major reset in \u201807/08. Morgan Stanley is in particular, I won't speak for others, but we are in specifically much better shape. We are long in the U.S. in our businesses, largely because Wealth Management is almost entirely U.S. and the U.S. is yet again sort of a great region to be in, in the world. And yes, while we might head into some form of recession \u2013 and I, like many of others, have tried to handicap it, but we are frankly guessing at this stage, but I think it's unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the U.S. I think Asia is a little behind. It depends how COVID rolls out, and it's sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries. And then Europe is obviously \u2013 is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the Ukraine, because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on. So when I look at Morgan Stanley, sort of added all together, we did exactly what we wanted to do this quarter. Yes, it's the lowest ROE for a couple of years after, I think, 3 consecutive record years, but hey, this is the most difficult environment we've been in decades. So I'm okay with the lower ROE, particularly when it has a ten-handle on it. We have \u2013 CET1 capital ratio is 200 basis points above our requirement. Our ROTCE was nearly 14%. If you look at the Wealth Management margins, we did a 27% margin, including integration this quarter, 28% without it. Those numbers were unheard of a few years ago. So you add it all together, the environment, very complicated, lots of uncertainty. But frankly, for our business model, I think we fare relatively well. And evidence of that is our confidence in the future, and I'm sure we will talk about that in terms of capital and so on. I just want to add something. I mean it was an important move to $20 billion number. And we said multiyear for a reason. Obviously, we're not going to do that in 1 year, but we have enormous flexibility quarter-to-quarter now, and that's really important. And with 200 basis points of capital access, we can use some of that flexibility. Listen, the stock trade \u2013 I don't know what it is this morning, $72 or something, it was $109 a couple of months ago. I like buying the stock at $72. And by the way, every time you buy a share at $72, your retiring dividend worth $3.10. So there is a sort of virtuous circle, if we bought back \u2013 we're averaging about 6% of shares outstanding net, we're buying back plus a 4% dividend, shareholders getting great return without getting out of bed. So this is a statement of confidence of, a, our capital position; and, b, the resilience of our business model. Well, it's \u2013 Glenn, this is sort of the ultimate question. We've built through a decade of, frankly, hard work and discipline, a great excess capital position. Not for nothing along the way, we did two major acquisitions. So we're using it on deals and two small ones, Solium and Mesa West, you recall, the majors, of course, E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. We've taken the dividend. Last year, we doubled the dividend. And this year, we took it up another 11%. It wasn't so long ago, our dividend was $0.05 a quarter. The incremental change this year is $0.075 a quarter. So we've used on that. We're investing in the business everywhere, particularly around the workplace retirement space. We've invested in the digital bank and building out the wealth space. We've invested in asset management and our capability, and we're going to be doing more of that, taking the Eaton Vance Funds internationally, expanding the Parametric program. And then we're investing in banking. I mean, obviously, the banking calendar has been terrible the last few months, but that's not \u2013 we're interested in the next 10 years, not the last few months. So the only thing we haven't done with excess capital is do a special dividend. And that's something I'm just personally not a fan of. I just don't \u2013 I think it's like giving shareholders a problem and saying, we don't know what to do with their money. Here, you take it. So what we like to do with that money, invest it in the business, check; give you a smart dividend with a 4% yield, check; and do buybacks and have flexibility around it when the stock is trading. At the beginning of the year for every x dollars we spent, we've got 4 shares retired. Now we're retiring 5 shares. I like that. Listen, there is always opportunities to an environment where you can try and pick up share. We are in a bit of an uncertain world, as I opened with. I don't think this is the time to be overly aggressive personally. I like the fact we have excess capital. I like where our CET1 ratio is. Obviously, as you drive up RWAs, you read into that. We actually brought up RWAs down by $40 billion this quarter. I think the institutional team in both fixed income and equities were very prudent and appropriately so. So, listen, if the option is to trigger another 50 basis points on the SCB or generate another, I don't know, $100 million, $200 million in revenue. That for me is a very easy call right now. I like the 50 basis points that we haven't had to trigger that some of our competitors have. So, listen, we will be eyes wide open, but we are not trying to win the game right now. There is a \u2013 the fixed income business has gone from doing, I don't know what they were doing, $500 million, $600 million a quarter in the back half of 2015. And we are consistently somewhere between $1.75 billion and $3 billion, that's \u2013 they have done a phenomenal job. They have materially gained share. I think we are around 10% share up from 6% or lower in those days, stable business, great leadership. So, yes, we will be opportunistic, but we are not going to be greedy. Yes, I would... I would just point out that \u2013 sorry. I would just point out that the Wealth Management piece, ACL percentage is 0.1. These are very different kinds of loans from traditional consumer banking loans. So, you are just not going to see at least for that part of a major, major move. For the others, I think it's just \u2013 you can't project. I mean who knows what kind of recession \u2013 a recession might be, how long it might be and so on. But we manage this business conservatively and we don't have a big traditional middle market, small business loan book. We just don't have that kind of business. The reason we called it out in Wealth, just to be clear, was Wealth actually had a great quarter, revenue growth, new money growth, fee-based growth and margins year-over-year, the same at 27% in a very difficult environment. So, we thought it was kind of raining on the party a little bit that the DCP took $500 million off the top line number, even though it comes out of the comp expense number almost dollar-for-dollar, not quite.

Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.44 and our ROTCE was 14.3%. Our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against a challenging backdrop and the benefits of a balanced business model. The integrated investment bank continues to serve clients' evolving needs in a dynamic environment. Wealth Management benefited from its scale and rising rates. Despite the decline in global asset prices, our expanded product set in Investment Management proved supportive to that business. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses, was 70%. This includes the $200 million legal matter related to the firm's recordkeeping requirements that James discussed. Given the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment, we are focused on discretionary spend while balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth. As a management team, our priority is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. We will continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective. Now to the businesses, institutional revenue of over $6 billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise against the difficult market backdrop. Revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year, while the backdrop was challenging for Investment Banking, particularly underwriting, fixed income and equities led the strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets. Investment Banking revenues were $1.1 billion, down significantly from the prior year. Heightened volatility led clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity. Advisory revenues were $598 million, reflecting lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues declined to $148 million. Results were in line with global equity volumes, which fell meaningfully versus the prior year. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $326 million, also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investment grade and non-investment-grade companies. The Investment Banking pipeline remains solid. Conversion to realize will largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $3 billion, reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop. Prime brokerage revenue... [Technical Difficulty] Our revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of $413 million. Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held-for-sale including event loans offset by gains on hedges were $282 million. This reflected the widening of credit spreads. Notable declines in deferred-based \u2013 in deferred cash-based compensation plans compared to gains in the prior year also contributed to the decline. Turning to ISG lending, as a reminder, over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment grade or secured. Our Institutional Securities Group credit portfolio continues to perform well. Our funded ratio on corporate loans stands at approximately 11%, in line with pre-pandemic levels and well below the first quarter 2020 peak of approximately 25%. Turning to Wealth Management, by several measures, performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop. We reported revenues of $5.7 billion. Results were meaningfully impacted by movements in DCP, which reduced revenues by $515 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues increased 6% from the prior year to $6.3 billion, a new record. The decline in DCP was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation expense. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was robust at $1.6 billion and the margin increased to 28.2%. The margin resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the franchise and the benefits of our business mix, including the growth of our banking offerings. Transactional revenues were $291 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 17%. Lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last year's elevated levels and limited new issuance. Self-directed daily average trades remained well above E*TRADE's pre-acquisition high. Asset management revenues of $3.5 billion were up modestly versus the prior year driven by strong fee-based flows realized over recent quarters. Fee-based flow assets were $29 billion in the quarter and fee-based assets now represent 50% of our adviser-led assets. Total net new assets were $53 billion in the quarter bringing year-to-date NNA to $195 billion, representing a 6% annualized growth rate. Tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarters and yet asset generation remains strong and balanced. NNA was driven by existing and new clients in the adviser-led channel, stock plan vesting events, positive net recruiting and self-directed channel inflows. Bank lending balances grew $7 billion in the quarter driven by securities based lending and mortgages. We continue to expect full year loan growth of $22 billion. Deposits declined $12 billion in the quarter to $340 billion. The decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of rate-sensitive cash. The outflows were largely in line with our expectations. The average rate of deposits increased to 28 basis points. This was driven by an increase in savings account rates and deposit mix. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, up notably from the prior year, driven by higher rates and continued strong bank lending growth. Looking ahead to the second quarter, NII is now a more reasonable exit rate going forward. While the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain, if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions materialize, we estimate $500 million of incremental NII to be spread over the upcoming two quarters weighted towards the fourth quarter. Turning to Investment Management, revenues were $1.4 billion. Against the challenging public market environment, our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix, particularly with strength in our portfolio solutions led by Parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offering. We have built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments. The benefits of these efforts were apparent in the quarter. Total AUM was $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of $3.5 billion primarily reflect recurring headwinds in equity strategies that were partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions, particularly in Parametric customized portfolios. Collaboration with our Wealth Management business as well as other U.S. wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings. Liquidity net inflows exceeded $30 billion. We have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade, which has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion. The impact of lower AUM was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as rates came off of a zero-bound. Performance-based income and other revenues were $107 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternative portfolio with particular strength in infrastructure and the energy sector investment. The decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in DCP and markdowns on public investments. Overall, our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. We have seen early success in leveraging our global distribution across our combined businesses. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets declined 4% from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 70 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs notably decreased to $461 billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses amid a market decline. The result was a reduction in RWAs of $40 billion. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of $1.1 billion. While this should be earned back over time, it reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.4%. During the second quarter, we completed our $12 billion buyback plan that we announced last year. The most recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model and we announced a dividend increase of 11% and a $20 billion multiyear repurchase authorization. Looking ahead, while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict, we are focused on our underlying business drivers. Lower asset values will impact revenue in both Wealth and Investment Management. However, in Wealth Management, rising rates are already driving NII higher, supporting performance and net new assets remain healthy in Investment Management. The diversification across fund strategies should continue to support results. What we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our Institutional Securities business. However, our competitive positions remains strong and we remain close to our clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment. With that, we will now open the line up for questions. Well, multiyear obviously means more than 1 year. So sort of just to put that in perspective, but I think that the most important thing about the buyback and also the capital more broadly is we've been very prudent and efficient around our capital usage. I think that we've always said that capital is very much tied to strategy. They are one and the same. And so we think about them holistically. When we think specifically about the buyback and the concept of a multiyear repurchase plan, right, two points: one, we did complete our old authorization. So therefore, we had announced a new authorization. And in addition to that, the point is we provide ourselves with tremendous flexibility in an environment such as this one where there are, as James said, multiple macroeconomic factors but also a commitment to continue to return capital to those shareholders, be that both in the evidenced by the increase in the dividend. And I think that what we're looking for is really \u2013 is flexibility around the capital purchase plan. Sure. Let me start with the last. No, no change in opportunity. I think we continue to actually work very closely with different alternative managers as we go forward and think about \u2013 educate FAs, educate FAs, educate their clients and use that relationship to continue to create the right products for our clients, all based on education through both channels. In terms of what are they doing with that money, I think what you do see is a lot of the money ends up moving into fee-based over time, right? So look at the fact that we aggregated all these net new assets over recent quarters that first often does come into the system as cash when they are brought over. And then that cash is then deployed into various types of fee-based asset accounts. I think it's worth noting and just repeating that those fee-based assets are now 50% of our adviser-led channel and those assets, which is a big move from those somewhat 40s, low 40s that we had seen in previous years. In terms of very specifically what we've seen over the course of the first half of this year in terms of different types of products, we were sitting at the end of the fourth quarter with cash levels at around 17% to 18% around the self-directed and the advice-based channel. We're now around 21%. Of course, that could be reflective of some of the equity asset values and the other asset values coming down to increase. But there is somewhat of \u2013 there is a pause, I think, people are waiting and observing in certain end markets to deploy that cash. And I think that, that's just \u2013 you can see that in the transactional coming down a bit and/or it's coming down a bit, but I don't want to suggest that the engagement isn't there, because we still are at levels where our engagement as thought about by the most DART metrics and just what we've seen in transactional, it's still higher than levels where we were from a pre pandemic basis. So people are engaged, people are active, and they are seeking advice from their FAs. I think what you just noted at the very end is very important because all of this is weighted into that NII forecast, right? Deposit beta is just one piece of that conversation, the behavior and then also how we continue to build in an aggregate, be it new assets through NNA and also various types of, as you call it, cash sorting, but the movements of cash between products and that behavior of deposits. Specific to your question around the beta, as we've said, we are informed by the last rate hike cycle, and it does have to do with the weighted beta at 50, which I had noted last quarter, and we will just reiterate again this quarter. There really has to do with the deposit composition mix that we have. So we have obviously accumulated very increased levels on those smaller accounts with smaller account levels. And we might have other accounts where we've seen larger inflows into larger accounts, right? So account balances that are higher might also have gone up over time. And that helps to explain the deposit beta, which we see now based again, as I said, on that deposit composition mix. It will not just be, though, of course, around deposit beta. A lot that is embedded into the forecast, as I said, has to do with how we see those deposit behavior moving over time. And again, a lot of that is informed by what we saw in the last rate hike cycle. Well, the cadence is obviously \u2013 you're not going to \u2013 you've seen more in the second quarter \u2013 I mean you've seen a different mix, right, in the second 2 months than the first month because you had a tax outflow season. So that kind of gives you the change in those two numbers. I think what we have seen is a continue \u2013 you have a lot that comes in from a flow-based basis is just \u2013 if you think about workplace, you're going to see that development and continue. As people have exercised their options, they continue to move forward. So there are various types of offsets. I think what's important as we look forward, in terms of where is the floor, look, we have said historically, we don't expect to be in that very low single-digit range, which we were before the acquisition of E*TRADE. We said that 11% was too high. So that kind of gave you that middle range. Exactly how it will pan out, what I can say to you is that it does look \u2013 it's still healthy, and we're still \u2013 we still feel well positioned. As it relates specifically to other indicators that you might think about \u2013 for example, recruiting. When \u2013 recruiting pipeline remains healthy. And what we often see and tactically, anecdotally is when those recruits come over, they will be \u2013 they could be in a market volatility event actually be quicker to begin to bring those assets that were held away into the channel, why? Because they are seeking to be with their FA through that advice-led channel more immediately, so as you called it, there are cross currents. And I think they are into \u2013 bear in mind in this environment. It's a great question. I am sure you will see the disclosure also that will come out in the Q specifically for this business. But just to give you a sense, the fee rates themselves haven't changed. What changes \u2013 what has changed is the mix of the actual flows themselves. So we've seen a decrease over the course of the last two quarters in some of those equity accounts, for example, which, as is disclosed, could be higher \u2013 can have higher fees. But what we have seen is an increase in balances. In things like liquidity, we're now not seeing the fee waivers since we've moved off that zero-bound floor. We had given you previous guidance of $200 million that we expected to see as an incremental fee positive over the course of the year as those waivers went away because rates came off of that zero-bound. We stand behind that guidance, and you've continued to see that flow into the numbers. I think, though, what is important is, obviously, where could you see things change, is the liquidity balances, right. It's a rate time balance question, as I said before. And the balance is in this case, I think, is a testament to the amount of time and the investment we've put into this business to find relationships also across the integrated investment bank where we've worked with partners in Institutional Securities, for example, to help forge relationships that will help bring in some of those deposits into those money market products. So the first point that I would highlight to you is that ex integration, our efficiency ratio is at 7%, and that includes the legal charge that James mentioned this quarter. So I think we have shown and continues to demonstrate discipline around our expense base, very similar to the way we think about capital. Resources, we think about it very holistically and part of our strategic decision-making process. As we walked into the second quarter, we were aware that the environment was changing, and we all had been seeing the same events that \u2013 we've all witnessed together as it relates to the geopolitical front and the macro side. And we came in and we took a look \u2013 a hard look and we continue to do so, individual product by product, investment by investment, project by project to understand where are the potential growth in expenses coming from, how are we thinking about balancing, as James said, that near-term investment, making sure that we need to get on certain things. We always need to ensure that as we invest also with a longer-term horizon, the right controls are in place as we continue to grow the business efficiently, but are there projects that can be delayed that we might be doing on the margin? So I'd say that, that work is in flight, has been in flight. It's not new information, and it's certainly something that we are keeping our eyes on. The \u2013 from \u2013 basically, in terms of the capital market functioning, as James said, this is not \u2013 we're not in a position of the same kind of stress we've seen in other necessary cycles. We're still seeing functioning markets. You can see that in just some of the funded balance points that I made across the ISG portfolio in terms of funded balances being at 11% versus even the pandemic, we have seen those balances up to 25%. So I would certainly say that you see institutions that are in a good place. I also think from a corporate perspective, it is worth noting that many came into this from an environmental perspective in a much better position than they have before because they did issue and we're in a good spot from a balance sheet perspective in the period of low rates that you saw over the course of last year. Of course, there are days where it's more difficult to come to market. That is very clear as you see that in the underwriting results. So just to provide that balance, of course, it's not the same thing as having a green screen every single day. But I think that you are seeing both institutions and corporations, etcetera, taking advantage of days where the market is open, and they are able to do that, and from that perspective, the market is functioning. As it relates to Prime Brokerage, we have been very balanced in that business. I think we have been a tremendous leader in that business. And we continue to effectively look for the relationships that we are well suited for both in this environment that makes sense to partner with clients. You see that on the balance side. You see that on the revenue side. And you see that the mix also matters to us. And so from that perspective, we have been very focused on the equities business more holistically for over a decade now. Yes. I think the better \u2013 I mean I think that one quarter would be a little bit difficult to kind of draw those conclusions. I think the way I would think about it, Brennan, is a little bit differently, which is some of the questions I know we have received are, well, why didn't your beta come down because you had E*TRADE. And so those balances should be in a position where you should have an average weighted beta that's lower over time. So, I think the best way to kind of answer your question a little bit more head on in terms of where the underlying crux is, is we have seen balances also increase in the higher account level. That's built into the model. It's built into our expectations. It's built into the forecast. And we have said, as I said directly in my remarks, we also saw the deposit behavior very much in line with what we expected. And so it is working in terms of that predictability. But why is the beta then higher, some of that beta just has to do with \u2013 you have some higher balances. Why, because you accumulated them likely at periods of time where yields were lower, and there was excess cash that was sitting in position. And so some of that higher balanced amount begins to leave seeking out higher-yielding payments. So, I think that can help give you a little bit of construct in terms of what's going on from the balance perspective to more directly, I think answer the question rather than just look at one quarter's behavior. Yes. So, the LTVs are very well managed. No, it's okay. Okay. I am just trying to remember it all. So, from the LTV perspective, as you would expect, we are very much actually in line with where we have been from historical years. And the reason for that is it is a very well-managed book. And why any uptick at all, as you would expect, obviously, the value of the underlying has gone down. But from a historical basis, we have always been within that \u2013 sort of given a 40% range or low-40% range, we are in that range, and we are very much, like I said in line over the last couple of years. Now as it relates directly to what we are looking forward and seeing, I think what's important here is that from a mortgage perspective, you might see some slowing just obviously given where rates are. Now, why would the SBLs come down, you just might not have as much interest or engagement in the product with lower asset values. So, I don't look at it in terms of, oh, there is a management issue, rather that is a very well-managed portfolio where we haven't seen issues in a lot of different market environment with the calls from an operational perspective more broadly, etcetera, but rather just the engagement from that relationship side, is this the right product to be using now. You might not have those conversations as much with the asset values coming down. So, a very practical answer to the question that you gave. Yes. I think that the loan growth target is, I mean just in terms of \u2013 it's more of an expectation to help people understand what the NII projection is. I wouldn't call it as the target. To the point that was brought by Brennan, obviously, the expectations on a quarter-over-quarter basis has come down. So, we did see some pull forward, and that's all we are reflecting in that. As you look at the provisions themselves, they still vary on a relative basis to other provisions across various \u2013 both institutions, and even our Institutional Securities franchise is quite low. In terms of what drives that, as you know, it's all \u2013 it is based on the CECL concept, in the life of loan concept. And as you also know, it is a complicated idea between both qualitative and a quantitative scenario. For us, as we disclosed in our Q, the factors that we look at that are most important is really around GDP. We did see a degradation in the GDP expectations, very consistent with what's going on in the macroeconomic outlook. And we are expecting the recession that we have talked about, the probabilities are in the 50-50 range. And that's very consistent with also what we have said publicly. No. We are \u2013 we feel appropriately reserved for where we are right now. It's a great question and you draw a good point distinction. No, those are just the value \u2013 it's just the value of the assets themselves have gone down that those holders have. Now the increase in participants has a lot to do with the fact that we just continue \u2013 as we continue to \u2013 we mandate, we have seen that increase the number of participants. What I would say in terms of just an opportunity in terms of engaging with those clients is, obviously, it is a difficult time in environment for some of those individuals. And we do \u2013 we continue to educate and use financial wellness as a tool, especially in these environments, to explain the advice-driven model and provide us with an opportunity actually in this kind of environment to discuss what financial advice and what financial wellness is, specifically as people see different declines in their potential portfolio. Skew, there are \u2013 there is a good portion, I would say of technology companies that would be in that sector that you can see as you see those asset values declined, but there is a balance on the other side of different types of companies. And as we win mandates, it's not just on the tech side. We are winning mandates across different institutions, especially as people better understand that financial wellness offering. I think that is a very difficult question to answer. I think that what you can look at and think about it is, obviously, the economic scenario makes sense. The GDP makes sense, the size of the \u2013 where the growth actually comes from and goes, and then there is some extension of duration that you can see dependent on the rate rise expectation. I mean you know what I would do \u2013 I would say is why don't you think about it as it relates to COVID, right. You can think about where we were from a COVID perspective. And so let's talk ISG specifically. The provisions this quarter are 82%. It was almost 4x that when you think about where we were from a COVID perspective. It's non-material per business line, which is why we don't call out the number. Yes. It was both is the way I would answer it. There are obviously market declines that had to do with it as well. But this was a very thoughtful use and approach around efficient uses of RWAs. And where does it make sense from a business perspective given the uncertainty, and I think there is a very \u2013 as I said, the same way when we think about the expenses, it's about being efficient and thoughtful and very prudent and flexible with all of that environment. So, it's both of those things that were taken into account when thinking about the RWA decline."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know you have a very, very busy morning, so we did our best to keep these earnings uncomplicated for you. Heading into 2022, we anticipate, as everybody did, a more volatile market, and obviously, we saw that in the first quarter. The year started with rising inflationary pressures, accelerated expectations for tightening of monetary policy, and most notably, and sadly, the invasion of Ukraine. This backdrop injected significant uncertainty into the markets and further tested resiliency of our franchise. Against this quickly evolving market environment, our diversified business model again generated high returns. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion and a ROTCE of 20%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter results continued to exemplify Morgan Stanley\u2019s strength and affirm our long-term strategy. First, Institutional Securities delivered another very strong quarter, with revenues of $7.7 billion, making it one of its highest performances ever. Compared to last year\u2019s record first quarter, we saw a different mix of businesses driving the strength of this segment. While underwriting was muted, Advisory was a highlight. Equity and fixed income again delivered exceptional results, particularly in Asia and Europe, as we supported our global clients amid a turbulent backdrop. Global balanced Institutional businesses are complex. They require many years to build and an enormous amount invested in human capital. The breadth and depth of our franchise today is a competitive differentiator. Wealth Management showcased its resiliency in the quarter. Notwithstanding, fluctuating market levels, the business generated a margin of approximately 28% excluding integration-related expenses. The E*TRADE integration continues to go very well, and given the current path we are on, a significant portion of the integration will be done by the end of this year. By the end of 2022, we expect to no longer separate our integration expenses. Net new assets for the quarter were $142 billion. That included an asset acquisition. Nonetheless, organic growth in our existing business remained very strong. In a volatile market, this is very affirming of the model. Further, we saw our first rate hike in the year in the first quarter, and with our strong and growing deposit base, this will have a near immediate economic impact to our business and it supports our path to delivering the margins that we projected in excess of 30%. In Investment Management, the increased diversification of the business supported results in a very choppy market. Fee based asset management revenues, which were $1.4 billion in the quarter, have grown with the addition of Parametric, Calvert and the broadening of our alts and fixed income platforms. We have performed better with these franchises than we would have without it and it has brought much more balance to our asset management business. And with respect to the Eaton Vance integration, it progresses very smoothly as well. The teams remain stable, and culturally, it\u2019s a terrific fit. Our markets continue to evolve, we remain confident about our position and the many opportunities ahead. Finally, a brief word on the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. In managing a global business, particularly a market-based global business, we must always remain vigilant about the potential for shocks or unexpected events. Obviously, the invasion of the Ukraine is one such event. First of all, and most importantly, our hearts go out to the Ukrainians and all those have been impacted. As it relates to the business, apart from the volatility it\u2019s created, there\u2019s been very limited financial impact to Morgan Stanley. A few years ago, we decided to give up our banking license and we significantly scaled back operations in Russia. Further, as a result of these actions and the current war, we are not entering into any new business in the country and our activities are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations. I am very proud of how our team has managed through a difficult market backdrop, and going forward, we continue to navigate the turbulent markets and broader geopolitical environment with confidence. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and together we will take your questions.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the first quarter, representing the second highest quarter in our firm\u2019s history. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.06 and our ROTCE was 20.3%. The firm\u2019s first quarter efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses was 67.9% and reflects our expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the businesses. Results of the first quarter illustrate resiliency and durability. Equity and fixed income supported our clients, while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management proved resilient and Investment Management benefited from diversification. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $7.7 billion represented the third highest quarter on record. Results declined 11% from the record set in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s performance again demonstrated the power of our global integrated investment bank, with balance across businesses and a strong presence across geographies. We remain a global diversified leader. Europe delivered its best quarter in over a decade, while Asia saw its second highest result, with strength in both equities and fixed income. Investment Banking revenues grew $1.6 Billion, led by strength in Advisory. Compared to the prior year, revenues declined by 37%. Advisory revenues were $944 million, almost double the prior year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting higher completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $258 million, a meaningful decline from last year\u2019s elevated results, in line with market volumes. Heightened volatility led clients to delay issuance activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $432 million, down compared to the prior year as macroeconomic conditions contributed to lower bond issuances. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. However, the conversion from pipeline to realize will be largely dependent on market conditions going forward. Equity revenues were $3.2 billion, reflecting broad-based strength in performance against the backdrop of volatile markets. We continue to be a global leader in this business. Cash revenues were solid, with particular strength in Europe, consistent with market volumes by geography. Derivative revenues were robust and the business navigated the volatility well. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, while intra-quarter balances were impacted by uncertainty, we saw balances rebound alongside markets. Fixed income revenues of $2.9 billion were in line with the very strong prior year. In the quarter, commodities and macro, particularly foreign exchange led the strength. Macro revenues increased meaningfully from the prior quarter. Clients remained engaged and the trading environment proved constructive. Micro results were strong, but reflected lower revenues compared to the prior year. Commodities delivered a more diversified results, with revenues notably higher than the previous first quarter, benefiting from the heightened levels of activity. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $5.9 billion. Declines in DCP negatively impacted the revenues by approximately $300 million. Excluding the impact related to DCP, revenues increased 6% versus the prior year\u2019s first quarter results. Results underscore the resilience of the franchise, the value offered to clients during uncertain times and the benefits of our scaled multi-channel model. Retail clients remained invested, with allocations across asset classes consistent with last year. PBT was $1.6 billion and the margin was 26.5% or 27.8%, excluding integration-related expenses. These strong results should continue to be supported, as we realize the benefits of rising rates. Asset management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 14% versus last year, benefiting from the growth in fee-based assets. This growth continues to reflect the investments we have made into the business over time and affirms our strategy is working. Net new assets were $142 billion for the quarter. NNA was inclusive of an asset acquisition, which I will touch on shortly. Absent this asset acquisition, annualized growth was 5.4%, and despite the volatility, net new assets were generated from all channels. The advisor-led channel benefited from an even split of existing and new clients, as well as positive net recruiting. Fee-based flows were also strong and inclusive of the asset acquisition were $97 billion. Workplace continues to benefit from the establishment of companion accounts. Retention of assets also continued to rise as a result of incremental companion account adoption and the value of the platform. In the quarter, we added $75 billion of retirement assets through an asset acquisition of our institutional retirement -- of an institutional retirement consultant. We remain a platform of choice and this is the second institutional retirement plan to join us in the last nine months. We continue to view these asset acquisitions as incremental opportunities to reach the expanded audience through education and financial wellness. The acquired team\u2019s client base includes nearly one million of plan participants. Transactional revenues were $635 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, which is reflected in this line revenues were strong. Although activity moderated from the prior year, self-directed daily average trades remained above $1 million in the quarter, over 3 times E*TRADE pre-asset acquisition record. We have also seen meaningful interest in our alternatives offering, given our broad-based access to managers and their retail-oriented products. Loan growth remained strong in the quarter, with bank lending balances growing $7 billion, driven by securities-based lending and mortgages. We expect loan growth over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $5 billion per quarter. Deposits increased $6 billion in the quarter to $352 billion. The average rate on deposits declined to 9 basis points. We have completed the net runoff in wholesale deposits and do not anticipate further declines in deposit costs. Net interest income was $1.5 billion. Excluding prepayment amortization, NII increased 15% from the prior year driven by loan growth. Back in January, we indicated that the fourth quarter NII was a reasonable base to inform 2022 and that we would expect $500 million of incremental NII on the back of rising rates. Due to the further moves in rate expectations since January, we should see this benefit at least double if the forward curve and our modeled assumptions are realized over the remaining nine months of the year. Moving to Investment Management. My remarks will refer to quarter-over-quarter changes as the timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.3 billion. The sequential decline reflects the seasonally lower performance fees, which are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter and a more challenging market environment. Despite headwinds, this business is benefiting from increased scale and a more diversified product offering. Total AUM of $1.4 trillion declined 8% quarter-over-quarter as a result of market declines and outflows. Long-term net outflows reflected approximately $9 billion of institutional outflows in our Solutions business, including the expected redemption of a large asset manager who brought their equity trading implementation in-house. Equity strategies saw a giveback of some of the prior year\u2019s asset appreciation, as the broader market experienced a rotation out of growth. This was partially offset by the continued strong flows into Parametric customized portfolios, as well as our inflation-related and interest rate-sensitive products. Asset management and related fees decreased sequentially to $1.4 billion on the back of the aforementioned seasonality and market volatility. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $53 million in the quarter, driven by markdowns in one of the Asia private equity funds. Declines in deferred compensation plan investments and negative marks associated with legacy international real estate investments. Away from these specific markdowns, we saw broad-based gains across our alternatives platform, reflecting the strength and diversity of the platform. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio sequentially declined and now stands at 14.5%. Multiple factors contributed to this change. Standardized RWAs increased as client activity returned after the more moderated levels at the end of 2021 and volatility increased. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of an unrealized loss of $2.4 billion as a result of higher interest rates. While this should earn back over time, it impacted our CET1 ratio by 50 basis points in the quarter. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, as we repurchased $2.9 billion of stock in the quarter. We remain in a strong capital position. Our tax rate was 19% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based compensation and the share-based award conversions takes place in the first quarter creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in line with full year 2021. The first quarter again tested the resiliency of our franchise. We are pleased with how our team navigated the volatile environment and stayed close to clients during times of uncertainty. While the outlook for the remainder of the year is difficult to predict, the second quarter has started constructively and clients remain engaged. With that, we will now open up the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. Maybe just to start off big picture, so putting up a 20% ROTCE in this tape, I am sure it is good performance and it is affirmation of the strategy and what you built. So my question is, you have enough capital, you have a lot of earnings power, rates are going up. I am curious how you think about -- is there what\u2019s next, I mean, what do you do with this higher earnings production with all the capital that\u2019s being produced, do you continue to chip away and find bolt-on acquisitions? Are you thinking about a next act, I mean, organic growth alone can power this, but I am just curious in the next couple of years how you are thinking about that, James?\nJames Gorman: Glenn, it\u2019s a high class problem and its great position to be in. We have been very protective of keeping a sort of buffer on a buffer, because you never know in this world and I think what we have experienced with the markets in the last quarter were extremely volatile and you just have to -- you have to anticipate the worst and make sure you are prepared for that. We clearly have done that. We have been chipping away at the excess capital. If you add back the OCI, we are running about 15% CET1. We were well above 16%. So, clearly, we will see where our CCAR results are. I think last year, they are around 13.2% or 13.3%. I\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s material changes. But let\u2019s see. So we are still sitting on a significant buffer. Listen, we are clearly going to keep pushing capital distribution through buyback and dividend to shareholders. That\u2019s clearly the case. We have just done two major acquisitions with about $21 billion. We would do more deals if as they -- if they fit with our strategy, we won\u2019t do things that take us offline, off piece. We want to stay true to our strategy and our strengths in our three core businesses. So, yeah, continued buyback, but also a lot of investment in the business. I mean, we are doing a lot on the tech side. Obviously, we want to stay completely compliant with our regulatory responsibilities and we will continue to invest to make sure we are best-in-class there. But a lot of investment technology and a lot of investment around the retirement workplace platform, which I think is sort of the next frontier. And we are just in baby steps, we are very early days of that, but I think that\u2019s a huge opportunity. And finally, I do think that there are opportunities outside of the U.S., even though we are along the US and that served us incredibly well, and I think, will serve us very well for the next decade. But I think in the Wealth and Asset Management spaces internationally, we punch below our weight. On Institutional Securities we don\u2019t and we had a very strong quarter in Europe and Asia in Institutional Securities. But I think there\u2019s clearly more we can do internationally, so sort of watch that space.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate all of that. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up, Sharon, you mentioned alternatives on the Wealth Management platform. I think you are the largest in the world, but yet it\u2019s still, in terms of distributor of alternative product, But there\u2019s -- it\u2019s still at a low level percentage wise of client assets. So I am curious, James mentioned, building technology, building people. How much do you have to prepare the platform or is it there waiting for this deluge of products that\u2019s coming, I am trying to get a window into what\u2019s coming in terms of alternative distribution on your platform?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think it\u2019s a great question and we -- as you said, we continue to invest in it. We have obviously seen the alternative players creating more product and you see that from peers, but you also even see that from our own from MSM as a secular growth trend in a place that we are investing. They have obviously created products now that are more appropriate or more suitable for retail and our platform is there. We are working very closely together. There\u2019s clearly more that we can do. As Jim said, we are continuing to invest. But I agree with you that this is a place where we have seen an uptick. We noted it over the course of this quarter. It was interesting to us, as I know we have discussed it individually as well, Glenn, and I think, it\u2019s a place where you will just continue to see that kind of growth investment from both us and also on the product side.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry, [Indiscernible]paper, I couldn\u2019t even find the handset. So I had a question first on the Wealth Management deposits and thanks, Sharon, for that indication of updating the NII outlook. But when we think about the deposits and the potential beta, what\u2019s your expectation for beta this time around and what percentage of your deposits are actually on the self-directed platform? We get the asset percentages, but it\u2019s my sense that self-directed runs with a higher percentage of cash. So I am guessing the percentage of deposits would be -- would skew higher than the assets do on that platform and could that impact your beta this time around? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think it\u2019s a great question. I think about it as two parts, probably, actually a bit separately. One with beta, beta for us is informed by the last rate hike cycle. So, we have given you historically and we stand by as sort of a 50 beta as an end state. But, obviously, beta also moves through time as you see different rate cycles, and so that\u2019s stage sort of point A, if you think about just where the beta is. Your point on deposits is also interesting. I think that we think about deposits as we look at the composition of the deposits. And obviously, what E*TRADE did and the self-directed channel did is it offered us more deposits from smaller accounts with smaller levels and that might -- to your point that might have a different beta. So there\u2019s a beta, obviously, holistically, but then there\u2019s a beta, as you have mentioned, that might depend on where you are within the size of the accounts and the stickiness that you might see associated with those deposits. So, we are looking at it from two ways. Overall, beta the same, but the deposits themselves and the way that we think about the runoff of the deposits might be different this time around, just given our own composition of the deposits as they have been acquired by E*TRADE.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then for the follow-up, sticking with the rate sensitivity, SBL growth has been quite remarkable this -- for the past many years. When we think about what happen last rate hiking cycle, I went back and I looked through, and the interesting thing is the SBLs weren\u2019t often thought of as rate sensitive, but they continued to grow in the last rate hiking cycle. So, how do you think about this time around if the product is obviously mature, but more mature and so maybe could be more subject to some rate sensitivity, but also like advisors and customers, probably, understand the value of the product better, too. And so there\u2019s a couple of cross currents and I can\u2019t quite get my head around exactly how to think about it, but what are your thoughts on that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Thanks for the question. I think when you -- your points are, I think, appropriate. You are looking at, obviously, yeah, it was nascent. What I\u2019d say about our profile is, we didn\u2019t have the same size of household penetration across lending products. Then and even today, there is still, I\u2019d say, room to run in better understanding educating products and educating our clients about the different products that are available to them. Now, of course, the pace may change and that\u2019s not impossible given what we are seeing or what you might think could happen. That\u2019s not really the prediction. But the idea is there\u2019s still more education that can be done and that\u2019s why I think we feel comfortable that even though we might see rates rise. The actual amount that we gave you as guidance from a lending perspective should continue. Part of that obviously being SBL, part of that being mortgages. But when you look at the household penetration even five years, six years ago, you were in very low-double digits for us and you have only reached that mid-teen numbers. So still a lot more to go, as I said, around the education of that product for clients where that\u2019s suitable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. The $75 billion acquisition of AUM that you got within Wealth Management, this is the second transaction I think over the last 12 months. Can you talk about the capabilities that you are getting with this and how this is being integrated more broadly into the Wealth platform? And also just thinking about the backdrop and strategy, should we see more of these type of transactions going forward?\nSharon Yeshaya: So why don\u2019t I start with just saying, we will see more when it\u2019s appropriate for our -- we are obviously continuing to look at this space. What these are, and as James said, when we are looking at retirement, we are looking at defined benefit. We are looking at understanding how workplace coincides with the FA advisor-led space together and the way that I would think of this is just an extension of our strategy. So the best kind of concept that you can say is, yes, we had a proof point in the third quarter of last year. We are obviously in a situation where we have acquired a similar plan and group of advisors. The group of advisors covered defined benefit contribution plans. Those defined benefit contribution plans have corporations associated with them that may also have participants. Those -- in this case, we have 1 million participants that were added. That -- those participants, if you go back to our strategy of the funnel, they are a top portion of that funnel that we begin to advise or educate or learn or teach people about financial wellness. We give them access to our services particularly that we have already developed in the workplace channel. And so that educational content has a crossover and then they now understand better what financial wellness is. They can say, I am interested in speaking to a financial adviser. So that\u2019s where the channels begin to converge and merge, and where you are beginning to really think about the top of the funnel into potentially providing access and advice to clients over time.\nDan Fannon: Got it. That makes sense. And you did talk about within the workplace, higher retention rates and more companion accounts. I don\u2019t know if you can give some stats around that, but maybe you are also I think highlighted that the integration costs will be done with E*TRADE by the end of the year. So maybe what\u2019s left in terms of milestones with that and then within the kind of workplace, some of the momentum and progress, any numbers would be helpful? Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So the companion accounts, what we have said is that, by the end of this year, approximately 90% of U.S. stock participants will be in a position to access a companion account. Should they want to or should they have the stock to invest into the account. So that\u2019s the point there. The question around the retention of assets, we had given that metric at the beginning of -- in the January deck and we talked about aiming towards 30% and we have made improvements from the 24% that we gave you at the end of the quarter. So, all of those are milestones as you think about integration and integration-related expenses. And also the points that James had made around the investment in our business in technology and in this -- and in the integration more broadly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on M&A outlook. Organic growth has moderated granted versus what admittedly was a neck breaking pace that we had seen last year. And to what extent does the market volatility disrupt adviser movement across the wealth space and have you seen any improvement in breakaway broker trends or just the recruiting backlog more broadly as volatility has started to moderate versus the level seen in Jan and Feb?\nSharon Yeshaya: Thanks for the question, Steve. So as it relates to net recruiting, still seeing inflows on the back of net recruiting, in fact, all three channels, as you think about NNA were contributors to the net -- the NNA number excluding the asset retention, so if you just take that other piece or the asset acquisition. And if you look just at the advisor led channel, a couple of factors; so, one, net recruiting positive; two, on the actual adviser side, evenly split between existing accounts or existing clients and new clients, so continuing to see consolidation of assets held away, as well as new client relationships going forward. And then we had a contribution from workplace, which is obviously impacted by both the companion accounts and also retention of assets and self-directed. So, really broad-based contributions from the different channels and net recruiting, as I said, remains very -- in a good -- in a solid place.\nSteven Chubak: Understood. And just for a follow-up, just trying to clarify some of the NII guidance, I was hoping you could provide, Sharon, an update on the loan growth outlook, whether you are still comfortable with the mid-teens loan growth you had guided to previously and does the more than $1 billion NII benefit that you alluded to in your prepared remarks contemplate some continued loan growth or is that on a static balance sheet?\nSharon Yeshaya: It\u2019s the same loan growth number that I gave you. So the percent that you gave, if you take that and you think it was basically about $5 billion a quarter, so we just gave you in dollars this time around. It\u2019s the same that I gave in January. And then that is what\u2019s -- the point around the -- I don\u2019t know if it was illusion, I actually gave you that it was double. So I said at least double in terms of the NII guidance increase. That really has to do with the realization of the forward curve and the change in the forward curve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey. Good morning. Just a quick couple of follow ups. One, Sharon, if you could remind us in terms of the NII guide, how big is the money market waivers kind of coming back now that we have had the first fed hike and is there any additional improvement that we should expect if the fed hikes by 50 bps in May?\nSharon Yeshaya: So our money market guidance we gave you was about plus $200 million and we stand by plus $200 million, but I\u2019d say, for the full year. It\u2019s really based on two factors that are contributing into that. One is the balances, as well as the industry and the waivers, how quickly those waivers roll off. So we are -- $200 million for the remainder of the year for the increase for Investment Management.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Understood. And just as a follow-up, when you think about, it\u2019s a tougher question around the macro outlook when we think about M&A, IPOs coming back. Any sense in terms of when you look at the world feels like volatility is going to be high, which bodes well for trading. But how do you handicap just talking to sort of your corporate clients around appetite for deal making and given just the current geopolitical backdrop, any color would be helpful?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. So a couple of things, first on the advisory pipeline in particular. Pipeline remains healthy and diversified. So taking a look at the underlying pipeline still diversified across sectors, which I think is another healthy sign in terms of the marketplace. As it relates to the underwriting calendar, that obviously you do have deals that didn\u2019t necessarily come to market in the first quarter. They -- that pipeline to realize, that was associated really with the volatility and the uncertainty in the first quarter, as that recedes, to the extent it does, that would move things from the pipeline state to the realized state.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I have a question and a follow-up. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. Going back to, you said, core net new asset growth for the quarter was 5.4%, if I got that right excluding the deal. And so that is down from where you were before, but it\u2019s certainly up from where you guys have been a few years ago. So where do you expect that to settle out and what\u2019s the relative contribution, say, E*TRADE versus the other legacy businesses?\nSharon Yeshaya: We have given what I think we -- where we started, Mike, is we said and James said it in January. 11%, which we saw last year, was exceptional and we didn\u2019t expect that to be repeated in the near-term or we weren\u2019t sure and we wanted to see how the pipeline moved out and how these different channels work together. But what we did say is 3% to 4% is where we used to be and we weren\u2019t expecting to see that, obviously, we are also at a higher base now and so that\u2019s also something to bear in mind. So I think we feel very good about where we are and this is well within that range that we had basically given you. We said, we would spend time better understanding the channels to provide guidance over time. You asked another. The contribution from each of the channels, as I said, three different channels all contributed very, very nicely. We don\u2019t break it out into different pieces, but I would say that, the integration is going well and the E*TRADE client and client usage is also doing well.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And my follow-up question is on the block trading investigation, which you guys highlighted in your filings. And I know you are limited about what you want to say, I know you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t give any expectations. But there might be some things that you could disclose around this. This might wind up being a non-event. I mean there\u2019s investigations all the time. We get it. But every now and then one of these investigations lead to something. I am not saying that this is the case, but I just want to what investors ask me, what do you think the impact to the block trading investigation of Morgan Stanley could be? It would be nice for me and investors to have that answer, so with that big wind up. How much do you make from block trading per year and were these issues self-disclosed by Morgan Stanley to the regulators or did it come from an outside party? Thank you. \nJames Gorman: Hey, Mike. Certainly prepared your first question about the net new money growth and high class problems of not achieving 11% organic, 5.4% is generating something like $200 million to $250 million net a year. So it\u2019s actually a great problem, and I think, as Sharon said, the various channels there are going to continue to contribute. My telling you all of this is to say, I can\u2019t talk about ongoing investigations on block trades, obviously and we are not going to do that on an earnings call. But you can look at our equities business and how it performs generally and how it\u2019s done over many, many years. And its current performance and draw, whatever conclusions might be appropriate, but right now we can\u2019t talk about ongoing investigations and it doesn\u2019t matter whether this one or any other one from any authority, it\u2019s always the same rule.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Sharon. Sharon, can you share with us when you take a look at the equities business, as well as the FIC [ph] business and all the disruption we saw in the quarter. Has there been any opportunity for you guys to grab market share from maybe some other competitors that are weaker and are unable to handle the volatility the way you guys did?\nSharon Yeshaya: Thanks, Gerard for the question. I -- actually I know a lot of the peers have released this morning. So I haven\u2019t looked specifically at this quarter\u2019s number in terms of this -- the public market share. But what I can tell you is that we have seen increased share over time. I think we are really proud of the position that we have made in both of the sales and trading franchises. A lot of that has to do with what James discussed more directly in his script, which is building these -- investing our people and talent both geographically and also making sure that we have it across different functions. So all of these things are important, I think it\u2019s decades in the making rather than just one quarter, and we are really proud of the way that we thought about the continue -- the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows.\nGerard Cassidy: And then a second, following-up on your commentary about your pipeline and we all understand the volatility of what\u2019s going on out there, if the markets settle down but they settled down at lower valuations in the underwriting area. Do you still think that could come back or do we need higher valuations, so that there\u2019s not basically down, almost like a down round where private has to go public, if that\u2019s their intention at a lower price than what they have raised money on the private side?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that will be very -- I think individual companies will make their own decisions in terms of where they have that from an advice driven perspective.\nJames Gorman: I just -- if you look at pipeline and you look at investment banking revenue through cycles. It\u2019s actually remarkably stable on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, it\u2019s extremely volatile. I mean, look at the change between fourth quarter ECM and first quarter ECM. But then look at what M&A did the advisory business, I think, over $800 million. But if you go through the end of the year, I am sure you will find it\u2019s much more stable and reflective of what we have done in 2020, 2021 period. So I don\u2019t think that -- it\u2019s a very interesting question you raised, but I don\u2019t think that individual companies, they don\u2019t make their decisions obviously based on averages of what the market theme is based on what their own equity capital needs are or debt capital needs or M&A needs. And listen, we have got -- we have one of the best franchises in the world. It is global. So any cross border deals, any global companies, we are in it. That won\u2019t change. It\u2019s just a question as a Q1 or Q3. So I am really unphased by the volatility and banking on a quarterly basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNB Paribas.\nJeremy Sigee: Hi, there. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the lower transaction revenues in Wealth Management and not so much about what happened in the quarter, but just looking at March and April, what\u2019s the state of mind in your Wealth Management clients? Is this an environment where they are going to stay active or become more active again or is this a sort of wait and see kind of mood among your clients?\nSharon Yeshaya: So actually it\u2019s an interesting question. Two things that struck me as we sort of went through and thought about the quarter. One is the fact that when you look at allocations of investors in the retail space in terms of where their positions were in equities, fixed income, cash, cash equivalents, et cetera, on a proportional basis. Over the last year or two actually, those percentages have actually also remained relatively stable. So the retail investors\u2019 investment is something that hasn\u2019t necessarily fluctuated based on the data that we have, that we have seen. Those positions have remained there despite the fact that there\u2019s been volatility. The second point is, specifically on self-directed is, the E*TRADE, the fact that, this is what I tried to mention in the script was, where we are from the daily average trade levels, still very, very high, 3 times the high from when E*TRADE was a standalone company. And so I think it highlights the change that we have seen in the retail sentiment over the course of the last two years or three years.\nJames Gorman: I\u2019d just add two points to that. Number one, the transaction revenue line in Wealth Management has the DCP impact in it, which was actually very big this quarter. That bounces around. And secondly, if you look at the P&L of Wealth Management, actually the transaction revenues as a driver of the overall health of the business is relatively small. I mean, the much more important are the fee-based revenues, the net interest income, what we are doing in the banking side. So, and then some of the new issue stuff. So I just put that out there. It\u2019s -- again, it\u2019s one of these things that, honestly, I am not very pleased, I am much more interested in asset growth, net new asset growth and what we are doing in the bank than deposits, transactions will bounce around given market volatility.\nJeremy Sigee: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And could I just ask a follow-up, I am sitting in Europe, you mentioned Europe was strong. Could you talk about which bits were driving that? What was so great in Europe this quarter?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that this is really based on the advice driven model, right? You have uncertainty in Europe. There\u2019s a lot going on. Obviously, there are pieces of commodities, for example, it\u2019s very specific. But then you also just see client engagement as it relates to various parts of Europe and being able to service that advice is all part of this diversified model.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning, everyone. Question on the family office strategy, there was an interesting article recently and I figured to dig in here a little bit more. I know it\u2019s always been a focus for Morgan Stanley and really the firm is uniquely positioned in my opinion to really take advantage of that. But I am curious kind of what is new in the strategy and how you guys would maybe frame the evolution and kind of where the opportunity is accelerating?\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely. I am actually glad you asked the question. I think it\u2019s a really interesting space and I think it\u2019s an example of connecting the dots. So over the course of the last couple of years, what we have realized is there\u2019s a need for family offices to have access to services that we already offer Institutional Securities clients through our Fund Services platform. And so bringing together those conversations between what\u2019s happening in the Institutional Securities Group and what strategy we are driving in Wealth Management is just an example of how the business is working more closely together to find those opportunities to service clients as family offices begin to feel more like Institutional accounts, and that back and forth in dialogue is really amongst the team, the leadership and then throughout the organization.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Sharon. Quick follow-up, just on the digital asset strategy and maybe how you would frame where you are today both in GWM and Institutional, and what we could expect over the next year?\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely. As you know, we are obviously offering some -- we have some offerings for different qualified investors that we have.

            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know you have a very, very busy morning, so we did our best to keep these earnings uncomplicated for you. Heading into 2022, we anticipate, as everybody did, a more volatile market, and obviously, we saw that in the first quarter. The year started with rising inflationary pressures, accelerated expectations for tightening of monetary policy, and most notably, and sadly, the invasion of Ukraine. This backdrop injected significant uncertainty into the markets and further tested resiliency of our franchise. Against this quickly evolving market environment, our diversified business model again generated high returns. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion and a ROTCE of 20%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter results continued to exemplify Morgan Stanley's strength and affirm our long-term strategy. First, Institutional Securities delivered another very strong quarter, with revenues of $7.7 billion, making it one of its highest performances ever. Compared to last year's record first quarter, we saw a different mix of businesses driving the strength of this segment. While underwriting was muted, Advisory was a highlight. Equity and fixed income again delivered exceptional results, particularly in Asia and Europe, as we supported our global clients amid a turbulent backdrop. Global balanced Institutional businesses are complex. They require many years to build and an enormous amount invested in human capital. The breadth and depth of our franchise today is a competitive differentiator. Wealth Management showcased its resiliency in the quarter. Notwithstanding, fluctuating market levels, the business generated a margin of approximately 28% excluding integration-related expenses. The E*TRADE integration continues to go very well, and given the current path we are on, a significant portion of the integration will be done by the end of this year. By the end of 2022, we expect to no longer separate our integration expenses. Net new assets for the quarter were $142 billion. That included an asset acquisition. Nonetheless, organic growth in our existing business remained very strong. In a volatile market, this is very affirming of the model. Further, we saw our first rate hike in the year in the first quarter, and with our strong and growing deposit base, this will have a near immediate economic impact to our business and it supports our path to delivering the margins that we projected in excess of 30%. In Investment Management, the increased diversification of the business supported results in a very choppy market. Fee based asset management revenues, which were $1.4 billion in the quarter, have grown with the addition of Parametric, Calvert and the broadening of our alts and fixed income platforms. We have performed better with these franchises than we would have without it and it has brought much more balance to our asset management business. And with respect to the Eaton Vance integration, it progresses very smoothly as well. The teams remain stable, and culturally, it's a terrific fit. Our markets continue to evolve, we remain confident about our position and the many opportunities ahead. Finally, a brief word on the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. In managing a global business, particularly a market-based global business, we must always remain vigilant about the potential for shocks or unexpected events. Obviously, the invasion of the Ukraine is one such event. First of all, and most importantly, our hearts go out to the Ukrainians and all those have been impacted. As it relates to the business, apart from the volatility it's created, there's been very limited financial impact to Morgan Stanley. A few years ago, we decided to give up our banking license and we significantly scaled back operations in Russia. Further, as a result of these actions and the current war, we are not entering into any new business in the country and our activities are limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations. I am very proud of how our team has managed through a difficult market backdrop, and going forward, we continue to navigate the turbulent markets and broader geopolitical environment with confidence. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and together we will take your questions. Glenn, it's a high class problem and its great position to be in. We have been very protective of keeping a sort of buffer on a buffer, because you never know in this world and I think what we have experienced with the markets in the last quarter were extremely volatile and you just have to -- you have to anticipate the worst and make sure you are prepared for that. We clearly have done that. We have been chipping away at the excess capital. If you add back the OCI, we are running about 15% CET1. We were well above 16%. So, clearly, we will see where our CCAR results are. I think last year, they are around 13.2% or 13.3%. I'd be surprised if there's material changes. But let's see. So we are still sitting on a significant buffer. Listen, we are clearly going to keep pushing capital distribution through buyback and dividend to shareholders. That's clearly the case. We have just done two major acquisitions with about $21 billion. We would do more deals if as they -- if they fit with our strategy, we won't do things that take us offline, off piece. We want to stay true to our strategy and our strengths in our three core businesses. So, yeah, continued buyback, but also a lot of investment in the business. I mean, we are doing a lot on the tech side. Obviously, we want to stay completely compliant with our regulatory responsibilities and we will continue to invest to make sure we are best-in-class there. But a lot of investment technology and a lot of investment around the retirement workplace platform, which I think is sort of the next frontier. And we are just in baby steps, we are very early days of that, but I think that's a huge opportunity. And finally, I do think that there are opportunities outside of the U.S., even though we are along the US and that served us incredibly well, and I think, will serve us very well for the next decade. But I think in the Wealth and Asset Management spaces internationally, we punch below our weight. On Institutional Securities we don't and we had a very strong quarter in Europe and Asia in Institutional Securities. But I think there's clearly more we can do internationally, so sort of watch that space. Hey, Mike. Certainly prepared your first question about the net new money growth and high class problems of not achieving 11% organic, 5.4% is generating something like $200 million to $250 million net a year. So it's actually a great problem, and I think, as Sharon said, the various channels there are going to continue to contribute. My telling you all of this is to say, I can't talk about ongoing investigations on block trades, obviously and we are not going to do that on an earnings call. But you can look at our equities business and how it performs generally and how it's done over many, many years. And its current performance and draw, whatever conclusions might be appropriate, but right now we can't talk about ongoing investigations and it doesn't matter whether this one or any other one from any authority, it's always the same rule. I just -- if you look at pipeline and you look at investment banking revenue through cycles. It's actually remarkably stable on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, it's extremely volatile. I mean, look at the change between fourth quarter ECM and first quarter ECM. But then look at what M&A did the advisory business, I think, over $800 million. But if you go through the end of the year, I am sure you will find it's much more stable and reflective of what we have done in 2020, 2021 period. So I don't think that -- it's a very interesting question you raised, but I don't think that individual companies, they don't make their decisions obviously based on averages of what the market theme is based on what their own equity capital needs are or debt capital needs or M&A needs. And listen, we have got -- we have one of the best franchises in the world. It is global. So any cross border deals, any global companies, we are in it. That won't change. It's just a question as a Q1 or Q3. So I am really unphased by the volatility and banking on a quarterly basis. I'd just add two points to that. Number one, the transaction revenue line in Wealth Management has the DCP impact in it, which was actually very big this quarter. That bounces around. And secondly, if you look at the P&L of Wealth Management, actually the transaction revenues as a driver of the overall health of the business is relatively small. I mean, the much more important are the fee-based revenues, the net interest income, what we are doing in the banking side. So, and then some of the new issue stuff. So I just put that out there. It's -- again, it's one of these things that, honestly, I am not very pleased, I am much more interested in asset growth, net new asset growth and what we are doing in the bank than deposits, transactions will bounce around given market volatility."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the first quarter, representing the second highest quarter in our firm's history. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $2.06 and our ROTCE was 20.3%. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio, excluding integration-related expenses was 67.9% and reflects our expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the businesses. Results of the first quarter illustrate resiliency and durability. Equity and fixed income supported our clients, while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management proved resilient and Investment Management benefited from diversification. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $7.7 billion represented the third highest quarter on record. Results declined 11% from the record set in the prior year. This quarter's performance again demonstrated the power of our global integrated investment bank, with balance across businesses and a strong presence across geographies. We remain a global diversified leader. Europe delivered its best quarter in over a decade, while Asia saw its second highest result, with strength in both equities and fixed income. Investment Banking revenues grew $1.6 Billion, led by strength in Advisory. Compared to the prior year, revenues declined by 37%. Advisory revenues were $944 million, almost double the prior year's first quarter, reflecting higher completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $258 million, a meaningful decline from last year's elevated results, in line with market volumes. Heightened volatility led clients to delay issuance activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $432 million, down compared to the prior year as macroeconomic conditions contributed to lower bond issuances. Investment banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions. However, the conversion from pipeline to realize will be largely dependent on market conditions going forward. Equity revenues were $3.2 billion, reflecting broad-based strength in performance against the backdrop of volatile markets. We continue to be a global leader in this business. Cash revenues were solid, with particular strength in Europe, consistent with market volumes by geography. Derivative revenues were robust and the business navigated the volatility well. Prime brokerage revenues were strong, while intra-quarter balances were impacted by uncertainty, we saw balances rebound alongside markets. Fixed income revenues of $2.9 billion were in line with the very strong prior year. In the quarter, commodities and macro, particularly foreign exchange led the strength. Macro revenues increased meaningfully from the prior quarter. Clients remained engaged and the trading environment proved constructive. Micro results were strong, but reflected lower revenues compared to the prior year. Commodities delivered a more diversified results, with revenues notably higher than the previous first quarter, benefiting from the heightened levels of activity. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $5.9 billion. Declines in DCP negatively impacted the revenues by approximately $300 million. Excluding the impact related to DCP, revenues increased 6% versus the prior year's first quarter results. Results underscore the resilience of the franchise, the value offered to clients during uncertain times and the benefits of our scaled multi-channel model. Retail clients remained invested, with allocations across asset classes consistent with last year. PBT was $1.6 billion and the margin was 26.5% or 27.8%, excluding integration-related expenses. These strong results should continue to be supported, as we realize the benefits of rising rates. Asset management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 14% versus last year, benefiting from the growth in fee-based assets. This growth continues to reflect the investments we have made into the business over time and affirms our strategy is working. Net new assets were $142 billion for the quarter. NNA was inclusive of an asset acquisition, which I will touch on shortly. Absent this asset acquisition, annualized growth was 5.4%, and despite the volatility, net new assets were generated from all channels. The advisor-led channel benefited from an even split of existing and new clients, as well as positive net recruiting. Fee-based flows were also strong and inclusive of the asset acquisition were $97 billion. Workplace continues to benefit from the establishment of companion accounts. Retention of assets also continued to rise as a result of incremental companion account adoption and the value of the platform. In the quarter, we added $75 billion of retirement assets through an asset acquisition of our institutional retirement -- of an institutional retirement consultant. We remain a platform of choice and this is the second institutional retirement plan to join us in the last nine months. We continue to view these asset acquisitions as incremental opportunities to reach the expanded audience through education and financial wellness. The acquired team's client base includes nearly one million of plan participants. Transactional revenues were $635 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, which is reflected in this line revenues were strong. Although activity moderated from the prior year, self-directed daily average trades remained above $1 million in the quarter, over 3 times E*TRADE pre-asset acquisition record. We have also seen meaningful interest in our alternatives offering, given our broad-based access to managers and their retail-oriented products. Loan growth remained strong in the quarter, with bank lending balances growing $7 billion, driven by securities-based lending and mortgages. We expect loan growth over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $5 billion per quarter. Deposits increased $6 billion in the quarter to $352 billion. The average rate on deposits declined to 9 basis points. We have completed the net runoff in wholesale deposits and do not anticipate further declines in deposit costs. Net interest income was $1.5 billion. Excluding prepayment amortization, NII increased 15% from the prior year driven by loan growth. Back in January, we indicated that the fourth quarter NII was a reasonable base to inform 2022 and that we would expect $500 million of incremental NII on the back of rising rates. Due to the further moves in rate expectations since January, we should see this benefit at least double if the forward curve and our modeled assumptions are realized over the remaining nine months of the year. Moving to Investment Management. My remarks will refer to quarter-over-quarter changes as the timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.3 billion. The sequential decline reflects the seasonally lower performance fees, which are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter and a more challenging market environment. Despite headwinds, this business is benefiting from increased scale and a more diversified product offering. Total AUM of $1.4 trillion declined 8% quarter-over-quarter as a result of market declines and outflows. Long-term net outflows reflected approximately $9 billion of institutional outflows in our Solutions business, including the expected redemption of a large asset manager who brought their equity trading implementation in-house. Equity strategies saw a giveback of some of the prior year's asset appreciation, as the broader market experienced a rotation out of growth. This was partially offset by the continued strong flows into Parametric customized portfolios, as well as our inflation-related and interest rate-sensitive products. Asset management and related fees decreased sequentially to $1.4 billion on the back of the aforementioned seasonality and market volatility. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $53 million in the quarter, driven by markdowns in one of the Asia private equity funds. Declines in deferred compensation plan investments and negative marks associated with legacy international real estate investments. Away from these specific markdowns, we saw broad-based gains across our alternatives platform, reflecting the strength and diversity of the platform. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio sequentially declined and now stands at 14.5%. Multiple factors contributed to this change. Standardized RWAs increased as client activity returned after the more moderated levels at the end of 2021 and volatility increased. OCI related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio reflected an increase of an unrealized loss of $2.4 billion as a result of higher interest rates. While this should earn back over time, it impacted our CET1 ratio by 50 basis points in the quarter. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, as we repurchased $2.9 billion of stock in the quarter. We remain in a strong capital position. Our tax rate was 19% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based compensation and the share-based award conversions takes place in the first quarter creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in line with full year 2021. The first quarter again tested the resiliency of our franchise. We are pleased with how our team navigated the volatile environment and stayed close to clients during times of uncertainty. While the outlook for the remainder of the year is difficult to predict, the second quarter has started constructively and clients remain engaged. With that, we will now open up the line to questions. I think it's a great question and we -- as you said, we continue to invest in it. We have obviously seen the alternative players creating more product and you see that from peers, but you also even see that from our own from MSM as a secular growth trend in a place that we are investing. They have obviously created products now that are more appropriate or more suitable for retail and our platform is there. We are working very closely together. There's clearly more that we can do. As Jim said, we are continuing to invest. But I agree with you that this is a place where we have seen an uptick. We noted it over the course of this quarter. It was interesting to us, as I know we have discussed it individually as well, Glenn, and I think, it's a place where you will just continue to see that kind of growth investment from both us and also on the product side. Sure. I think it's a great question. I think about it as two parts, probably, actually a bit separately. One with beta, beta for us is informed by the last rate hike cycle. So, we have given you historically and we stand by as sort of a 50 beta as an end state. But, obviously, beta also moves through time as you see different rate cycles, and so that's stage sort of point A, if you think about just where the beta is. Your point on deposits is also interesting. I think that we think about deposits as we look at the composition of the deposits. And obviously, what E*TRADE did and the self-directed channel did is it offered us more deposits from smaller accounts with smaller levels and that might -- to your point that might have a different beta. So there's a beta, obviously, holistically, but then there's a beta, as you have mentioned, that might depend on where you are within the size of the accounts and the stickiness that you might see associated with those deposits. So, we are looking at it from two ways. Overall, beta the same, but the deposits themselves and the way that we think about the runoff of the deposits might be different this time around, just given our own composition of the deposits as they have been acquired by E*TRADE. Thanks for the question. I think when you -- your points are, I think, appropriate. You are looking at, obviously, yeah, it was nascent. What I'd say about our profile is, we didn't have the same size of household penetration across lending products. Then and even today, there is still, I'd say, room to run in better understanding educating products and educating our clients about the different products that are available to them. Now, of course, the pace may change and that's not impossible given what we are seeing or what you might think could happen. That's not really the prediction. But the idea is there's still more education that can be done and that's why I think we feel comfortable that even though we might see rates rise. The actual amount that we gave you as guidance from a lending perspective should continue. Part of that obviously being SBL, part of that being mortgages. But when you look at the household penetration even five years, six years ago, you were in very low-double digits for us and you have only reached that mid-teen numbers. So still a lot more to go, as I said, around the education of that product for clients where that's suitable. So why don't I start with just saying, we will see more when it's appropriate for our -- we are obviously continuing to look at this space. What these are, and as James said, when we are looking at retirement, we are looking at defined benefit. We are looking at understanding how workplace coincides with the FA advisor-led space together and the way that I would think of this is just an extension of our strategy. So the best kind of concept that you can say is, yes, we had a proof point in the third quarter of last year. We are obviously in a situation where we have acquired a similar plan and group of advisors. The group of advisors covered defined benefit contribution plans. Those defined benefit contribution plans have corporations associated with them that may also have participants. Those -- in this case, we have 1 million participants that were added. That -- those participants, if you go back to our strategy of the funnel, they are a top portion of that funnel that we begin to advise or educate or learn or teach people about financial wellness. We give them access to our services particularly that we have already developed in the workplace channel. And so that educational content has a crossover and then they now understand better what financial wellness is. They can say, I am interested in speaking to a financial adviser. So that's where the channels begin to converge and merge, and where you are beginning to really think about the top of the funnel into potentially providing access and advice to clients over time. Sure. So the companion accounts, what we have said is that, by the end of this year, approximately 90% of U.S. stock participants will be in a position to access a companion account. Should they want to or should they have the stock to invest into the account. So that's the point there. The question around the retention of assets, we had given that metric at the beginning of -- in the January deck and we talked about aiming towards 30% and we have made improvements from the 24% that we gave you at the end of the quarter. So, all of those are milestones as you think about integration and integration-related expenses. And also the points that James had made around the investment in our business in technology and in this -- and in the integration more broadly. Thanks for the question, Steve. So as it relates to net recruiting, still seeing inflows on the back of net recruiting, in fact, all three channels, as you think about NNA were contributors to the net -- the NNA number excluding the asset retention, so if you just take that other piece or the asset acquisition. And if you look just at the advisor led channel, a couple of factors; so, one, net recruiting positive; two, on the actual adviser side, evenly split between existing accounts or existing clients and new clients, so continuing to see consolidation of assets held away, as well as new client relationships going forward. And then we had a contribution from workplace, which is obviously impacted by both the companion accounts and also retention of assets and self-directed. So, really broad-based contributions from the different channels and net recruiting, as I said, remains very -- in a good -- in a solid place. It's the same loan growth number that I gave you. So the percent that you gave, if you take that and you think it was basically about $5 billion a quarter, so we just gave you in dollars this time around. It's the same that I gave in January. And then that is what's -- the point around the -- I don't know if it was illusion, I actually gave you that it was double. So I said at least double in terms of the NII guidance increase. That really has to do with the realization of the forward curve and the change in the forward curve. So our money market guidance we gave you was about plus $200 million and we stand by plus $200 million, but I'd say, for the full year. It's really based on two factors that are contributing into that. One is the balances, as well as the industry and the waivers, how quickly those waivers roll off. So we are -- $200 million for the remainder of the year for the increase for Investment Management. Yeah. So a couple of things, first on the advisory pipeline in particular. Pipeline remains healthy and diversified. So taking a look at the underlying pipeline still diversified across sectors, which I think is another healthy sign in terms of the marketplace. As it relates to the underwriting calendar, that obviously you do have deals that didn't necessarily come to market in the first quarter. They -- that pipeline to realize, that was associated really with the volatility and the uncertainty in the first quarter, as that recedes, to the extent it does, that would move things from the pipeline state to the realized state. We have given what I think we -- where we started, Mike, is we said and James said it in January. 11%, which we saw last year, was exceptional and we didn't expect that to be repeated in the near-term or we weren't sure and we wanted to see how the pipeline moved out and how these different channels work together. But what we did say is 3% to 4% is where we used to be and we weren't expecting to see that, obviously, we are also at a higher base now and so that's also something to bear in mind. So I think we feel very good about where we are and this is well within that range that we had basically given you. We said, we would spend time better understanding the channels to provide guidance over time. You asked another. The contribution from each of the channels, as I said, three different channels all contributed very, very nicely. We don't break it out into different pieces, but I would say that, the integration is going well and the E*TRADE client and client usage is also doing well. Thanks, Gerard for the question. I -- actually I know a lot of the peers have released this morning. So I haven't looked specifically at this quarter's number in terms of this -- the public market share. But what I can tell you is that we have seen increased share over time. I think we are really proud of the position that we have made in both of the sales and trading franchises. A lot of that has to do with what James discussed more directly in his script, which is building these -- investing our people and talent both geographically and also making sure that we have it across different functions. So all of these things are important, I think it's decades in the making rather than just one quarter, and we are really proud of the way that we thought about the continue -- the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows. I think that will be very -- I think individual companies will make their own decisions in terms of where they have that from an advice driven perspective. So actually it's an interesting question. Two things that struck me as we sort of went through and thought about the quarter. One is the fact that when you look at allocations of investors in the retail space in terms of where their positions were in equities, fixed income, cash, cash equivalents, et cetera, on a proportional basis. Over the last year or two actually, those percentages have actually also remained relatively stable. So the retail investors' investment is something that hasn't necessarily fluctuated based on the data that we have, that we have seen. Those positions have remained there despite the fact that there's been volatility. The second point is, specifically on self-directed is, the E*TRADE, the fact that, this is what I tried to mention in the script was, where we are from the daily average trade levels, still very, very high, 3 times the high from when E*TRADE was a standalone company. And so I think it highlights the change that we have seen in the retail sentiment over the course of the last two years or three years. I think that this is really based on the advice driven model, right? You have uncertainty in Europe. There's a lot going on. Obviously, there are pieces of commodities, for example, it's very specific. But then you also just see client engagement as it relates to various parts of Europe and being able to service that advice is all part of this diversified model. Absolutely. I am actually glad you asked the question. I think it's a really interesting space and I think it's an example of connecting the dots. So over the course of the last couple of years, what we have realized is there's a need for family offices to have access to services that we already offer Institutional Securities clients through our Fund Services platform. And so bringing together those conversations between what's happening in the Institutional Securities Group and what strategy we are driving in Wealth Management is just an example of how the business is working more closely together to find those opportunities to service clients as family offices begin to feel more like Institutional accounts, and that back and forth in dialogue is really amongst the team, the leadership and then throughout the organization. Absolutely. As you know, we are obviously offering some -- we have some offerings for different qualified investors that we have. But in this space, we are obviously taking the lead from regulators as it relates to what we can and can't offer various clients."

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to chief executive officer Ted Pick.\nTed Pick: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to affirm Morgan Stanley's strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides. Turning first to Slide 3, over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to '14, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. Transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset, and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis. In 2015 to '19, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then in 2020 to '22, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two major business lines -- wealth and investment management and institutional securities generated operating leverage and high returns. Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results. In 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to '14. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was tripled the post crisis years. Combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT, and our category of one asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability. The actions we have taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to Slide 4, since 2010, revenues and wealth and investment management have more than doubled, and today we are number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets. In wealth management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels -- advisor led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA growth to continue to vary quarter by quarter, given seasonality and even year to year given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering. Over time, our ability to track, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds in our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before, and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as parametric, private markets and value add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles. Turning to Slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our Integrated Investment bank is a preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation. Over the last decade, we have advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our market's presence. In a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the U.S., acting as a true global investment bank, is critical for the Morgan Stanley franchise. After more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors, and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity which will drive investment banking growth, and as such are particularly focused on expanding our 15% world share in that advice driven business. Turning to Slide 6. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities efficiently facilitates the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley's firmwide Solutions has never been stronger. Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C suite on strategy, to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed, up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth. Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to Slide 7. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going. The intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is particularly important. Andy, in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management, is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead institutional securities, where he spent 25 years, will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan, Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the enduring strength of our culture. Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders, we're enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by a world class technology and infrastructure organization, and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital, and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today. Turning to Slide 8, in addition to one -- the performance of the business, two -- driving an integrated firm and three -- maintaining our culture, we are four highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong, going to the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as ventured within our stress capital buffer, have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts, that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend as it is at the core of our business model's durability. While we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses, and repurchase our stock, the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four firmwide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pretax margin, a 70% firmwide efficiency ratio, and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We enter 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation in fact has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and supply chain, that could result in a stickier fed and the resulting higher for longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These risks, the geopolitical and that of the U.S. economy, present some uncertainties as we start 2024. Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle, and based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence, and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investor management, and remain committed to growing high quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world. In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you.\nA - Sharon Yeshaya: Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8% and EPS was $5.18, and for the fourth quarter ROTCE was 8.4% and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results. The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter. A $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million were both realized in the fourth quarter. In addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses, primarily related to a May employee action. The combination of these three items negatively impacted full year EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points. Total integration related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E*TRADE. With the E*TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base, supporting our long-term efficiency goals while still investing in growth. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities' full year revenues were $23.1 billion and quarterly revenues were $4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early 2022, and persisted through most of the past year. Fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities. Investment banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023, which weighed on results. However, optimism began to rise midyear followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting as the investment grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by event driven activity. Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters, and were roughly flat year over year. Equity underwriting revenues were also flat as activity remained muted. As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set, while downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants, we expect the US will lead the recovery globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs the CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipeline. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the institution works across the businesses with CEOs, CFOs and Treasurers on corporate solutions. Strength and sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance, and eventually feed through to the broader market activity. Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid. Results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances. Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes, particularly in Asia, ex-Japan. Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter as the business continued to grow the client base. Fixed income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022 strong results. The full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities, which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia compared to heightened engagement in the region last year. Micro was down year over year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events. Results in commodities were up versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business. Turning to wealth management. For the full year, wealth management's revenues were $26.3 billion and the pretax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events. The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates were particularly consequential as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin. In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin including integration related expenses, the FDIC special assessment, severance charges and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings compared to last year. Taken together, these four items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points. Total client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-base flows were $109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in asset management revenues. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated, and clients continue to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances. The eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset crosses. Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year, net new asset growth was driven by the advisor led channel across existing clients, new clients and net recruiting. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues increased slightly year-over-year as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products. Bank lending balances of $147 billion remain roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposits increased 2% quarter over quarter to $346 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in sweep balances. Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build and sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps and client accounts. Assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter. Our asset led gathering strategy remains unchanged, and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The path is clear and includes the following objectives -- First, increase relationships through our channels. Second -- migrate assets to advice. Third -- deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities including new products and solutions, and finally, realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well underway. In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the workplace channel, as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plan. In the prior three years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the investor led -- the advisor led channel on an annual basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds, and on the product side, our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit, private equity, and all their other alternatives. Bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation. As we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time. Investment management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion, supported by higher asset values. Long-term net inflows of approximately $7 billion -- excuse me, long term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven by headwinds in our [MSIM] active equity growth strategies. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies as more retail clients seek customized solutions. Liquidity overlay services had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for parametric's overlay product and the combined parametric brand, inclusive of overlay and its retail offering had net inflows of over $5 billion again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offering. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly performance based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and infrastructure offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased by $13 billion sequentially to $457 billion, as we actively supported clients. We prudently managed our capital profile and ended the year with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.2%, while focusing on our strategic priorities, including our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic at the start of the 4th-quarter, and we bought back $1.3 billion of common stock. The full year tax rate was 21.9%, reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year. The fourth quarter's tax rate was 26.5%, primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter. We expect the 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, consistent with prior years, we continue to expect some quarterly volatility. A number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we ended the year better than where we started. We now have $6.6 trillion of client assets, and we successfully completed our E*TRADE integration. As it relates to capital markets, boardroom confidence is rising and our calendar is building. We approach 2024 with optimism, keenly aware of the dynamic environment we operate in, as we continue to drive towards our performance goals. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. It looks like we lost Dan, we'll move to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I love how you laid out the picture on the wealth management margin potential. And I do like that sweeps have settled in. So I'm curious, in the big picture, has FA and client behavior changed a bunch on the cash management front such that, that's a potential driver of margin potential and why you're leaning towards that mid-20s near term versus the 30% where we were kind of hanging out when rates were lower end deposits were higher. Is that the primary driver of the margin thought? And do you think behaviors changed like permanently?\nSharon Yeshaya: I can't speak about behavior permanently. But I appreciate the question, Glenn. If we take a step back, it was always an idea, the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see growth in fee-based assets, and we see growth in that migration towards the advice-based channel. And in fact, that is what you've begun to see -- look at our fee-based flows this quarter alone and think about the fee-based flows that we've had over the course of the year. We continue to educate our clients. So when we think through the funnel, we have more participants, we begin to see more assets and then those assets will, over time, migrate to advice. What you point out as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting, et cetera, is that we still have that 22%, 23% sitting in cash equivalents, so not necessarily BDP, but rather cash equivalents, that don't necessarily earn a fee, right? Money markets think of a savings product over time, et cetera, that you might see as individuals begin to take that money and deploy it in the markets or deployed into fee-based that will be accretive to the margin over time. And that, to your point, is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client migration towards advice in those fee-based assets.\nGlenn Schorr: Makes sense. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up in wealth, if I could. It certainly doesn't show in your flows this quarter. So I guess I know where you're going to go with this, but you're definitely hearing a lot more from the bank-owned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot more on their intent to better penetrate their banking while clients wallet. So I'm curious if you feel any of that in your franchise, any of that where you compete and whether or not that impacts your thought process on your ability to attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the growth story.\nSharon Yeshaya: So the first point I would say is it's obviously always a competitive market, but we're very well positioned given the tools that we've given to our advisers. A couple of points that I would make to you. The first is when we look forward into the first quarter, that recruiting pipeline is healthy. So when we think about January and what we're seeing, we see the recruiting being healthy. The second point that I'd mention is what I find to be most encouraging when you look under the M&A data, is that we're seeing new clients from the Morgan Stanley. So it's not just attracting assets all the way but rather you're actually getting new clients from those participants. And then you're seeing conversion. So when you think about some of the statistics that I gave you around workplace and we've talked about these statistics, the workplace assets that move over you have 80% of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the institution. So you're bringing new clients in, and then they're bringing their assets that are sitting away into the institution. So I think we're well positioned to capture those opportunities. Final point that I'd make is on your banking products, actually, this idea of the E*TRADE integration, right? And we talked about, we've completed the integration, and I said we're looking towards the forward of the front office integration, some of that will be around banking products, et cetera, as we think and we look ahead over a multiyear journey.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the new role, Ted. I was hoping you could elaborate on the current environment and a little bit more and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make progress against the longer-term targets that you've outlined?\nTed Pick: Thanks for your question. I think we -- as you heard from my comments, we're generally constructive about what 2024 brings and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents, whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that Sharon referred to and redeploy by our wealth clients into the markets, given increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for the wealth channel. In the investment bank, we've had a decade's long route in IPOs slowest volume we've seen in decades. As you know, we've had very light M&A calendar. So that also has been at a trough sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank, specifically inside of investment banking, we think, in order to our benefit to. So we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. Ultimately, we are in the tickets business activity based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment but also for the investment bank. And part of the reason I wanted to talk about the integrated firm today was because the two segments are working together will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities in the firm. We have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business. We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia. So if economic conditions are better than the expected, which is that Europe will struggle in China might as well. If we do any better than that, we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions, too. So it's not just a U.S. proposition but a global one as well.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you. And you mentioned margin within the wealth chain or wealth segment will consolidate around the mid-20s here in the near term. Can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. I worked through that, I think, Dan, when I actually tried to explain it in the script. So the premise in terms of the growing wealth management margin, again, is about the conversion to the advice-based model over time. Of course, individuals will have different pieces, right? But we have three different channels that we've talked about. We've talked about self-directed. We talked about workplace. We've talked about advice. From the self-directive side, we will continue to attract those clients and those that might be interested in advice, we'll see it as we have different ways to give people a sense and a connection to FA. So we've talked about that. On the workplace side, we continue to get new participants, new corporate relationships and that as we educate people with the wellness offering, et cetera. And we've seen evidence of this to bring people yet again to that advice-driven model. And the fee-based flows, as you see those, those will help us grow the asset management line. Then you can break it down again, the transactional line we've talked about, you're going to have new products and you're going to have a deployment of this cash that's been sitting on the sidelines that we've talked a lot about, the dry powder that could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line. And again, we're encouraged by the signs that we're seeing in NII. That too suggests that we are seeing as of right now, it looks like that cash, that frictional level of cash is stabilizing. So I think you have the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side. And then as you think about the expense side, those we are looking for place to invest and gain from the scale of those investments and that will be a part of the objectives that Ted laid out when you see $10 trillion of assets.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thanks. Good morning. Welcome, Ted. Maybe just going back to the strategic update, going to Slide 13, where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last 15 years. As we look forward over the next three to five years. I was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around strategically, I mean M&A has been a key pillar of this transformation as we think about both organic and inorganic one on the M&A side, give us a sense of just where you see deal making happening over the next few years. We saw a big private asset deal being announced on Friday. And so would love some perspective there. And then I think the second thing you mentioned in terms of wallet share on the investment banking side, if we can unpack that a little bit in terms of how you expect to achieve a greater wallet share. Thank you.\nTed Pick: Thanks. Good to talk to you -- with you. It's an interesting question. You're effectively asking what will over the slide look like three, four years from now. We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or '21, where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders. Again, early economy type of activity, and that could grow again towards 50%. And we could have other periods where as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm, that could expand further. I think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the firm is in wealth and investment management is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I want to convey today is that while there is a change in leadership after 14 years of James stewardship, there's not a change in strategy. We have undertaken and integrated, if you really go back into time and then include Mesa West five different acquisitions. And I think the view inside the house is that's good for now. We can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us and it feels organic. Now that having been said, there are ideas that come across the transom and we naturally would take a look. But I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently. I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more. There's a little more work to be done post integration where there could be inefficiencies along the income statement. And I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in wealth and 70% efficiency of the firm. The way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate -- we will achieve those goals. But along the way, we will invest, and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. And that is why for me, the most important message we wanted to send out to folks today with this concept of the integrated firm. Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the two halves of the firm, will toggle by 5 or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time and now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So what I wanted to start off and Sharon with just a question on incremental margins and comp leverage in a lower rate backdrop. We know NII is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarter, certainly if the forward curve manifests, but you should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds, stronger fee base flows, a better IV backdrop. But the Street is modeling comp dollars flat, revenues up about $2 billion. I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves but the growth is coming in mainly for more compensable areas.\nSharon Yeshaya: So you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces, right? So you can't look at the different line items the same way. You're going to have a comp ratio change as FAs get compensated, as you would expect, on the grid associated with those fee-based revenues. As it relates to NII, yes, that was noncompensable as I just told you the expectation on a quarter-over-quarter basis, if client behavior remains unchanged, you are sitting in a position where you're beginning to better understand what that behavior is and that NII will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter, at least for the first quarter. So yes, the comp itself might change, but the actual growth in the ability to see the fee-based assets grow is higher. There are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year. Remember that what I highlighted was you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in the fixed income products. You add market dynamics associated with billing, et cetera. So there is place -- there are rather places that you can see growth in the asset management line. Yes, they will be compensable, but we would see benefits of scale, both from the asset side and hopefully, from the market side as you see different pieces being invested as you move forward. I hope that helps to frame the answer to your question.\nSteven Chubak: No, that's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower rates. It's a big area of focus for investors. You benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium savings where admittedly you have bigger pricing flexibility at the same time, the asset side is still very sensitive to the short end. So I wanted to get a sense as to how you expect the NII trajectory to unfold as the Fed begins easing and whether there's any appetite on your side to extend duration to maybe lock in some higher yields.\nSharon Yeshaya: That's a great question. And the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits, right? So your sort of first order condition, as you look ahead into 2024 is what happens to the deposit mix. What I said on the call is that we're encouraged in my prepared remarks, we're encouraged by what we've seen to date as the beginning of January. If you were to assume that, that were to hold, the next question is, what is the pace of the interest rate cuts that we see? If you see an instantaneous shock, we disclose to you what that means, right? So an instantaneous 100 basis point shock lower will be negative, around $600 million, right? However, if it was more gradual in nature, which is similar to what you might see in the forward curve, you will have offsets associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio. So that will offset the rate decline, right? We'll largely offset those rate declines. But it will depend first order condition is -- our deposits stable is the mix stable, and that's what we've seen so far. So let's see if that holds. And then second, what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much and good morning Ted and Sharon. Maybe just start with a question on investment banking and good to hear about the tone improvement there. Sponsors have been less active than corporates, at least from the data we track, and we know sponsors have record dry powder, but higher interest rates, current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them. So just the question is whether they are in a position to return in force over the next year. I think that's probably going to be necessary for full normalization in investment banking. And then just what you're seeing when you talk about the pipeline that you have, which are good, what are sponsors doing in those pipelines?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Overall, the pipeline is more diversified than we've necessarily seen in historical years. We expect to see continued momentum in energy that we've seen over the past year, we see optimistic signs in real estate, and we see optimistic signs in technology. As it relates to sponsors, we would expect sponsors to come back that will obviously take time, and I do think it will likely take a couple of potential prints in certain places and other things that will be encouraging will be on the equity IPO side. What I'd say is we've moved from a period of time that was window driven and that market is beginning to build momentum. And so the juxtaposition between the outlook for '24, I think in '23 is important there as well.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. And then a question for Ted. So I think you're pretty clear here, the strategic trajectory is not changing dramatically. But we often get the question around stylistically what's changing. And so you have a different background than James. I think everyone has their own management style, and you run some big businesses very successfully from Morgan Stanley. So what could maybe just hit on briefly how you would characterize kind of your style and just the ability to leverage your experience and what may change as a result of that? Thanks.\nTed Pick: Well, I\u2019d say that's a great question. James and I are more -- much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over CEO when things were in, as you know, a pretty rough shape and for now in his 15th year of leadership as Exec Chair, he brings a positive spirit to every single interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls, client interactions, cultural work with our - with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization. I think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization. It's something that I'm a big believer in and has worked well inside of the trading businesses inside of investment banking, and I think you can feel it throughout the firm. So the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values and this articulation of the integrated firm, which is the next step now because we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deep remote through these gutsy acquisitions. That brought us to a place now where we can look around and see how we can bring the firm closer together. I think the tone is one of determination. I've been at this place for more than three decades, and we had our moment sort of before the [abyss] in '08 and I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James, but also the folks that came through the organization like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days. So the calling card here is durability is consistency. We want to put up consistent results Part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back page, those are very clear numbers, and we will hit them. We will hit those numbers. It will take time. We will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with a thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which will be part of the next arrow on Page 3 and the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time, but sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James tenure, which is that of consistency and durability. So if the first is this positive mojo and the second is this ethos of consistency, rigor durability I think the third, at the end of the day, has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients, and that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels very clear on what we do and what we don't do, and that the cycle is very much a tailwind for us.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, Ted, and welcome to the call. Good morning, Sharon as well. Maybe Ted, for you, on the trading businesses, Morgan Stanley has suffered some share loss over the last couple of years and your peers have been aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share so maybe curious on how you're thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest more capital or resources into that business?\nTed Pick: Thanks for the question. Christian, good to hear your voice. I think we know that we have -- we have achieved the top three position in the Institutional Securities business over the last number of years. But as you say on the margin, we have lost share to the number 1 and number 2 and I think our view has been that, that is a trade that we've been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today. But also importantly, the preservation of capital, which allows us today irrespective of where we are in Basel III end game to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the team much focused on the durability of the dividend. And so there's been a real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley. Now that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that, if, for example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context or is there '21/'22 highs where we're about 10% away from those figures, well, then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the prime brokerage business on behalf of clients. There may be other periods where the event space, which was an illusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that, that activity may come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade in the sponsor community is dependent at some level on the street to engage in velocity. So there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank. I think what we would say in 2024 is that it's not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the insured securities business. We will engage in both activities, but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share. The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrate operating leverage in each of the two businesses and ultimately, to get to holistic returns. So we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put uses and where we can serve clients over a long period of time. We're paying attention to it very, very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that the cycle that's coming investment banking-led cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting together, and I know you've met some of these folks are so-called integrated investment bank. What is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people and fixed income folks who work together. They work together on client solutions. What I'm proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the firm. We're at -- in the wealth business, the investment management business and inside the investment bank, we can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns. And that is for me, the most exciting part of the next chapter, which is we got the team, we've got the excess capital. But again, I like the excess capital because it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on a Basel III end game. I would add if, in fact, the Basel III end game outcome is more favorable than perhaps the Street expects. We will adjust accordingly, but we have tools. And part of that is dividend or that's investing in the business. Part of that, obviously, is buying stock back. But ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from James, and that's something they should continue to expect for me.\nChristian Bolu: Awesome. Very clear, and then maybe another one on Wealth Management margins, unfortunately, maybe for Sharon. I can hear you Sharon very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time. I guess, but if I guess if I look at the business, 2019 versus today, wealth management revenues are up 50%. This is where they were in 2019, where your margins have compressed. And again, I know there's onetime items in the quarter, on the year, but it doesn't seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage. So what gives you confidence that going forward, our revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage?\nSharon Yeshaya: Really around the conversion. That's why I keep talking about the conversion, Christian. We brought the statistics up last year. We've brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from Workplace about seeing net new assets coming in and then seeing those assets migrate. New clients giving FAs time. All of those things are able to give us more durable asset management-based revenue as we move forward. So to your question, and I think Steve asked a similar question, the NII will fluctuate, obviously, based on rates and on consumer and customer behavior. And so the goal, well, that has been something that we say, don't forget the bank. Don't forget the margin that you'll get from that. Over time, the goal is to have a more sustainable $1 trillion of assets coming through both wealth and investment management, those assets will earn fees to some portion of it, and we see the migration into fee-based, right? We have 50% of advisor-led assets sitting in fee-based accounts. That's the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of scale. And we have invested in workplace. We've invested in getting new channels and getting new participants. The time is now to begin to see conversion, and we have evidence factual evidence that I pointed to on this call to show you that we're making progress towards those goals.\nTed Pick: What I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So part of it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away on assets working their way through workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business. And we will allow for some time for those assets to convert. But the key, of course, is to have them in-house and then as well to see that folks who are our new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them the firm as well\nOperator: Due to time constraints, we'll take just one question and no follow-up going forward from analysts. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning and congrats to Ted on the new role. I will -- since I only get one shot at this, I will ask on the long-term targets. So we -- there were some slight changes here. We lost some pluses and we lost a less than on the efficiency ratio, although in fairness, we gained a plus on the client assets. So was that a reflection of these are long-term targets, so I'm guessing it's not really a reflection of the current environment. So what drove the tweak there to maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios? And how should -- you've referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize, how should we be thinking about progression towards these targets? And what specific nonenvironmental actions you can be taking in order to move the ball there.\nTed Pick: Yes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like. This, for me, was sort of an easy call the page is one that we all own and getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve. And at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place. And that would be a reasonable time to say, hey, how about more. And we'd say, okay, well, clearly, we're going to continue to grow assets because the asset number way that TAM is gigantic. James has mentioned, $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come. Whether the pretax margin of wealth's should go about 30% at that point before or not, I'd like to get to the 30 and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully and the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at the business to work well at, and we believe we can when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon described and as new assets get put to work some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again, workplace coming through the funnel. All three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and new issues and the like. We should slowly and durably work our way back to 30% The efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now by definition, the investment bank which has more capital and more underlying risk should have margins that exceed 30% over time. So it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70%, 30% as well. So 30% plus could be a way of thinking about it, but I wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them. And then finally, with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital, what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back and durably how we run the place. So we thought that 20% ROTCE which is something we hit during the COVID years. But of course, those were against macroeconomic conditions, which were unusual and highly favorable that we can do 20% in a normalized environment. So this may be on the margin and James liked it too, when we talked about it, stylistically, my view was and the team shares it that 10 trillion of client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other three, effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pretax margins in wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the firm and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. It will be the challenges you would expect in making that happen. And of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way. But over time, those are the firm-wide goals, and we wanted to be very specific about that for you.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Well, it looks like you have a heavy lift after following James [indiscernible]. What is your message to the wealth managers and investment managers at half of the company that you haven't run in the past. So you've proven yourself in half the company, that's clearly capital markets and Wall Street banking. But what's your message to the other half of the company at a time when they've had a step down in their -- the growth rates, new asset flows on wealth and outflows in investment management.\nTed Pick: Well, thanks for the question, Mike. The Wealth business is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law were both brokers once upon a time, and I grew up studying that business as a kid. And I think it is absolutely that, which is differentiated on Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and build out something that's truly special is -- has been existentially, as you know better than most, but also thematically exactly what the firm as needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank. As you know, the history of our -- of our merger '97 was largely about social issues, but the industrial idea wasn't necessarily off at all. to build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and have run well and run their first-class way to deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner. And what we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein with Jed Fin and then the investment management business with Dan Simkowitz now moving over to the Investment Bank and [Ben Huneke] and [Jacques Chappuis] running investor management today is we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to nuts self-directed the traditional advisory channel and this new channel workplace are working as one. I've spent time working some of the chairman\u2019s and hitting a branch here in Midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work. And I think it's fair to say that We, at one point, we're calling the wealth and investment management business, the ballast, which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability, but I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully, you'll appreciate spirit of which I say this, I think it's actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth. If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do something inorganically. As James alluded to, perhaps that would be outside the U.S. where I spent a whole bunch of time but in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we are truly a group of one. And as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you'd be most excited about is just how well we all get along. There is a zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across wealth and investment management and across the investment bank. So the beauty of where we are today, is that all of us as shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of first-class business in a first-class way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm and is leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I said, to the $10 trillion of assets. And at the same time, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to pick up high-quality durable wallet inside the investment bank and generate operating leverage in that business, too.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ted Pick",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to affirm Morgan Stanley's strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides. Turning first to Slide 3, over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to '14, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. Transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset, and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis. In 2015 to '19, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then in 2020 to '22, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two major business lines -- wealth and investment management and institutional securities generated operating leverage and high returns. Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results. In 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to '14. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was tripled the post crisis years. Combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT, and our category of one asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability. The actions we have taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to Slide 4, since 2010, revenues and wealth and investment management have more than doubled, and today we are number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets. In wealth management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels -- advisor led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA growth to continue to vary quarter by quarter, given seasonality and even year to year given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering. Over time, our ability to track, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds in our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before, and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as parametric, private markets and value add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles. Turning to Slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our Integrated Investment bank is a preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation. Over the last decade, we have advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our market's presence. In a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the U.S., acting as a true global investment bank, is critical for the Morgan Stanley franchise. After more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors, and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity which will drive investment banking growth, and as such are particularly focused on expanding our 15% world share in that advice driven business. Turning to Slide 6. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities efficiently facilitates the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley's firmwide Solutions has never been stronger. Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C suite on strategy, to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed, up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth. Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to Slide 7. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going. The intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is particularly important. Andy, in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management, is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead institutional securities, where he spent 25 years, will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan, Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the enduring strength of our culture. Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders, we're enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by a world class technology and infrastructure organization, and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital, and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today. Turning to Slide 8, in addition to one -- the performance of the business, two -- driving an integrated firm and three -- maintaining our culture, we are four highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong, going to the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as ventured within our stress capital buffer, have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts, that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend as it is at the core of our business model's durability. While we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses, and repurchase our stock, the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four firmwide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pretax margin, a 70% firmwide efficiency ratio, and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We enter 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation in fact has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and supply chain, that could result in a stickier fed and the resulting higher for longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These risks, the geopolitical and that of the U.S. economy, present some uncertainties as we start 2024. Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle, and based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence, and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investor management, and remain committed to growing high quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world. In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you. Thanks for your question. I think we -- as you heard from my comments, we're generally constructive about what 2024 brings and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents, whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that Sharon referred to and redeploy by our wealth clients into the markets, given increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for the wealth channel. In the investment bank, we've had a decade's long route in IPOs slowest volume we've seen in decades. As you know, we've had very light M&A calendar. So that also has been at a trough sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank, specifically inside of investment banking, we think, in order to our benefit to. So we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. Ultimately, we are in the tickets business activity based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment but also for the investment bank. And part of the reason I wanted to talk about the integrated firm today was because the two segments are working together will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities in the firm. We have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business. We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia. So if economic conditions are better than the expected, which is that Europe will struggle in China might as well. If we do any better than that, we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions, too. So it's not just a U.S. proposition but a global one as well. Thanks. Good to talk to you -- with you. It's an interesting question. You're effectively asking what will over the slide look like three, four years from now. We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or '21, where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders. Again, early economy type of activity, and that could grow again towards 50%. And we could have other periods where as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm, that could expand further. I think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the firm is in wealth and investment management is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I want to convey today is that while there is a change in leadership after 14 years of James stewardship, there's not a change in strategy. We have undertaken and integrated, if you really go back into time and then include Mesa West five different acquisitions. And I think the view inside the house is that's good for now. We can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us and it feels organic. Now that having been said, there are ideas that come across the transom and we naturally would take a look. But I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently. I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more. There's a little more work to be done post integration where there could be inefficiencies along the income statement. And I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in wealth and 70% efficiency of the firm. The way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate -- we will achieve those goals. But along the way, we will invest, and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. And that is why for me, the most important message we wanted to send out to folks today with this concept of the integrated firm. Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the two halves of the firm, will toggle by 5 or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time and now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit. Well, I'd say that's a great question. James and I are more -- much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over CEO when things were in, as you know, a pretty rough shape and for now in his 15th year of leadership as Exec Chair, he brings a positive spirit to every single interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls, client interactions, cultural work with our - with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization. I think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization. It's something that I'm a big believer in and has worked well inside of the trading businesses inside of investment banking, and I think you can feel it throughout the firm. So the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values and this articulation of the integrated firm, which is the next step now because we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deep remote through these gutsy acquisitions. That brought us to a place now where we can look around and see how we can bring the firm closer together. I think the tone is one of determination. I've been at this place for more than three decades, and we had our moment sort of before the [abyss] in '08 and I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James, but also the folks that came through the organization like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days. So the calling card here is durability is consistency. We want to put up consistent results Part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back page, those are very clear numbers, and we will hit them. We will hit those numbers. It will take time. We will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with a thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which will be part of the next arrow on Page 3 and the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time, but sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James tenure, which is that of consistency and durability. So if the first is this positive mojo and the second is this ethos of consistency, rigor durability I think the third, at the end of the day, has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients, and that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels very clear on what we do and what we don't do, and that the cycle is very much a tailwind for us. Thanks for the question. Christian, good to hear your voice. I think we know that we have -- we have achieved the top three position in the Institutional Securities business over the last number of years. But as you say on the margin, we have lost share to the number 1 and number 2 and I think our view has been that, that is a trade that we've been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today. But also importantly, the preservation of capital, which allows us today irrespective of where we are in Basel III end game to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the team much focused on the durability of the dividend. And so there's been a real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley. Now that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that, if, for example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context or is there '21/'22 highs where we're about 10% away from those figures, well, then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the prime brokerage business on behalf of clients. There may be other periods where the event space, which was an illusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that, that activity may come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade in the sponsor community is dependent at some level on the street to engage in velocity. So there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank. I think what we would say in 2024 is that it's not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the insured securities business. We will engage in both activities, but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share. The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrate operating leverage in each of the two businesses and ultimately, to get to holistic returns. So we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put uses and where we can serve clients over a long period of time. We're paying attention to it very, very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that the cycle that's coming investment banking-led cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting together, and I know you've met some of these folks are so-called integrated investment bank. What is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people and fixed income folks who work together. They work together on client solutions. What I'm proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the firm. We're at -- in the wealth business, the investment management business and inside the investment bank, we can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns. And that is for me, the most exciting part of the next chapter, which is we got the team, we've got the excess capital. But again, I like the excess capital because it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on a Basel III end game. I would add if, in fact, the Basel III end game outcome is more favorable than perhaps the Street expects. We will adjust accordingly, but we have tools. And part of that is dividend or that's investing in the business. Part of that, obviously, is buying stock back. But ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from James, and that's something they should continue to expect for me. What I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So part of it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away on assets working their way through workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business. And we will allow for some time for those assets to convert. But the key, of course, is to have them in-house and then as well to see that folks who are our new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them the firm as well Yes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like. This, for me, was sort of an easy call the page is one that we all own and getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve. And at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place. And that would be a reasonable time to say, hey, how about more. And we'd say, okay, well, clearly, we're going to continue to grow assets because the asset number way that TAM is gigantic. James has mentioned, $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come. Whether the pretax margin of wealth's should go about 30% at that point before or not, I'd like to get to the 30 and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully and the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at the business to work well at, and we believe we can when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon described and as new assets get put to work some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again, workplace coming through the funnel. All three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and new issues and the like. We should slowly and durably work our way back to 30% The efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now by definition, the investment bank which has more capital and more underlying risk should have margins that exceed 30% over time. So it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70%, 30% as well. So 30% plus could be a way of thinking about it, but I wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them. And then finally, with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital, what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back and durably how we run the place. So we thought that 20% ROTCE which is something we hit during the COVID years. But of course, those were against macroeconomic conditions, which were unusual and highly favorable that we can do 20% in a normalized environment. So this may be on the margin and James liked it too, when we talked about it, stylistically, my view was and the team shares it that 10 trillion of client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other three, effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pretax margins in wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the firm and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. It will be the challenges you would expect in making that happen. And of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way. But over time, those are the firm-wide goals, and we wanted to be very specific about that for you. Well, thanks for the question, Mike. The Wealth business is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law were both brokers once upon a time, and I grew up studying that business as a kid. And I think it is absolutely that, which is differentiated on Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and build out something that's truly special is -- has been existentially, as you know better than most, but also thematically exactly what the firm as needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank. As you know, the history of our -- of our merger '97 was largely about social issues, but the industrial idea wasn't necessarily off at all. to build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and have run well and run their first-class way to deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner. And what we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein with Jed Fin and then the investment management business with Dan Simkowitz now moving over to the Investment Bank and [Ben Huneke] and [Jacques Chappuis] running investor management today is we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to nuts self-directed the traditional advisory channel and this new channel workplace are working as one. I've spent time working some of the chairman's and hitting a branch here in Midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work. And I think it's fair to say that We, at one point, we're calling the wealth and investment management business, the ballast, which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability, but I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully, you'll appreciate spirit of which I say this, I think it's actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth. If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do something inorganically. As James alluded to, perhaps that would be outside the U.S. where I spent a whole bunch of time but in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we are truly a group of one. And as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you'd be most excited about is just how well we all get along. There is a zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across wealth and investment management and across the investment bank. So the beauty of where we are today, is that all of us as shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of first-class business in a first-class way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm and is leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I said, to the $10 trillion of assets. And at the same time, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to pick up high-quality durable wallet inside the investment bank and generate operating leverage in that business, too."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks all for joining us. As anticipated, the market environment in aggregate remained mixed continuing a pattern we've seen over the past several quarters. Notwithstanding, the net result for Morgan Stanley was regenerated $13 billion, a little over $13 billion in revenues, $2.3 billion in net income, and ROTCE of 13.5%. The concerns around a tight employment market, high commodity prices, inflationary pressures that may impact Fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter. But we are seeing increasing evidence of M&A and underwriting calendars that are building and while we expect momentum to continue this year, given the fourth quarter has some seasonal considerations, we expect most of the activity to materialize in 2024. Meanwhile, it's our job to control what we can control. Firstly, we successfully completed the E-Trade integration this quarter. That was a massive undertaking, and the expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the P&L for a couple of years, it involved us migrating 14 million accounts onto our platform and honestly it went incredibly well, really a seamless performance by the team. This conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy, building our revenue synergies across channels, and attracting clients to our best-in-class advice offering. Secondly, on the capital front, we bought back 1.5 billion in stock. We averaged a nearly 4% dividend yield over the quarter, and at the same time, delivered a CET1 ratio of 15.5%, which is 260 basis points over our most recent regulatory requirement. We clearly have a significant capital buffer. Also, you saw the full details of the initial Basel III endgame proposal. As you all know, this is a proposal, not the final regulation. And I'm going to repeat that, it\u2019s a proposal. There is an enormous amount of energy being spent, conversations being had across industry groups and agency board members and I've been deeply involved myself along with Sharon Yeshaya and we've been told many times that the Federal Reserve strongly welcomes comments on this proposal. Given this, I anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before it's adopted as a final rule. But let me be crystal clear, because of the buffers we have built, even if this proposal were implemented today as written, we have adequate capital to meet the ultimate requirement. Needless to say there are many years between now and then. In the quarter, wealth management generated net new assets of $36 billion, that's obviously below recent quarters. It's consistent with what I've been saying for a long time. These numbers will bounce around and in any quarterly period, they're always idiosyncratic things. This year we've had two quarters where we had some surprise on the upside and in aggregate for the year, we're totally net new assets of $235 billion year-to-date. Our annualized growth rate is at the high end of the 5% to 7% range that we've been looking at. And it's consistent, in fact, it's spot on with our three-year target of a trillion dollars for net new money. Overall, this firm is in excellent shape, notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in. My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean as slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months. I'm very excited about the future of this firm, its leadership, its strategy, and its culture. And I'll now turn it over to Sharon, who can discuss the quarter in greater detail. And then together, as always, we'll take your questions. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.3 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.38 and our ROTCE was 13.5%. Results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. Together, severance and DCP impacted the year-to-date efficiency ratio by nearly 150 basis points. As we invest for growth, our integration efforts have remained a priority. Integration-related expenses were $68 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter as previously communicated. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues were $5.7 billion, declining 3% versus the prior year. Equity and fixed income results were in line with long-term historical averages. Investment banking revenues remained depressed on lower volume. However, leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progress positively, evidenced by a notable increase of Morgan Stanley's announced volumes in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues decreased to $938 million. The change to the previous year was driven by lower results in advisory and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues of $449 million reflected a decline in completed transactions, due to lower announced volumes in prior periods. Despite the weaker quarterly results, we continue to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern. Equity underwriting revenues were $237 million. Overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages. While increased confidence supported early September issuances, a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, and resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains window-driven. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $252 million down versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower non-investment grade events. We are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bake-off activity across sectors and geographies. The pickup in our announced M&A volumes in the third quarter speak to the trends we've observed at the end of the last quarter. But the landscape continues to evolve. As we look ahead, corporate confidence will largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs. While risks remain, including geopolitical threats, the underlying trends suggest activity is building and there is a desire among clients to pursue their long-term strategic objectives. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion. The business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in Europe and Asia. Prime brokerage revenues were solid. Client balances were modestly higher, compared to last year. The results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances. Cash revenues declined versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes. Derivative results increased year-over-year, reflecting higher client activity with particular strength in Europe. Fixed income revenues were $1.9 billion. Micro results increased versus the prior year, supported by strength in securitized products, both in agency and non-agency trading. Macro revenues decreased versus last year's elevated results with lower revenues and rates in foreign exchange. Results reflect lower client conviction, particularly around the future of central bank policy. Commodity revenues increase year-over-year on the back of a constructive trading environment, particularly for oil. Other revenues of $277 million improved versus last year, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, net of loan hedges, and higher net interest income and fees. Turning to ISG lending and provision. The allowance for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments increased slightly to $1.4 billion. In the quarter ISG provisions were $93 million. The increase was driven by a continued negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector. Net charge-offs were $39 million, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan in the office sector. Turning to wealth management, revenues of $6.4 billion were strong, an increase from the prior year. The growth of asset management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income, underscoring their durability. As designed, our asset led strategy provides steady fee-based flows that support asset management revenues. With this in mind, we remain focused on asset migration into our advisor led channel. This quarter, our long-term strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our E-Trade integration, successfully converting nearly $900 billion of client AUM onto the Morgan Stanley platform. This will continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisors and seamlessly transition them into advice-based relationships. Moving on to the business metrics in the third quarter, pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.7%. Integration expenses, as well as DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 150 basis points. Net new assets were $36 billion, bringing year-to-date NNA to $235 billion, which represents over 7% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net recruiting into the advisor led channel. The multi-year buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our advisor led channel, evidence by fee-based flows of $22.5 billion in the third quarter alone. Asset management revenues of $3.6 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Higher average assets and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows over the past year drove the increase. Transactional revenues excluding DCP were $820 million, up 7% year-over-year. Results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail clients into alternatives, particularly into private equity and private credit. Bank lending balances roughly flat versus the prior quarter. Growth in mortgages and tailored lending offset paydowns and securities-based lending. Total deposits of $340 billion remain stable, compared to the prior quarter. Still, the deposit mix has shifted as clients continue to allocate rate-sensitive cash to higher-yielding cash alternatives available on the platform, including our expanded savings offering. In addition, the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances, ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment. Net interest income was $2 billion. The sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix. Looking towards the rest of this year, based on where we exited the quarter, we expect NII to trend lower. The magnitude will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates. The wealth management business model is focused on steady asset aggregation, delivering strong solutions and advice to clients, while growing durable fees and expanding margin through the cycle. We are continuing to invest in our industry-leading position and the sustainability of our long-term growth. As the backdrop recovers, advisors remain well-positioned to capture greater asset opportunity supported by our multi-channel model that was built to attract new client relationships. Turning to investment management, revenues of $1.3 billion increased 14%, compared to the prior year, supported by higher asset management revenues. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our [Technical Difficulty] active equity growth strategies, which continue to see redemption consistent with the industry. Including the segment's outflows, year-to-date long-term flows across the franchise were slightly positive. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies, a partial offset to the headwinds of the quarter. Liquidity and overlay services had net flows of $5.7 billion, driven by demand for parametric institutional portfolio overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies. Specific to parametric and across the entire franchise, overlay and long-term net flows in the quarter were almost $7 billion, underscoring strong trends in this business. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year on higher average AUM. Performance-based income and other revenues were $24 million, supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light platform. Results were driven by gains in U.S. private equity, offset by weakness in Asia private equity and real estate. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place. Ongoing investments in our businesses, including our market-leading parametric franchise, as well as our continued growth and innovation in private markets, position us well to best serve our clients. Turning to the balance sheet, our CET-1 ratio stands at 15.5%, roughly flat versus last quarter. Standardized RWA has declined sequentially to $445 billion, reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market movements at the end of the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1.5 billion of common stock during the quarter. Taken in the context of the mixed environment, we are pleased with the firm's resiliency and our competitive positioning. As clients gain more conviction, we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities, particularly in investment banking. This increased client conviction will also further support asset growth and wealth and investment management. We will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies all while currently managing our capital profile. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, James and Sharon. I wanted to just touch on wealth management, a bit of a longer-term question here. As you mentioned, you've enjoyed really strong organic growth in that segment over the last few years. But it doesn't appear to be translating to revenue growth. If I look at the wealth management revenues excluding NII, it hasn't really grown in three years, despite gathering significant amount of assets? So curious how you're thinking about the flow through from AUM or asset growth to revenues? And then maybe more broadly how you're thinking about the unit economics of your asset gathering strategy?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure, actually I think that interestingly enough Christian I'm pretty impressed with the resiliency that we've seen in the business. This is literally the explanation of the funnel that we've talked about. If you look back over the course of the last year alone $260 billion or $235 billion of assets that we've captured. Then look at the fee-based flows, right? We continue to see increased fee-based flows. This past year, if you exclude the asset acquisitions that we had over the last couple of years, we are basically at some of the historical highs of seeing fee-based growth as we move forward. You're looking at times since COVID, where we obviously had very high retail engagement, and you've been able to offset, even with a decline in NII, offset those growths to asset-based, asset management revenues as you move forward. It's that, that we are trying to grow. We're trying to continue to grow our asset management fees over time and make sure that we have the right solutions in place to offer our clients. Now let's take that forward. We have this mixed environment. You have 23% of our retail client assets sitting in cash, that is 5% higher, right, from the 18% on historical averages. We've begun to see retail investors put their cash into markets. The last four months -- in consecutively, we've seen that movement into the market. This quarter alone, we began to see alternative growth in the new products, the growth in transactional revenues. We haven't seen that since the first quarter of 2022 before you started this rate hike cycle. So in my mind, actually the strategy is working pretty darn well, especially if you think about how we've been able to aggregate assets, migrate them into fee-based flows, look at transactional and see that growth -- and see growth in these new products and deliver them to our clients, all while these clients have dry powder to invest as these markets turn.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thanks, Sharon. Maybe my follow-up is just thinking about your ROTCE targets over time of 20%. You know, the quarter is fine, 14% is nothing to sniff at, but it is some ways off that 20%. How should we think about the bridge from here? I know you've mentioned investment banking, but it seems like a fairly small part of your business. So what's the bridge to 20%? How much of it is macro? How much of it is self-help? And for what is macro, what sort of operating backdrop are you looking for? Thank you.\nJames Gorman: Well, Christian, maybe I take that given Sharon just pummeled you and I want to give you a little bit of a break here. By the way, the only thing I'd add to what Sharon said is when people have a choice of making a 4%, 5% return by doing nothing, they're not going to be trading in the other market. So the actual secondary lines in the revenues of the lowest I've seen for years in the last couple of years as rates do eventually come down, they will come down, I don't think next year, but they'll come down after that. You'll see more activity in that regard and actually you'll see more money go up in the sweep. So interestingly, there's kind of an optimal point where rates are attractive for investors, but not so high they keep them out of the market and not so high that there isn't money kept on sweep. So very different from the checking account phenomenon you see at some of the commercial banks. But back to the 20%, I mean, I just say, as you know, we actually, we were at 20%. So it's not -- this is not a -- this would not be a remarkable achievement. It's a bit like when I first came to Morgan Stanley and people asked me if the wealth management business could generate, in those days 15% margins. And I said, well, there are two people already doing it, so it's pretty obvious it can be done. So we've done it and nothing structural has changed. If anything, the firm's got stronger, we've been investing a lot. I mean, this E-Trade deal was, you know, it was a lot of investment to get that integration done. We decided to keep investing through the cycle on the funnel and wealth, because we think over the next 10-years that's going to pay monster dividends. The integration across all the Eaton Vance platforms, they were never really integrated as one platform across the different, you know, Atlanta, Calvert, Parametric and Eaton Vance and now sorting through all of that, which Dan has done a great job of doing. And then frankly, banking has been really weak. I mean, under a billion dollars is evidence of a very weak calendar and very weak M&A. And the pipeline we saw this quarter was really strong. So I don't think the announcements won't translate into revenues in Q4, but they will in Q1, Q2 next year. So just on the math, I think if we're running about $2.2 billion we'd have to generate about another $700 million net a quarter. Just on the expense management, we could do things on expenses easily, more than we've done. And you could get a couple of hundred million from that. And then on the revenue side, as banking recovers, some of the transaction stuff we just talked about and Sharon pointed out, these assets moving into a pneumatized product. And then I think Fed will move up from this point. You pretty easily get to the 20%. So I appreciate the question and I'm not concerned about that long-term outlook. I think it's -- as it has happened and will happen again and frankly won't be that long.\nOperator: We'll go Next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. Sharon, first one on wealth management and NII. I mean, the trends I think are in the range of what's been happening across the industry. So not overly surprising. But I'm curious if you could break down even qualitatively how much of that sweep movement is coming in historical mortgage family versus E-Trade? I'm just trying to see what type of client is moving? And then to go back, you piqued my interest, James, in the comment you just made about not next year, but maybe after that. What conditions do you think we need to see for wealth management NII to stable and grow?\nSharon Yeshaya: So let's take the first question, which is the two different types of deposit mix. You're right, you know, from a -- if you think about the self-directed client versus a advisory-based client that we've had in the historical wealth management franchise, one has proven to be somewhat of a stickier deposit base than you would see on the wealth management side. And I think that, you know, on the -- what I would say is the traditional wealth management side that we had historically had. So that does provide you with a sense of what's going on in terms of which client base is seeing that. On the potential growth of NII going forward, again, that's part of the same asset gathering strategy. Some proportion of these assets as they come over, be that into the self-directed or the advice-based relationship, will be held in some sort of transactional cash. So that will be supportive over time of NII to some degree from a deposit perspective. But that also provides us with lending capabilities and opportunities. As you know, Glenn, we've seen tremendous, what we would call, sort of, household penetration in being able to offer new lending products to our various client bases, obviously with the SBL product. But we continue to see mortgages and growth in mortgages even in this right environment for new purchases and homes. As we better understand our client base, we're able to do that more. And actually bringing together this E-Trade acquisition, putting everything on the same portfolio and the same franchise from a technology perspective is foundational and being able to integrate all of those bank relationships and what we used to call the bank rails that E-Trade had for a broader wealth offering that should also help support NII as we look into the future.\nJames Gorman: I think I don't know. On the second bit, I just think there's an optimal point. I mean, we went from zero rates to 5% in effectively the fastest period since the 60s, early 70s, fastest rate increase. What's remarkable is we haven't had a recession, by the way, but -- and I personally don't think we're going to. But with that, I mean, if you're an advisor and you've got a client sitting on a lot of cash earnings zero, I would hope you're telling them to put it in treasuries or something. So that's exactly what's happened. At around 2% to 3%, it becomes a different kind of discussion. So I think there's a trigger point and you're seeing it across, as you said, the whole industry and that's why you're seeing a different behavior set for people in checking accounts where they haven't gone to buy the money sitting in the checking account. If they're not paying attention, they're still getting, I don't know, 20 basis points or something. So as rates come down, the total cash we have in the book, which is 23%, will be coming down anyway, because it's just -- that's an abnormality related to where rates are right now. As rates come down over the next couple of years, you're actually going to see people much less price sensitive on what they're generating in a return on the cash and just using it as a liquidity account to manage investments going in and out. So I think in some ways we overachieved relative to our particular business mix. So I'm quite encouraged about the future because of that. And think, in fact, you're hearing some of that language coming out of the banks where they said, I forget what the words some of the other CEOs said, but it was effectively the same. They've overachieved in that it's sitting in checking accounts and they're making an enormous amount of money on that, but that's unsustainable. We've overachieved in that rates are so high, everybody wanted to be in cash, earning not cash sitting dormant. I don't know if that makes sense to you, Glenn. By the way I have to say I did love your comment about, you know, Paul talked about green shoots, somebody forgot to water them. I'd give you that one.\nGlenn Schorr: That's better than a pummel. Thank you. Onde quick one, maybe I'll get the pummel on this one. I know it's the board decision, but the longer the CEO transition announcement takes place, is there any timeframe where it starts to put more strain on the organization or become a distraction as every reporter in the world is writing on it every day?\nJames Gorman: Yes, about three years from now. No, wait, listen, Glenn, come on. We said I will not be CEO, I said at the annual meeting I wouldn't be CEO within a year. And I said that for a very simple reason that people didn't believe that I was going to leave because apparently bank CEOs don't. And I said I would and when I say I'm going to do something, I'm definitely going to do it. I would leave at the earliest possible moment that the board feels comfortable making that decision. And I've made that very clear to them. I think they've done a terrific job. Now that you've opened up the question, I'll answer it more broadly. They've done a terrific job. Dennis Nally and the succession comp committee and Tom Glocer, lead director on the board, all the directors engaged, really thorough process. And I don't want to give you an exact time, because that's sort of a spoiler. I already did that apparently talking about Logan Roy once. But we\u2019re -- shall I say we're well into it. And I do believe there are diminishing returns at some point in time. We're not there. The team is doing great. The businesses are moving forward. But yes, I want to get out of the seat and give somebody else a chance to see what they can do with it. And I think there's a lot of things, the growth opportunities in this company, now that we've set it up with so many planks that are solid, you have an abundance of choices. And I just, you know, just look at what we've done with MUFG in Japan, the so-called 2.0 that you know, Ted has been driving with Hero, the CEO of MUFG of taking our Japanese business with them to a completely different level and I think there's a lot of things we can do with them in Japan strategically taking advantage of the turnaround of the Japanese economy. That's just one example. So yes, we're getting close. I'm certainly not a barrier to it. I'm a -- I don't know if the word's enabler, but I'd like to get on with it, and I'll help in the transition as Executive Chairman for a bit, and this place will go forth and thrive.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on something you said, James, around the optimal level of rates, and you talked about NII. But if the Fed were to hike a few more times, or if rates stay at these levels for longer, is there an argument to be made that just structurally the business will be challenged until we get to the other side of the rate cycle, given just client assets probably remain in lower spread products? Just talk to us in terms of how you think about if rates don't get cut, is that a headwind to the business until we get to the other side?\nJames Gorman: No, I definitely don't think there's a structural issue. I mean, my goodness, the business is generating, I'm talking about wealth 26% margins with the various costs in there, and I think it's 28% Sharon without them. If you'd told me a few years ago, I mean, I thought we'd get to 28%, but pretty much nobody else in the world did. So, no, there's no structural issue here -- there. I'm just saying as a -- and I do think if, at the risk of making prediction, I suspect the Fed will do one more rate increase at some, you know, by the end of the year, I guess November. But that's likely to be it. And I do not expect the Fed to cut rates in 2024, but I do expect going forward after that. So given that, we're talking about 12-months. The cash is largely moved. It's moved, you know, on the margin you're going to have a little bit of NII impact over the next 12-months, but that's really not the real game. The real game is go forward after that. So, and the minute you see the Fed indicate they've stopped raising rates, the M&A and underwriting calendar will explode, because there is enormous pent-up activity. But Boards of directors are sitting there and saying, until we understand the cost of financing, it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital transactions. So I think you're heading into, and unfortunately I'm not going to be around to enjoy it, but you're heading into a really good patch here. And I don't know if it's six months out or nine months out or it starts three months out, but this thing is going to start turning and then rates will be the kick when they start coming down. And as I said people will be less focused on cash and accounts and more focused on investment opportunities, that's when you're going to see the double kicker.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. I guess a good time for you to hand off. Your successor will be thanking you for that. But a quick question\u2026\nJames Gorman: I hope so.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I think, Sharon, you mentioned about focus on secular growth, I think international expansion, E-Trade is done now. I'm assuming you're not doing any big M&A anytime soon. Just talk to us about international expansion, a lot of disruption on wealth management, private banking globally, what the opportunities are, where we are investing. We'd love some color around that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Investing more broadly internationally, James mentioned the deals or what we've been working on, I should say, MUFG 2.0 between research and also our sales and trading side. We continue to look for opportunities. We have Arun Kohli, who's been working on our India franchise. I think that there are clearly opportunities there. Within India, we see a lot of opportunities throughout Asia. We've discussed different opportunities also all across the international franchise in Europe. So when you look at, think about investment management. That was one of the key points that we had talked about potential distribution of investment management Eaton Vance products all over Europe. We've seen that. We continue to see products with Calvert, with various active ETFs that we're seeing all across Europe again. And we've been raising new AUM there. So there are ways to distribute product across different geographies. There's a way to work with our strategic partners in places like Japan. There are ways to organically take advantage and move forward in places of growth that have more secular growth trends such as India. So there are tremendous opportunities where we see that we can take, like I said, product-client relationship and also work across institutional securities and various places in investment management. Dan Simkowitz has talked a lot about that of raising funds through those partnerships and being able to look for ways to work together to also source talent internationally as we work across the organization.\nJames Gorman: And I just said, I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, we're opening an office in Abu Dhabi. If you think of the combination Middle East, India, Japan, kind of, offsetting what's going on in China. And then strategically, I would be very surprised if this firm doesn't do some transactions in both wealth and asset management over the next three years outside the U.S. I think we have a game plan for it. Strategically, the team has worked on a lot of ideas. And obviously, we want to make sure when we do it, we're, you know, we're fully ready and we understand all of the, you know, the diligence issues around some of these relationships and careful about that, but I think the opportunities are clearly there.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on flows. Obviously feed-based flows strong in the quarter, but the total flow number came in and understanding the environment was a bit softer here in the third quarter? Could you maybe talk about the channels where the pullback was seen the most? You didn't mention workplace, so I'm not sure you would love some color there as well?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, we've talked -- thanks Dan for the question. We have talked about the fact that within the workplace channel, I think both in the first and second quarter, I've been asked about it. And it is people are using some of that cash. We aren't necessarily seeing that movement directly into people's accounts and they're seeing actual, you know, taking the stock that they might get and actually selling it rather than investing on it, given what's going on with the economic environment, potentially inflation, et cetera. So that's, you know, potentially a theme out there. But obviously, that's dependent on the market. What is more exciting in my mind is actually where we did see the increase in NNA, which was on new clients and recruiting. So those were the two strongest components. And the ability to attract new clients, I've said it before on these calls, if you asked me five years ago, well before we bought E-Trade and when we were just looking at the beginning of the modern wealth platform, many people ask how will you ever grow, because we weren't seeing new clients coming into the institution. The investments that we've made across the technology for wealth management has been what's been able to attract new recruits. So if you talk to recruits about why they come to Morgan Stanley, it's the projects they can offer, it's the technology that we have, it's the ability to work with the clients. So you're seeing that continue and then you're also seeing new client acquisition through the funnel. So those are all positive metrics. And again, you see that in the stock plan participants rising as well.\nDan Fannon: Great, thank you. And then just a follow-up on investment banking and understanding the environment isn't ideal, but you did talk about increase in announcements. So I was hoping you could provide some context maybe on the sponsor community and maybe how those conversations are happening? And just overall backlog levels versus kind of last quarter.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, the backlog itself, we've continued to rise and to build. Overall, over the course of the year, we've talked a lot about sort of being at some of the highest levels that we've seen across all of the underwriting or on the advisory side. So all of that is optimistic. Financial sponsors, we have talked about dry powder, continue to see that. Obviously, there was some valuation gaps and as James said, the more clarity that we see around the stabilization of rates, the easier that will be around deployment. And then some key themes that we have witnessed when we look at the backlog or we think about the transactions that are happening. One is the financial sector consolidation, that's a theme that's emerging within our pipeline and our discussions in the boardroom. The second is the energy transitions. That, again, that is important to some of the transactions that we have worked on and that we've talked through. And in addition to that, we are seeing emerging themes around technology, around AI, around how companies want to use that when they're thinking about strategic focus and objectives. And all of these themes are part and parcel to the fact that you can see there\u2019s -- it's a diversified backlog. And we're investing in the franchise. We've made some key hires to help us navigate through this more complex landscape and places where we see opportunities to execute as we move forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning, James. Good morning, Sharon.\nJames Gorman: Good morning.\nSharon Yeshaya: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start with a question on just the expense and margin outlook. Expenses were actually well managed in the quarter. But one of your peers did talk about competition intensifying in terms of the war for talent within investment banking and trading. It feels like that's been the case for the better part of a number of years in wealth management. And I was hoping you could just speak to your expense growth outlook and your confidence in terms of your ability to achieve the firm-wide margin target of 30%?\nSharon Yeshaya: So, when you think about the expenses, we have been looking at expenses through the cycle. We've unfortunately, you know, we have taken actions. We took actions both at the end of last year and then we took one in the spring as well. We've discussed those severance costs throughout the course of the year. And so we've been managing our expense base to better understand and to sort of think about it against the backdrop of what environment are we seeing. So while there is -- there is always a war for talent. We do pay for talent and we pay competitively for that talent, but we have to think about it in the context of where we see the potential growth opportunities. And that is also, we have to take into account the investments that we're making. And that's around processes and investing in technology. And when you look at the technology that we're investing in, we should see operating efficiencies and leverage as you go forward. So that's modernization of the plant. You're going to have optimization, and you're also going to work on things like making sure that you have the right risk and control framework to give ourselves an opportunity to grow. So just what it means to boil it down is it's a balance, right, of investing for the future, but also making sure that you have the right expense base, rather, as you move forward and you can take advantage and see those efficiency gains. And really the operating leverage that James is talking about as we move forward through the cycle.\nJames Gorman: I'll just say one thing on the war for talent. Yes, I mean, obviously, really high performers are in demand across the street. But we've actually had the opposite issue. We've had very low attrition, which is why we did some of the expense initiatives that Sharon talked about. And I guess we should feel flattered. It's a reflection of the culture and the stability of the firm. But also, that's why we took the initiatives, because you've got to bring in talented people and new generations to keep growing this place. So one's these and two's these, yes, you can lose somebody, a senior person here or there and we've hired a bunch in banking insurance, but the broader across the 80,000 people we've got is the broader messages attrition has been remarkably low and that's something that, you know, we just got to work through.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great and for my follow-up just a question on capital, James you noted that pro forma Basel III endgame, your capital requirements approximate your current capital base. How much capital cushion do you plan on running with? Also, how it informs your buyback? And you addressed a question on ROTCE targets, curious about 20% target contemplates higher capital under Basel III. So I know there's a lot in there, capital cushion, buyback level 20% ROTCE target?\nJames Gorman: I'm going to have to write this down. There's an old guy, there's a lot to remember. It's not going to affect ROTCE. We're not going to be increasing capital. So that one you can put to bed. The cushion, you know, it's a function where the rules come out. I mean, I've been very clear about this day one. I do not believe the proposal as is will be what we see when the comment period is over. I do not believe that. I have no special insight except that obviously I spent a lot of time with the regulatory community, which I've done for 14-years. I think everybody understands for example the way operating risk RWAs have been calculated in a sort of blunt instrument based on fees is not, you know, it wasn't what Basel was originally going to do though. We're going to take that rule out years ago. And they ended up just not getting around to it. And suddenly we're complying with something that they didn't even want and don't, you know, they don't use in Europe. So it\u2019s not that -- it\u2019s just not going to happen the way it is. And that's not being pollyannaish. That's just, that's my judgment call. That said, what we want to frame with investors is, god forbid, it does happen exactly as is. The rule becomes proposal rule tomorrow, then we're fine. So we're certainly not going to be raising capital. We're going to continue with our buyback through this period. The final implementation of this thing is going to be 2028. You know, there's a lot that's going to happen between now and then. But listen, this is the first time you've had members of the Fed Board and the FDIC, I think, come out in advance of a rule being promulgated, if that's the word, saying that they're not comfortable with it. So there's clearly debate within the regulatory institutions. And if you get past the -- why we need more capital, which I don't think the industry does, into well what should it be, the only place it clearly shouldn't be is punishing businesses that have fees attached to them, whether it's credit cards or wealth management, that's not the regulatory intent. And they've told me that and therefore I believe that will change. So on the cushion it's frankly a function of, you know, where the rule ends up. We'll carry whatever appropriate prudent cushion we need to carry. On do we create more capital? No, not unless we grow the business to reflect that, that we can put it to work. And thirdly, will we continue buybacks? Yes, and I'm sure Sharon can give more play from what we think about on the buyback side and dividends for that matter.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, on the capital return strategy, we've been really clear that we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Dan said that at the September conference, even when you think about all Basel, we first and foremost, we've talked about the dividend strategy. We doubled our dividend a few years ago and we've continually increased the dividend. That increase has been reflective of the growth and stable revenues that we've had more broadly as an institution. Then, of course, buyback, we're committed to a buyback, but the size of a buyback is always going to be opportunistic when you think about what the alternatives are for capital usage, right? So what are the opportunities that we see going forward and will make the right decision for what we think the right decision is for the company and for our shareholders around the uses of the capital. But we increased the buyback this quarter. So that shows you sort of how we feel about being able to return capital to our shareholders when you compare this quarter over the course of last quarter, moving from $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on the E-Trade conversion, I'm sure good to get on the other side of that. And you spoke to some of the benefits, I think more on the flow side and revenue side. Just curious if there's any -- in a more material expense saving opportunities, just assuming there's probably some redundancies there that can be removed, and then any other efficiencies that might exist?\nSharon Yeshaya: Look, we haven't really -- this deal was never contemplated from a cost synergy perspective. It's really been around revenue synergies. Will there be potential savings on the margin? It's possible. But that's not really the point of the transaction. What I think is more fundamentally interesting is that a couple of things when you think about the E-Trade integration, other than the fact that it went very smoothly as it relates to the clients themselves, it creates a really clear foundation when we're trying to migrate clients from channels and move them. So give somebody from an E-Trade channel or a self-directed channel and say, let's make an introduction to an FA and begin that potential migration. If you're on the same platform, it's a much easier and much more seamless transition. So that's a positive use of that. That's an example of how being on the same platform is helpful. The same goes for workplace, right? Everything flows into the same places. Again, that should be helpful as we move forward. It's also very helpful from a bank rails perspective. So as we think about banking products, as you can use, remember E-Trade had bank rails on their platform. Again, a lot of that can be used as we are now looking to potentially grow portions of the bank or grow lending or grow deposits. Those are all things that now that the platforms are put together on a consolidated basis. So I would look at it more from a revenue synergy perspective than necessarily a cost synergy perspective.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Thanks, Sharon. Quick follow-up here just on an interest income trajectory in GWM. So, we can make some assumptions around the trajectory of deposits, but how should we be thinking about the asset yield trajectory from here if we use the forward curve? I guess what are some of the puts and takes to be thinking about there?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, again, so when I look -- I would look at the movement sweeps, if you're trying to draw a relationship between sweeps and NII really over the last two quarters, the asset yields are going to be a function of what the market yields are. Last quarter, for example, I mentioned that we had the NII was supported by higher asset yields. You'll remember that when we walked out of the first quarter, we were in a position where there was still a regional banking crisis. Some of the yields were higher, as you think about funding yields, simply because of what was going on in the environment. As those yields normalized, that came down, you lost some of that asset yield, and you began to see what we, you know, a different kind of, the deposits themselves had a bigger, more prominent reaction when you look at a sequential change in NII. So what I would try and do is you should take both quarters, for example, into consideration when you're thinking about the relationship between sweeps in NII. And of course, asset yields will be determined by market factors more broadly.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, James and Sharon. Thanks for taking my questions. Would like to start, you know, similar to that last question. So there's clearly uncertainty, but also it seems equally clear that NII is no longer a tailwind for wealth. So when you're thinking about the 30% pre-tax margin target that you've provided for that business? How do you think, what are your plans given that tailwind may be turning into a headwind or at least moderating? And how are you calibrating any planned investment and balance that out with the potential for growth on the back of that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Thanks for the question, Brennan. As you would expect, it's a balance, right? We've made changes to our expense base over the course of this year, but we want to make sure that we're investing for long-term growth by being able to offer both technology, platforms, solutions, et cetera, so that our advisors. The most important thing about the investment is to create opportunities where the advisors have more time. More time that the advisors have, the more they're able to prospect new business and bring new assets to the top of the funnel. So that's how we're prioritizing the investments in order to get the operating leverage as the market begins to turn.\nBrennan Hawken: Well, but -- okay so do you have enough? Is that lever large enough? Are you going to be able to or willing to dial back investments in order to support moving towards that 30% pre-tax margin even without NII tailwinds?\nSharon Yeshaya: We would see ourselves in a position -- we're not -- we have put out those targets and we have been, it's not that there is a shot clock in terms of the timing of those targets spread in. The goal is to create a business model that has the opportunity to do that on a more sustained basis. And the way that one is to do that from an asset-led strategy is to grow the asset management revenue streams and the transactional streams. And that's what you're seeing over the course of this quarter alone. You're able to grow assets. You're able to deploy those assets into different transactional products, which helps the transactional line. And eventually, it also moves into the advice-based relationship product, which has a higher annuity stream as well. And so that's the strategy, and you're seeing it play out as we move forward.\nJames Gorman: I just point out, Brennan, I mean, on $6.5 billion of revenue, the deficit against the 30% long-term target is currently about $120 million, $130 million. So this is not, you know, we're talking less than 2%. We're already at 28% ex-integration cost. They could take 2% of the cost out of that business tomorrow and hit that number, so this is not you know back in the day when we were talking about 20% margin and we were at 8% that was you know when certain people were skeptical about that. We're in a whole different league now. 28% can go to 30%. We can make that happen. What we want to make sure is we make happen the growth over the next several years. So it is not a heavy lift. I'm not worried about that at all.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thank you for that. If you could, Sharon, maybe just one more clarification, because you talked about the asset side and looking at market yields. What's the duration that we should be thinking about if we're trying to calibrate? Because the disclosure on the asset side for the wealth is not as robust. We have to kind of use a couple creative metrics within the filings?\nSharon Yeshaya: In general, when you're talking about the AFS portfolio, the duration of the AFS portfolio is under 2. But what you have to think about is just the deposits themselves and what's going on with right now when we look at it. We're slightly still asset sensitive, but of course if rates rise, the deposit duration also shortens. So I just think you have to think about, you know, you're taking all things into consideration as you move forward, given the cycle.\nJames Gorman: We're going to try and get in the last three questions quickly here, so we might run five minutes over.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey good morning. Maybe just pivoting to the trading business, fixed trading, up sequentially a bit unusual in a seasonally slow third quarter. So maybe just talk a little bit about the drivers, how sustainable you think they are, at least in the near-term and maybe overall thoughts on industry wallet into next year?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, it's a great question. When you look at what's gone on in terms of the industry wallet, we talked a lot about 2019 and 2020 being bookends. Obviously, you are above the 2019 wallet more broadly, and you see this playing out, because things like fixed income, you do have more central bank action, and you do have more broadly associated vol when you think about pre-COVID levels. So all that is fundamentally positive. In terms of specifically the trading businesses, you had movements like I said in commodities, oil, that ability to capture vol, it's really around being there for our clients, but having greater velocity of sheet. And the more that we're able to do that as we move forward, we restructured this business tremendously over the course of the last eight, nine years. And it's being there to be able to serve our clients and using our resources to some degree more effectively and efficiently.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks.\nJames Gorman: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: We'll go Next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, one kind of positive question, one negative question, maybe James. When you think of the permanent improvement from 2019 levels pre-pandemic, how much higher do you think global wallet shares should be for both investment banking and trading? Like as you look out over three to five years, is this 2019 the normal or should it be above that? Because we're drifting back, global wallet share is drifting back toward 2019 and although you know the big U.S. bank is staying above that? And then the negative question is just NII is down 9% quarter-over-quarter wealth and kind of what are you guiding for that to be down and when do you think that will be in flex? Thanks.\nJames Gorman: Sure. I think the wallet -- global wallet will trend higher than 19%. I think you're at a, right now we're obviously had an extreme low on the banking side and trading is kind of muted. I mean fixed income, yes we had a sequential nice run, equities at 3.5%, these are nowhere near top levels. I don't see any of the global competitors challenging the top of the U.S. tree, the top three or four firms. So and I think what's going on, as I said earlier, with the Middle East and India, Japan, parts of LATAM , you're going to see non-U.S. growth over the next several years. So, yes, I feel actually really pretty good about the outlook. And I'll let Sharon, I think we've touched on a lot of the NII stuff. And obviously, you can't model this stuff. You don't know exactly how people behave, because it's a function of how they feel about where rates are and other opportunities at any point in time. But Sharon?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, we're not given 2024 guidance right here. What we did say is that the next quarter, we have said, will be lower. And that's a function, mathematically, of the exit rates of deposits where we entered the quarter. But what is encouraging is that as we ended September and then we looked into October, client behavior is in line with our modeled expectations.\nOperator: We'll move on to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Sharon. Good morning, James. I'll just ask a single question in view of the time. Can you guys give us a view of the outlook for your mergers and acquisitions, your appetite? Obviously, James, over your tenure you guys have done a number of successful acquisitions and as you look out over the next three to five years. I know James you won't be here, but what's the appetite? Is it still something opportunistic if something comes up? It seems like you have all your products lined up by channel, but can you get economies of scale by buying some competitors in different channels? Thank you.\nJames Gorman: Definitely the latter. It's not just opportunistic, it\u2019s strategic in that we have a game plan. We just completed an offsite about a month ago with the whole operating committee and each of the leaders that you know all about, Ted Andy and Dan, we're heavily engaged in that from the business side. I think, you know, there are lot of things -- there are a lot of interesting properties in this world and we've got a machine, Jim Hennessy, I'll give a call out to him, he led the integration of E-Trade, he actually led the integration going all the way back to Smith Barney, 100s of people that work on that. So we've got an integration machine. I mean, you start with, do you have a vision of what the company should look like? And then do you have a set of strategic options, which if available, you would hit the bid? Then the opportunistic is when they become available, like in advance, did you hit the bid? But the real issue is, can you integrate them safely and securely? And then finally, having done that, will that drive growth above the current run rate? So that's how we think about acquisitions. The team is very weighted behind it, but I don't know Sharon if you want to add anything to that, but yes this firm will do sensible, you know, not reckless, not life-changing, but sensible deals as we've done you know we've done many of them Mesa West, Solium and there'll be -- there's a lot of opportunity out there, Gerard. I think that's a wrap.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks all for joining us. As anticipated, the market environment in aggregate remained mixed continuing a pattern we've seen over the past several quarters. Notwithstanding, the net result for Morgan Stanley was regenerated $13 billion, a little over $13 billion in revenues, $2.3 billion in net income, and ROTCE of 13.5%. The concerns around a tight employment market, high commodity prices, inflationary pressures that may impact Fed policy provide additional challenges later in the quarter. But we are seeing increasing evidence of M&A and underwriting calendars that are building and while we expect momentum to continue this year, given the fourth quarter has some seasonal considerations, we expect most of the activity to materialize in 2024. Meanwhile, it's our job to control what we can control. Firstly, we successfully completed the E-Trade integration this quarter. That was a massive undertaking, and the expenses relating to that have been bleeding through the P&L for a couple of years, it involved us migrating 14 million accounts onto our platform and honestly it went incredibly well, really a seamless performance by the team. This conversion allows us to further execute on our strategy, building our revenue synergies across channels, and attracting clients to our best-in-class advice offering. Secondly, on the capital front, we bought back 1.5 billion in stock. We averaged a nearly 4% dividend yield over the quarter, and at the same time, delivered a CET1 ratio of 15.5%, which is 260 basis points over our most recent regulatory requirement. We clearly have a significant capital buffer. Also, you saw the full details of the initial Basel III endgame proposal. As you all know, this is a proposal, not the final regulation. And I'm going to repeat that, it's a proposal. There is an enormous amount of energy being spent, conversations being had across industry groups and agency board members and I've been deeply involved myself along with Sharon Yeshaya and we've been told many times that the Federal Reserve strongly welcomes comments on this proposal. Given this, I anticipate that the agencies will be open to considering thoughtful changes before it's adopted as a final rule. But let me be crystal clear, because of the buffers we have built, even if this proposal were implemented today as written, we have adequate capital to meet the ultimate requirement. Needless to say there are many years between now and then. In the quarter, wealth management generated net new assets of $36 billion, that's obviously below recent quarters. It's consistent with what I've been saying for a long time. These numbers will bounce around and in any quarterly period, they're always idiosyncratic things. This year we've had two quarters where we had some surprise on the upside and in aggregate for the year, we're totally net new assets of $235 billion year-to-date. Our annualized growth rate is at the high end of the 5% to 7% range that we've been looking at. And it's consistent, in fact, it's spot on with our three-year target of a trillion dollars for net new money. Overall, this firm is in excellent shape, notwithstanding the geopolitical and market turmoil that we find ourselves in. My hope and expectation is to hand over Morgan Stanley with as clean as slate as possible and deal with a few of our outstanding issues in the next couple of months. I'm very excited about the future of this firm, its leadership, its strategy, and its culture. And I'll now turn it over to Sharon, who can discuss the quarter in greater detail. And then together, as always, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Well, Christian, maybe I take that given Sharon just pummeled you and I want to give you a little bit of a break here. By the way, the only thing I'd add to what Sharon said is when people have a choice of making a 4%, 5% return by doing nothing, they're not going to be trading in the other market. So the actual secondary lines in the revenues of the lowest I've seen for years in the last couple of years as rates do eventually come down, they will come down, I don't think next year, but they'll come down after that. You'll see more activity in that regard and actually you'll see more money go up in the sweep. So interestingly, there's kind of an optimal point where rates are attractive for investors, but not so high they keep them out of the market and not so high that there isn't money kept on sweep. So very different from the checking account phenomenon you see at some of the commercial banks. But back to the 20%, I mean, I just say, as you know, we actually, we were at 20%. So it's not -- this is not a -- this would not be a remarkable achievement. It's a bit like when I first came to Morgan Stanley and people asked me if the wealth management business could generate, in those days 15% margins. And I said, well, there are two people already doing it, so it's pretty obvious it can be done. So we've done it and nothing structural has changed. If anything, the firm's got stronger, we've been investing a lot. I mean, this E-Trade deal was, you know, it was a lot of investment to get that integration done. We decided to keep investing through the cycle on the funnel and wealth, because we think over the next 10-years that's going to pay monster dividends. The integration across all the Eaton Vance platforms, they were never really integrated as one platform across the different, you know, Atlanta, Calvert, Parametric and Eaton Vance and now sorting through all of that, which Dan has done a great job of doing. And then frankly, banking has been really weak. I mean, under a billion dollars is evidence of a very weak calendar and very weak M&A. And the pipeline we saw this quarter was really strong. So I don't think the announcements won't translate into revenues in Q4, but they will in Q1, Q2 next year. So just on the math, I think if we're running about $2.2 billion we'd have to generate about another $700 million net a quarter. Just on the expense management, we could do things on expenses easily, more than we've done. And you could get a couple of hundred million from that. And then on the revenue side, as banking recovers, some of the transaction stuff we just talked about and Sharon pointed out, these assets moving into a pneumatized product. And then I think Fed will move up from this point. You pretty easily get to the 20%. So I appreciate the question and I'm not concerned about that long-term outlook. I think it's -- as it has happened and will happen again and frankly won't be that long. I think I don't know. On the second bit, I just think there's an optimal point. I mean, we went from zero rates to 5% in effectively the fastest period since the 60s, early 70s, fastest rate increase. What's remarkable is we haven't had a recession, by the way, but -- and I personally don't think we're going to. But with that, I mean, if you're an advisor and you've got a client sitting on a lot of cash earnings zero, I would hope you're telling them to put it in treasuries or something. So that's exactly what's happened. At around 2% to 3%, it becomes a different kind of discussion. So I think there's a trigger point and you're seeing it across, as you said, the whole industry and that's why you're seeing a different behavior set for people in checking accounts where they haven't gone to buy the money sitting in the checking account. If they're not paying attention, they're still getting, I don't know, 20 basis points or something. So as rates come down, the total cash we have in the book, which is 23%, will be coming down anyway, because it's just -- that's an abnormality related to where rates are right now. As rates come down over the next couple of years, you're actually going to see people much less price sensitive on what they're generating in a return on the cash and just using it as a liquidity account to manage investments going in and out. So I think in some ways we overachieved relative to our particular business mix. So I'm quite encouraged about the future because of that. And think, in fact, you're hearing some of that language coming out of the banks where they said, I forget what the words some of the other CEOs said, but it was effectively the same. They've overachieved in that it's sitting in checking accounts and they're making an enormous amount of money on that, but that's unsustainable. We've overachieved in that rates are so high, everybody wanted to be in cash, earning not cash sitting dormant. I don't know if that makes sense to you, Glenn. By the way I have to say I did love your comment about, you know, Paul talked about green shoots, somebody forgot to water them. I'd give you that one. Yes, about three years from now. No, wait, listen, Glenn, come on. We said I will not be CEO, I said at the annual meeting I wouldn't be CEO within a year. And I said that for a very simple reason that people didn't believe that I was going to leave because apparently bank CEOs don't. And I said I would and when I say I'm going to do something, I'm definitely going to do it. I would leave at the earliest possible moment that the board feels comfortable making that decision. And I've made that very clear to them. I think they've done a terrific job. Now that you've opened up the question, I'll answer it more broadly. They've done a terrific job. Dennis Nally and the succession comp committee and Tom Glocer, lead director on the board, all the directors engaged, really thorough process. And I don't want to give you an exact time, because that's sort of a spoiler. I already did that apparently talking about Logan Roy once. But we're -- shall I say we're well into it. And I do believe there are diminishing returns at some point in time. We're not there. The team is doing great. The businesses are moving forward. But yes, I want to get out of the seat and give somebody else a chance to see what they can do with it. And I think there's a lot of things, the growth opportunities in this company, now that we've set it up with so many planks that are solid, you have an abundance of choices. And I just, you know, just look at what we've done with MUFG in Japan, the so-called 2.0 that you know, Ted has been driving with Hero, the CEO of MUFG of taking our Japanese business with them to a completely different level and I think there's a lot of things we can do with them in Japan strategically taking advantage of the turnaround of the Japanese economy. That's just one example. So yes, we're getting close. I'm certainly not a barrier to it. I'm a -- I don't know if the word's enabler, but I'd like to get on with it, and I'll help in the transition as Executive Chairman for a bit, and this place will go forth and thrive. No, I definitely don't think there's a structural issue. I mean, my goodness, the business is generating, I'm talking about wealth 26% margins with the various costs in there, and I think it's 28% Sharon without them. If you'd told me a few years ago, I mean, I thought we'd get to 28%, but pretty much nobody else in the world did. So, no, there's no structural issue here -- there. I'm just saying as a -- and I do think if, at the risk of making prediction, I suspect the Fed will do one more rate increase at some, you know, by the end of the year, I guess November. But that's likely to be it. And I do not expect the Fed to cut rates in 2024, but I do expect going forward after that. So given that, we're talking about 12-months. The cash is largely moved. It's moved, you know, on the margin you're going to have a little bit of NII impact over the next 12-months, but that's really not the real game. The real game is go forward after that. So, and the minute you see the Fed indicate they've stopped raising rates, the M&A and underwriting calendar will explode, because there is enormous pent-up activity. But Boards of directors are sitting there and saying, until we understand the cost of financing, it is very difficult to pull the trigger on some of these capital transactions. So I think you're heading into, and unfortunately I'm not going to be around to enjoy it, but you're heading into a really good patch here. And I don't know if it's six months out or nine months out or it starts three months out, but this thing is going to start turning and then rates will be the kick when they start coming down. And as I said people will be less focused on cash and accounts and more focused on investment opportunities, that's when you're going to see the double kicker. I hope so. And I just said, I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, we're opening an office in Abu Dhabi. If you think of the combination Middle East, India, Japan, kind of, offsetting what's going on in China. And then strategically, I would be very surprised if this firm doesn't do some transactions in both wealth and asset management over the next three years outside the U.S. I think we have a game plan for it. Strategically, the team has worked on a lot of ideas. And obviously, we want to make sure when we do it, we're, you know, we're fully ready and we understand all of the, you know, the diligence issues around some of these relationships and careful about that, but I think the opportunities are clearly there. Good morning. I'll just say one thing on the war for talent. Yes, I mean, obviously, really high performers are in demand across the street. But we've actually had the opposite issue. We've had very low attrition, which is why we did some of the expense initiatives that Sharon talked about. And I guess we should feel flattered. It's a reflection of the culture and the stability of the firm. But also, that's why we took the initiatives, because you've got to bring in talented people and new generations to keep growing this place. So one's these and two's these, yes, you can lose somebody, a senior person here or there and we've hired a bunch in banking insurance, but the broader across the 80,000 people we've got is the broader messages attrition has been remarkably low and that's something that, you know, we just got to work through. I'm going to have to write this down. There's an old guy, there's a lot to remember. It's not going to affect ROTCE. We're not going to be increasing capital. So that one you can put to bed. The cushion, you know, it's a function where the rules come out. I mean, I've been very clear about this day one. I do not believe the proposal as is will be what we see when the comment period is over. I do not believe that. I have no special insight except that obviously I spent a lot of time with the regulatory community, which I've done for 14-years. I think everybody understands for example the way operating risk RWAs have been calculated in a sort of blunt instrument based on fees is not, you know, it wasn't what Basel was originally going to do though. We're going to take that rule out years ago. And they ended up just not getting around to it. And suddenly we're complying with something that they didn't even want and don't, you know, they don't use in Europe. So it's not that -- it's just not going to happen the way it is. And that's not being pollyannaish. That's just, that's my judgment call. That said, what we want to frame with investors is, god forbid, it does happen exactly as is. The rule becomes proposal rule tomorrow, then we're fine. So we're certainly not going to be raising capital. We're going to continue with our buyback through this period. The final implementation of this thing is going to be 2028. You know, there's a lot that's going to happen between now and then. But listen, this is the first time you've had members of the Fed Board and the FDIC, I think, come out in advance of a rule being promulgated, if that's the word, saying that they're not comfortable with it. So there's clearly debate within the regulatory institutions. And if you get past the -- why we need more capital, which I don't think the industry does, into well what should it be, the only place it clearly shouldn't be is punishing businesses that have fees attached to them, whether it's credit cards or wealth management, that's not the regulatory intent. And they've told me that and therefore I believe that will change. So on the cushion it's frankly a function of, you know, where the rule ends up. We'll carry whatever appropriate prudent cushion we need to carry. On do we create more capital? No, not unless we grow the business to reflect that, that we can put it to work. And thirdly, will we continue buybacks? Yes, and I'm sure Sharon can give more play from what we think about on the buyback side and dividends for that matter. I just point out, Brennan, I mean, on $6.5 billion of revenue, the deficit against the 30% long-term target is currently about $120 million, $130 million. So this is not, you know, we're talking less than 2%. We're already at 28% ex-integration cost. They could take 2% of the cost out of that business tomorrow and hit that number, so this is not you know back in the day when we were talking about 20% margin and we were at 8% that was you know when certain people were skeptical about that. We're in a whole different league now. 28% can go to 30%. We can make that happen. What we want to make sure is we make happen the growth over the next several years. So it is not a heavy lift. I'm not worried about that at all. We're going to try and get in the last three questions quickly here, so we might run five minutes over. Thanks, Jim. Sure. I think the wallet -- global wallet will trend higher than 19%. I think you're at a, right now we're obviously had an extreme low on the banking side and trading is kind of muted. I mean fixed income, yes we had a sequential nice run, equities at 3.5%, these are nowhere near top levels. I don't see any of the global competitors challenging the top of the U.S. tree, the top three or four firms. So and I think what's going on, as I said earlier, with the Middle East and India, Japan, parts of LATAM , you're going to see non-U.S. growth over the next several years. So, yes, I feel actually really pretty good about the outlook. And I'll let Sharon, I think we've touched on a lot of the NII stuff. And obviously, you can't model this stuff. You don't know exactly how people behave, because it's a function of how they feel about where rates are and other opportunities at any point in time. But Sharon? Definitely the latter. It's not just opportunistic, it's strategic in that we have a game plan. We just completed an offsite about a month ago with the whole operating committee and each of the leaders that you know all about, Ted Andy and Dan, we're heavily engaged in that from the business side. I think, you know, there are lot of things -- there are a lot of interesting properties in this world and we've got a machine, Jim Hennessy, I'll give a call out to him, he led the integration of E-Trade, he actually led the integration going all the way back to Smith Barney, 100s of people that work on that. So we've got an integration machine. I mean, you start with, do you have a vision of what the company should look like? And then do you have a set of strategic options, which if available, you would hit the bid? Then the opportunistic is when they become available, like in advance, did you hit the bid? But the real issue is, can you integrate them safely and securely? And then finally, having done that, will that drive growth above the current run rate? So that's how we think about acquisitions. The team is very weighted behind it, but I don't know Sharon if you want to add anything to that, but yes this firm will do sensible, you know, not reckless, not life-changing, but sensible deals as we've done you know we've done many of them Mesa West, Solium and there'll be -- there's a lot of opportunity out there, Gerard. I think that's a wrap."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.3 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.38 and our ROTCE was 13.5%. Results in the third quarter were solid against a mixed market backdrop. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. Together, severance and DCP impacted the year-to-date efficiency ratio by nearly 150 basis points. As we invest for growth, our integration efforts have remained a priority. Integration-related expenses were $68 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate a similar amount in the fourth quarter as previously communicated. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues were $5.7 billion, declining 3% versus the prior year. Equity and fixed income results were in line with long-term historical averages. Investment banking revenues remained depressed on lower volume. However, leading indicators across advisory and underwriting progress positively, evidenced by a notable increase of Morgan Stanley's announced volumes in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues decreased to $938 million. The change to the previous year was driven by lower results in advisory and debt underwriting. Advisory revenues of $449 million reflected a decline in completed transactions, due to lower announced volumes in prior periods. Despite the weaker quarterly results, we continue to see broad sector diversification of our completed deals and the backlog reflects a similar pattern. Equity underwriting revenues were $237 million. Overall activity remained muted relative to historical averages. While increased confidence supported early September issuances, a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve, and resulting moves in interest rates serve as a reminder that this market remains window-driven. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $252 million down versus the prior year, primarily reflecting lower non-investment grade events. We are encouraged by the growing client dialogue and bake-off activity across sectors and geographies. The pickup in our announced M&A volumes in the third quarter speak to the trends we've observed at the end of the last quarter. But the landscape continues to evolve. As we look ahead, corporate confidence will largely be determined by the overall health of the consumer and the stability of input costs. While risks remain, including geopolitical threats, the underlying trends suggest activity is building and there is a desire among clients to pursue their long-term strategic objectives. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion. The business performed in line with historical averages with relative strength in Europe and Asia. Prime brokerage revenues were solid. Client balances were modestly higher, compared to last year. The results reflect narrower spreads and the geographic mix of those balances. Cash revenues declined versus the prior year on lower overall global volumes. Derivative results increased year-over-year, reflecting higher client activity with particular strength in Europe. Fixed income revenues were $1.9 billion. Micro results increased versus the prior year, supported by strength in securitized products, both in agency and non-agency trading. Macro revenues decreased versus last year's elevated results with lower revenues and rates in foreign exchange. Results reflect lower client conviction, particularly around the future of central bank policy. Commodity revenues increase year-over-year on the back of a constructive trading environment, particularly for oil. Other revenues of $277 million improved versus last year, driven by lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, net of loan hedges, and higher net interest income and fees. Turning to ISG lending and provision. The allowance for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments increased slightly to $1.4 billion. In the quarter ISG provisions were $93 million. The increase was driven by a continued negative outlook for the commercial real estate sector. Net charge-offs were $39 million, primarily related to one commercial real estate loan in the office sector. Turning to wealth management, revenues of $6.4 billion were strong, an increase from the prior year. The growth of asset management revenues more than offset the cyclical declines in net interest income, underscoring their durability. As designed, our asset led strategy provides steady fee-based flows that support asset management revenues. With this in mind, we remain focused on asset migration into our advisor led channel. This quarter, our long-term strategy took a critical step forward as we completed the last major milestone of our E-Trade integration, successfully converting nearly $900 billion of client AUM onto the Morgan Stanley platform. This will continue to enhance our ability to introduce clients and advisors and seamlessly transition them into advice-based relationships. Moving on to the business metrics in the third quarter, pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.7%. Integration expenses, as well as DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 150 basis points. Net new assets were $36 billion, bringing year-to-date NNA to $235 billion, which represents over 7% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by new clients and positive net recruiting into the advisor led channel. The multi-year buildup of assets provide a foundational pipeline into our advisor led channel, evidence by fee-based flows of $22.5 billion in the third quarter alone. Asset management revenues of $3.6 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Higher average assets and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows over the past year drove the increase. Transactional revenues excluding DCP were $820 million, up 7% year-over-year. Results reflect opportunistic deployment of new capital by retail clients into alternatives, particularly into private equity and private credit. Bank lending balances roughly flat versus the prior quarter. Growth in mortgages and tailored lending offset paydowns and securities-based lending. Total deposits of $340 billion remain stable, compared to the prior quarter. Still, the deposit mix has shifted as clients continue to allocate rate-sensitive cash to higher-yielding cash alternatives available on the platform, including our expanded savings offering. In addition, the quarter saw consistent positive monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances, ongoing evidence of the improvement of the retail client sentiment. Net interest income was $2 billion. The sequential decline reflects a continued shift in the deposit mix. Looking towards the rest of this year, based on where we exited the quarter, we expect NII to trend lower. The magnitude will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of rates. The wealth management business model is focused on steady asset aggregation, delivering strong solutions and advice to clients, while growing durable fees and expanding margin through the cycle. We are continuing to invest in our industry-leading position and the sustainability of our long-term growth. As the backdrop recovers, advisors remain well-positioned to capture greater asset opportunity supported by our multi-channel model that was built to attract new client relationships. Turning to investment management, revenues of $1.3 billion increased 14%, compared to the prior year, supported by higher asset management revenues. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven predominantly by headwinds to our [Technical Difficulty] active equity growth strategies, which continue to see redemption consistent with the industry. Including the segment's outflows, year-to-date long-term flows across the franchise were slightly positive. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies, a partial offset to the headwinds of the quarter. Liquidity and overlay services had net flows of $5.7 billion, driven by demand for parametric institutional portfolio overlay solutions and our liquidity strategies. Specific to parametric and across the entire franchise, overlay and long-term net flows in the quarter were almost $7 billion, underscoring strong trends in this business. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year on higher average AUM. Performance-based income and other revenues were $24 million, supported by the diversification of our balance sheet light platform. Results were driven by gains in U.S. private equity, offset by weakness in Asia private equity and real estate. Our strategic focus on secular growth areas and the expansion of our global footprint remains in place. Ongoing investments in our businesses, including our market-leading parametric franchise, as well as our continued growth and innovation in private markets, position us well to best serve our clients. Turning to the balance sheet, our CET-1 ratio stands at 15.5%, roughly flat versus last quarter. Standardized RWA has declined sequentially to $445 billion, reflecting our ongoing prudent resource management and market movements at the end of the quarter. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1.5 billion of common stock during the quarter. Taken in the context of the mixed environment, we are pleased with the firm's resiliency and our competitive positioning. As clients gain more conviction, we expect our institutional business to capture more opportunities, particularly in investment banking. This increased client conviction will also further support asset growth and wealth and investment management. We will continue to press our advantages and execute on our growth strategies all while currently managing our capital profile. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Sure, actually I think that interestingly enough Christian I'm pretty impressed with the resiliency that we've seen in the business. This is literally the explanation of the funnel that we've talked about. If you look back over the course of the last year alone $260 billion or $235 billion of assets that we've captured. Then look at the fee-based flows, right? We continue to see increased fee-based flows. This past year, if you exclude the asset acquisitions that we had over the last couple of years, we are basically at some of the historical highs of seeing fee-based growth as we move forward. You're looking at times since COVID, where we obviously had very high retail engagement, and you've been able to offset, even with a decline in NII, offset those growths to asset-based, asset management revenues as you move forward. It's that, that we are trying to grow. We're trying to continue to grow our asset management fees over time and make sure that we have the right solutions in place to offer our clients. Now let's take that forward. We have this mixed environment. You have 23% of our retail client assets sitting in cash, that is 5% higher, right, from the 18% on historical averages. We've begun to see retail investors put their cash into markets. The last four months -- in consecutively, we've seen that movement into the market. This quarter alone, we began to see alternative growth in the new products, the growth in transactional revenues. We haven't seen that since the first quarter of 2022 before you started this rate hike cycle. So in my mind, actually the strategy is working pretty darn well, especially if you think about how we've been able to aggregate assets, migrate them into fee-based flows, look at transactional and see that growth -- and see growth in these new products and deliver them to our clients, all while these clients have dry powder to invest as these markets turn. So let's take the first question, which is the two different types of deposit mix. You're right, you know, from a -- if you think about the self-directed client versus a advisory-based client that we've had in the historical wealth management franchise, one has proven to be somewhat of a stickier deposit base than you would see on the wealth management side. And I think that, you know, on the -- what I would say is the traditional wealth management side that we had historically had. So that does provide you with a sense of what's going on in terms of which client base is seeing that. On the potential growth of NII going forward, again, that's part of the same asset gathering strategy. Some proportion of these assets as they come over, be that into the self-directed or the advice-based relationship, will be held in some sort of transactional cash. So that will be supportive over time of NII to some degree from a deposit perspective. But that also provides us with lending capabilities and opportunities. As you know, Glenn, we've seen tremendous, what we would call, sort of, household penetration in being able to offer new lending products to our various client bases, obviously with the SBL product. But we continue to see mortgages and growth in mortgages even in this right environment for new purchases and homes. As we better understand our client base, we're able to do that more. And actually bringing together this E-Trade acquisition, putting everything on the same portfolio and the same franchise from a technology perspective is foundational and being able to integrate all of those bank relationships and what we used to call the bank rails that E-Trade had for a broader wealth offering that should also help support NII as we look into the future. Investing more broadly internationally, James mentioned the deals or what we've been working on, I should say, MUFG 2.0 between research and also our sales and trading side. We continue to look for opportunities. We have Arun Kohli, who's been working on our India franchise. I think that there are clearly opportunities there. Within India, we see a lot of opportunities throughout Asia. We've discussed different opportunities also all across the international franchise in Europe. So when you look at, think about investment management. That was one of the key points that we had talked about potential distribution of investment management Eaton Vance products all over Europe. We've seen that. We continue to see products with Calvert, with various active ETFs that we're seeing all across Europe again. And we've been raising new AUM there. So there are ways to distribute product across different geographies. There's a way to work with our strategic partners in places like Japan. There are ways to organically take advantage and move forward in places of growth that have more secular growth trends such as India. So there are tremendous opportunities where we see that we can take, like I said, product-client relationship and also work across institutional securities and various places in investment management. Dan Simkowitz has talked a lot about that of raising funds through those partnerships and being able to look for ways to work together to also source talent internationally as we work across the organization. Yes, we've talked -- thanks Dan for the question. We have talked about the fact that within the workplace channel, I think both in the first and second quarter, I've been asked about it. And it is people are using some of that cash. We aren't necessarily seeing that movement directly into people's accounts and they're seeing actual, you know, taking the stock that they might get and actually selling it rather than investing on it, given what's going on with the economic environment, potentially inflation, et cetera. So that's, you know, potentially a theme out there. But obviously, that's dependent on the market. What is more exciting in my mind is actually where we did see the increase in NNA, which was on new clients and recruiting. So those were the two strongest components. And the ability to attract new clients, I've said it before on these calls, if you asked me five years ago, well before we bought E-Trade and when we were just looking at the beginning of the modern wealth platform, many people ask how will you ever grow, because we weren't seeing new clients coming into the institution. The investments that we've made across the technology for wealth management has been what's been able to attract new recruits. So if you talk to recruits about why they come to Morgan Stanley, it's the projects they can offer, it's the technology that we have, it's the ability to work with the clients. So you're seeing that continue and then you're also seeing new client acquisition through the funnel. So those are all positive metrics. And again, you see that in the stock plan participants rising as well. Yes, the backlog itself, we've continued to rise and to build. Overall, over the course of the year, we've talked a lot about sort of being at some of the highest levels that we've seen across all of the underwriting or on the advisory side. So all of that is optimistic. Financial sponsors, we have talked about dry powder, continue to see that. Obviously, there was some valuation gaps and as James said, the more clarity that we see around the stabilization of rates, the easier that will be around deployment. And then some key themes that we have witnessed when we look at the backlog or we think about the transactions that are happening. One is the financial sector consolidation, that's a theme that's emerging within our pipeline and our discussions in the boardroom. The second is the energy transitions. That, again, that is important to some of the transactions that we have worked on and that we've talked through. And in addition to that, we are seeing emerging themes around technology, around AI, around how companies want to use that when they're thinking about strategic focus and objectives. And all of these themes are part and parcel to the fact that you can see there's -- it's a diversified backlog. And we're investing in the franchise. We've made some key hires to help us navigate through this more complex landscape and places where we see opportunities to execute as we move forward. Good morning. So, when you think about the expenses, we have been looking at expenses through the cycle. We've unfortunately, you know, we have taken actions. We took actions both at the end of last year and then we took one in the spring as well. We've discussed those severance costs throughout the course of the year. And so we've been managing our expense base to better understand and to sort of think about it against the backdrop of what environment are we seeing. So while there is -- there is always a war for talent. We do pay for talent and we pay competitively for that talent, but we have to think about it in the context of where we see the potential growth opportunities. And that is also, we have to take into account the investments that we're making. And that's around processes and investing in technology. And when you look at the technology that we're investing in, we should see operating efficiencies and leverage as you go forward. So that's modernization of the plant. You're going to have optimization, and you're also going to work on things like making sure that you have the right risk and control framework to give ourselves an opportunity to grow. So just what it means to boil it down is it's a balance, right, of investing for the future, but also making sure that you have the right expense base, rather, as you move forward and you can take advantage and see those efficiency gains. And really the operating leverage that James is talking about as we move forward through the cycle. Yes, on the capital return strategy, we've been really clear that we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Dan said that at the September conference, even when you think about all Basel, we first and foremost, we've talked about the dividend strategy. We doubled our dividend a few years ago and we've continually increased the dividend. That increase has been reflective of the growth and stable revenues that we've had more broadly as an institution. Then, of course, buyback, we're committed to a buyback, but the size of a buyback is always going to be opportunistic when you think about what the alternatives are for capital usage, right? So what are the opportunities that we see going forward and will make the right decision for what we think the right decision is for the company and for our shareholders around the uses of the capital. But we increased the buyback this quarter. So that shows you sort of how we feel about being able to return capital to our shareholders when you compare this quarter over the course of last quarter, moving from $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars. Look, we haven't really -- this deal was never contemplated from a cost synergy perspective. It's really been around revenue synergies. Will there be potential savings on the margin? It's possible. But that's not really the point of the transaction. What I think is more fundamentally interesting is that a couple of things when you think about the E-Trade integration, other than the fact that it went very smoothly as it relates to the clients themselves, it creates a really clear foundation when we're trying to migrate clients from channels and move them. So give somebody from an E-Trade channel or a self-directed channel and say, let's make an introduction to an FA and begin that potential migration. If you're on the same platform, it's a much easier and much more seamless transition. So that's a positive use of that. That's an example of how being on the same platform is helpful. The same goes for workplace, right? Everything flows into the same places. Again, that should be helpful as we move forward. It's also very helpful from a bank rails perspective. So as we think about banking products, as you can use, remember E-Trade had bank rails on their platform. Again, a lot of that can be used as we are now looking to potentially grow portions of the bank or grow lending or grow deposits. Those are all things that now that the platforms are put together on a consolidated basis. So I would look at it more from a revenue synergy perspective than necessarily a cost synergy perspective. Yes, again, so when I look -- I would look at the movement sweeps, if you're trying to draw a relationship between sweeps and NII really over the last two quarters, the asset yields are going to be a function of what the market yields are. Last quarter, for example, I mentioned that we had the NII was supported by higher asset yields. You'll remember that when we walked out of the first quarter, we were in a position where there was still a regional banking crisis. Some of the yields were higher, as you think about funding yields, simply because of what was going on in the environment. As those yields normalized, that came down, you lost some of that asset yield, and you began to see what we, you know, a different kind of, the deposits themselves had a bigger, more prominent reaction when you look at a sequential change in NII. So what I would try and do is you should take both quarters, for example, into consideration when you're thinking about the relationship between sweeps in NII. And of course, asset yields will be determined by market factors more broadly. Thanks for the question, Brennan. As you would expect, it's a balance, right? We've made changes to our expense base over the course of this year, but we want to make sure that we're investing for long-term growth by being able to offer both technology, platforms, solutions, et cetera, so that our advisors. The most important thing about the investment is to create opportunities where the advisors have more time. More time that the advisors have, the more they're able to prospect new business and bring new assets to the top of the funnel. So that's how we're prioritizing the investments in order to get the operating leverage as the market begins to turn. We would see ourselves in a position -- we're not -- we have put out those targets and we have been, it's not that there is a shot clock in terms of the timing of those targets spread in. The goal is to create a business model that has the opportunity to do that on a more sustained basis. And the way that one is to do that from an asset-led strategy is to grow the asset management revenue streams and the transactional streams. And that's what you're seeing over the course of this quarter alone. You're able to grow assets. You're able to deploy those assets into different transactional products, which helps the transactional line. And eventually, it also moves into the advice-based relationship product, which has a higher annuity stream as well. And so that's the strategy, and you're seeing it play out as we move forward. In general, when you're talking about the AFS portfolio, the duration of the AFS portfolio is under 2. But what you have to think about is just the deposits themselves and what's going on with right now when we look at it. We're slightly still asset sensitive, but of course if rates rise, the deposit duration also shortens. So I just think you have to think about, you know, you're taking all things into consideration as you move forward, given the cycle. Yes, it's a great question. When you look at what's gone on in terms of the industry wallet, we talked a lot about 2019 and 2020 being bookends. Obviously, you are above the 2019 wallet more broadly, and you see this playing out, because things like fixed income, you do have more central bank action, and you do have more broadly associated vol when you think about pre-COVID levels. So all that is fundamentally positive. In terms of specifically the trading businesses, you had movements like I said in commodities, oil, that ability to capture vol, it's really around being there for our clients, but having greater velocity of sheet. And the more that we're able to do that as we move forward, we restructured this business tremendously over the course of the last eight, nine years. And it's being there to be able to serve our clients and using our resources to some degree more effectively and efficiently. Yes, we're not given 2024 guidance right here. What we did say is that the next quarter, we have said, will be lower. And that's a function, mathematically, of the exit rates of deposits where we entered the quarter. But what is encouraging is that as we ended September and then we looked into October, client behavior is in line with our modeled expectations."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the second quarter with significant headwinds and uncertainties, and it's fair to say that we ended the quarter overall in a better place with a better tone. The headwinds reflect the ongoing market transition from a high-inflation, low-rate environment to a higher-rate, lower-inflation environment. In addition, there were several other issues impacting the markets. April started on the heels of the first bank crisis since 2008, which had the risk of bleeding into the broader financial system. Prompt action by regulators and what turned out to be idiosyncratic stories of the failed banks combined with the strength and support from the large U.S. banks helped to rebalance the system. Second, we found our country moving headlong into a debt ceiling crisis. While our view was it was likely to be resolved, there is no doubt it created unnecessary uncertainty in the markets in April and May. Thirdly, after rapidly raising rates over 15 months, the Fed reached a pause, if not a plateau at its recent meeting. And while we may not be quite at the end of rate increases, I believe we're very, very close to it. Finally, strong rhetoric from government leaders from both the U.S. and China in recent weeks is evident, but there's now been recent efforts to normalize relations and a constructive dialogue is surely welcome. Seeing these four not-insignificant macro concerns progressed positively, supported a more constructive tone in the markets, particularly evidenced in the last few weeks of the quarter. Beyond more macro issues, we at Morgan Stanley completed a significant part of the E*TRADE back-office integration with the final part to be completed after Labor Day and we're very pleased with how it's gone. And today, we announced new institutional initiatives with Japanese research and equity and in foreign exchange with our long standing partner, MUFG, further evidence of how our businesses can work together over time to best serve our global clients. And importantly, we received the most recent results of CCAR. We're pleased our performance under the stress test has improved for the fourth consecutive year, every year since the SCB was introduced. Given our strong results, we increased our dividend by $0.075, the same as we did last year. That brings our total annual dividend per share to $3.40 annually with a dividend yield of about 4% given the current stock price. As to the financial performance of the firm this quarter, certain key metrics were encouraging. Net new assets in Wealth Management grew by $90 billion, and combined with inflows from Investment Management, we saw over $100 billion, bringing our year-to-date net new assets to approximately $200 billion in six months. Our year-to-date growth is well ahead of pace, and while obviously any quarter can bounce around and that will happen, our consistent growth in net new assets in Wealth Management is evidence of our scale and our expanded channels and the clients that we serve. Second, our institutional businesses navigated a choppy environment well. And altogether, the firm delivered net revenues of over $13 billion, up 2% from last year when conditions were very different. This translates into an ROTCE of 12%. Finally, our CET1 ratio was 15.5%. While we knew this would significantly exceed our capital requirements, and it did, it reflects our desire to remain highly capitalized in the face of the new unfolding Basel III Endgame. It's too early to predict the rate of market improvement through the rest of 2023, but the more positive tone and activity seen later in the quarter across many parts of our business is promising. Of course, how much it moves through the balance of the year remains unknown. That said, the fundamentals of our business model remain strong. Finally, a brief comment on succession. At the annual meeting in May, I made it clear I would transition out of the CEO role before next year's annual meeting. Succession planning should be intentional and managed just like strategic planning for the firm or any of our critical talent management processes. We are and have been dealing with a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the CCAR results, business environment, Basel III upcoming Endgame proposals and certain other pending matters. I committed to the Board that I lead our response to those issues, and when I do transition out of the CEO role, I remain as Executive Chairman for a period of time. We are fortunate indeed to have three very strong internal candidates that the Board continues to evaluate along appropriate processes for their readiness to step up as the next CEO of Morgan Stanley. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.5 billion. Our EPS was $1.24, and our ROTCE was 12.1%. Reported results include severance charges of approximately $300 million. This reduced EPS by $0.14 and ROTCE by about 140 basis points. As James discussed, sentiment and activity improved towards the end of the quarter, evidenced by green shoots that emerged across our businesses. In Institutional Securities, client engagement progressively picked up. And in Wealth Management, we witnessed a moderation of sweep outflows as well as the stabilization of retail investments into cash and cash equivalents. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. In addition to severance, expenses for the quarter included $99 million of costs associated with the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, approximately 75% of which relates to E*TRADE. Together, severance and this year's integration represent an impact of about 175 basis points to the year-to-date efficiency ratio. For the balance of the year, our expectations for total integration expenses are broadly in line with our prior guidance, with approximately $150 million remaining. Looking towards the back half of 2023, we continue to balance investments with the operating environment. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $5.7 billion declined 8% versus last year. With overall client activity -- while overall client activity was lower compared to the prior period, results improved as the quarter progressed, alongside better market conditions. Investment banking revenues were flat compared to a year ago. Although advisory remained under pressure, a pickup in underwriting supported results. Advisory revenues of $455 million reflected lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $225 million. While IPO activity remained muted, results were supported by follow-on and convertibles, encouraging signs that equity and equity-linked markets were opened at times for regular weight issuance. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $395 million, up year-over-year, driven mostly by investment-grade bond issuance, where corporates and financials took advantage of constructive markets in May and June, respectively. Investment-grade markets remain resilient against an uncertain backdrop. Across investment banking, client activity trended positively as the quarter progressed. The preannounced M&A backlog grew consistently throughout the quarter with a potential plateau in rates and lower implied volatility, client dialogue is currently active. We continue to invest in the franchise and have made selective senior hires to enhance our footprint to best position for the opportunity. While we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown and it is hard to know whether positive trends will continue for the near term, current conditions remain encouraging, certainly for the medium-term outlook and especially for 2024. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, down 14% compared to strong results in the previous second quarter due to lower activity and lower market volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were solid, supported by increasing average client balances, consistent with rising market levels. Cash and derivatives declined versus last year on lower global volumes and lower market volatility. Fixed income revenues of $1.7 billion decreased compared to last year's elevated results. Solid performance reflects tempered client activity and prudent risk management. However, improved market conditions in June shifted client sentiment and supported the quarter's overall results. Macro revenues were down year-over-year, attributed to the declines in foreign exchange and a challenging environment and reduced activity, partially offset by the pickup in client engagement following the resolution of the debt ceiling debate and performance in rates. Micro results declined versus last year, predominantly on the back of lower client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly compared to the robust prior year, which benefited from volatile energy markets. Other revenues of $315 million improved versus last year, largely driven by lower mark-to-market losses net of hedges and higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans held for sale. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. Our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $97 million. The increase was driven by continued negative outlook for commercial real estate and modest portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $30 million, and were substantially all from a handful of specific loans from our corporate lending portfolio. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $6.7 billion, a record. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were $6.6 billion and increased 5%, supported by higher net interest income. Results demonstrate the strength of the business model and our ability to continue to serve clients throughout different market environments. Pretax profit was $1.7 billion, with a PBT margin of 25.2%. Severance charges were $78 million and integration-related expenses were $75 million. Taken together and with the impact of DCP, these three factors were a drag in the margin of approximately 300 basis points. Despite the challenging market backdrop, the business model continued to deliver against our core objectives. Most notably, Wealth Management delivered $90 billion of net new assets, demonstrating our platform's ability to grow in various market environments. Net new assets were driven by our advisor-led channel, existing client consolidation and net recruiting were strong and offset seasonal tax-related outflows in April. Our early investments in technology, including data and AI, are providing advisers with tools to service current clients better and more efficiently prospect new business, including from our workplace channel. Also significant, as James mentioned, we are pleased to share that we've accomplished an integral part of E*TRADE's back-office integration, converting over 3 million E*TRADE accounts to Morgan Stanley's unified platform. We did this with virtually no client disruption, which has always been a critical priority. We expect to finish our integration efforts on time in the second half of this year. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Performance was solid down the line in light of the environment. Asset management revenues were $3.5 billion, down 2% versus last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $869 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 2% year-over-year, reflective of lower client activity for most of the quarter. Fee-based flows were $22.7 billion. Bank lending balances grew by $1.1 billion, driven by mortgages, offsetting paydowns in securities-based lending. Total deposits of $343 billion were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Sweep outflows moderated during May and June compared to April, which included seasonal tax outflows. The recent month's trends are encouraging, but it remains too early to be declarative. Net interest income of $2.2 billion was virtually flat versus the prior quarter. The impact of lower sweep balances and higher funding costs were offset by higher rates. Looking towards the rest of the year, we do not expect NII to expand. Results will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of various rates. Similar to the institutional business, retail sentiment improved as the quarter progressed. For the first time since the beginning of the year, June saw positive monthly flows into equity markets from advisor-led sweep balances. We are encouraged by this more recent activity and remain well positioned to support ongoing asset growth and our clients through market cycles. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion declined 9% from the prior second quarter, primarily reflecting lower performance-based income and the cumulative impact of lower asset levels over the course of the year, commensurate with the market environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, declining 3% year-over-year, reflecting the stability and diversification of our client franchise. Performance-based income and other revenues declined year-over-year due to the challenging investing environment in certain asset classes and markets, such as real estate and Asia private equity. Solid performance in other areas of our private alternative strategies acted as a partial offset, reflecting the diversity of our platform and our capital-light, client-driven alternative franchise. Total AUM increased $1.4 trillion. Our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter. Long-term net flows were positive. Inflows were driven by ongoing demand in alternatives and solutions, which offset outflows in equities and fixed income. Within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios, private credit and private equity continue -- excuse me, remain consistent sources of net inflows, underscoring the benefits of our diverse platform. Additionally, this quarter, alternatives and solutions benefited from a significant inflow related to a portfolio solutions mandate. Liquidity and overlay services had an inflows of $9.7 billion, supported by ongoing demand for money market funds. We continue to be very well positioned in secular growth areas, such as customization in private markets, across geographies and with our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $35 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.5%, up approximately 40 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs declined about $9 billion from the prior quarter to $450 billion due to market conditions and continued prudent resource management. Recent stress test results reaffirmed our strong capital position and our durable business model. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075 and renewed our $20 billion multi-year repurchase authorization. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting our global mix of earnings. While we outperformed our tax guidance in the first half, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23% in the second half of this year, consistent with our initial guidance. Although we cannot be sure how the backdrop will play out for the rest of 2023, our priority of the management team is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. Should stable and higher asset levels prevail, Wealth and Investment Management are poised to benefit, particularly as we continue to attract net new assets, a testament to our asset growth strategy. Within Institutional Securities, while advisory will lag the financing market, the backlog is building and underwriting trends are positive. Open and functioning markets remain key to supporting client conviction and activity levels. Most critically, our business continues to advance our clear and consistent firm strategy, driving long-term growth while remaining well capitalized. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you, and good morning.\nJames Gorman: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe first question, James, for you. Thanks for the update on the succession. As we think about what you built in terms of the franchise, and I think you talked about the unfolding Basel Endgame rules that are expected over the next week or two, from a shareholder perspective, do you see these rules as game-changing where investors will have to reevaluate the value proposition of Morgan Stanley as a franchise? And you, as a management team, would have to review strategic targets that you've laid out? Give us a sense. And I know plenty of unknowns. But I think the question we get from shareholders is the comfort around the ability of the firm to manage through what could be pretty radical changes.\nJames Gorman: Well, it's an important question. And you're right, I have made comments on it. Let's sort of set the table of where we are right now. We've had a lot of speculation based off of what the Basel III Endgame looks like. By the way, I'm not sure it's actually being implemented fully in Europe, just to say. I think the U.S. banks actually have more capital, but putting that knit aside, we did get the speech from the Vice Chair. I think it's important to look at the title of that speech, which was holistic capital review. So, it's taking into account all of the CCAR, stress tests, SCB buffers and the like as this stuff is implemented. Secondly, we haven't seen the actual rules. I mean, I guess there will be a proposal coming out, as you said, in a couple of weeks. There will be an extensive comment period. There is clearly very different views as to the need for the U.S. banking system to accrete more capital. In fact, if you look at the test of the last few years, what happened with the regional banks, what -- Silicon Valley First Republic Signature, what happened during COVID, what's happened during this period of high inflation, what's happened with the biggest rate increase we've had in 40 years, put all that together, the U.S. large banks actually did really well. In fact, if not all of them, certainly for Morgan Stanley, our capital position improved four years in a row under CCAR. So, it's kind of hard for me to sit here and say that we won't be commenting forcefully that we are very well capitalized. But there will be an extensive comment period. I suspect what comes out of that will not be the same as what starts. I think in the sausage making, there will be a lot of evaluation. Clearly, the intent is not to harm the U.S. banking system, which is the backbone of the economy. It's to strengthen us. Then there will be a long transition period. So, I just happen to be reading the speech from the Vice Chair in the last couple of days, and he had a paragraph in there anticipating this question. I thought I'd read to any proposed changes would go through the standard notice and comment rule-making process, allowing for all interested parties appropriate time. Any final changes to capital requirements would occur with appropriate transition times. And he goes on again later in his speech to point out, it could be -- it will not be fully effective for some years. So, here we are in 2023. I don't think this is going to happen in any meaningful way before the end of 2026. I think what comes out a year from now after comment period will be very different from what goes in. And just take my personal peep in it, which is applying a standardized RWA hit on operating risk as the various regulators trying to figure out what the right way to assess operating risk capital is. And to put a standardized hit is fine, but to do it based on fee income, which is the current European proposal, seems to me to be nuts. I mean, we're not -- you don't build fee-based businesses to create operating risk. You build them to create stability. So that's a point we've made very clear with the regulators, and I think they're taking it under consideration. So, long story short, yes, it's the final trust. It's ironic, I don't believe all the European banks are complying with their own rules. We have a very healthy robust capital system here that's been tested 12 years in a row. Morgan Stanley has done well. And there is no chance there will be a major strategic shift for Morgan Stanley as a result of any of this, is my conclusion.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That is helpful, and nuts sounds about right. One quick question, Sharon, for you. You mentioned NII not seen as expanding from here. I guess, is implied in the expectation that NII should stabilize in the back half, give or take, within a few percentage points?\nSharon Yeshaya: It will depend really -- Ebrahim, thanks for the question. It really depends on the deposit mix. And so, as I mentioned, there were encouraging signs in terms of that mix as we think about the back half of the quarter. But that liability mix, what's going on with sweeps will be the primary driver when you think about NII in the near term.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to touch on the Institutional Securities. And you had ultimately, I think, a pretty good quarter relative to the backdrop. And you mentioned that engagement really accelerated kind of towards to the back half of the quarter. So, I'm assuming kind of on the other side of the debt ceiling debate, things started to normalize a little bit. So, just want to talk about some of the puts and takes, and whether maybe the second quarter results, which are still the softest results, I think, since 2019 second quarter, if this is kind of a more normal outcome, or if you actually think that what you saw kind of in that recovery in the back half of the quarter is normalization and so therefore, we could actually bounce back from the outcome of the second quarter? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Let's take all of ISG first. So, when we think about what we've discussed a lot at length really about normal, post COVID has been for the overall ISG wallet to land between 2019 and 2020. Our view there broadly has not changed. In terms of where we expect ourselves to be, we've laid out a pretty clear sort of market share guidelines in terms of where we are from a wallet perspective. When you look specifically, you talked about fixed income, we've moved from 6% wallet share to 10% wallet share. So, I think the dramatic change that we've made in that business has really been around a client-centric franchise and making sure that we're there and able -- to be able to service our client base. What we talked about, as you highlight, is that there was less client activity for us this second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. But interestingly, as you mentioned, and you're right, we saw a dramatic change in that activity level, specifically in fixed income right after the debt ceiling debate. So, I think what we're looking to do is capture our fair share of the wallet. And that overall wallet in terms of normalization, we think will likely land between 2019 and 2020.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great color there. And then, just in terms of just this green shoot and kind of normalization theme, we are seeing in the equity capital markets, debt capital markets, some normalization. M&A still been pretty lackluster. And so, just curious whether you just feel like maybe that's more on a lag basis as capital markets recover, then M&A recovery would come next? Or is there something else kind of idiosyncratic to that market that may hold back results in that business? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. Remember that, of course, advisory is always going to be lagged just because of the announcement. So, we're digesting the fact that we had a very muted or a dearth of announcements if we look back six, nine months. If we think about the last month of the quarter, we began to see more announcements. And we're seeing that really in sector-specific that have a strategic dialogue around them. So be that financials where you might see industry consolidation, energy where you're seeing transitional discussions and reasons to actually have strategic dialogue. So, what gives us confidence is that you're seeing a broadening out of those strategic dialogues. Our backlog is building, and we're seeing it across various sectors we're having both backlog and discussions. But it is fair to say that advisory will likely lag simply because you are dealing with a lagged announcement pipeline from the last six to nine months.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. So, I want to drill down a little bit more on the $90 billion. I know it can be lumpy, but I didn't think it was [due to] (ph) workplace produced. But I wonder if you could drill down a little bit on what happened to work so well this quarter and this first half of the year. I mean, it bodes well for your doubling of pre-tax margin -- I'm sorry, doubling of pre-tax income for Wealth. But just curious on what's contributing to the good lumpiness lately, so obviously, well ahead of your $1 trillion every three-year pace.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you so much, Glenn, for the question. And yes, I think referencing Andy's speech that he gave for those of you who may not be aware, is helpful because it is an asset-led strategy when we think about where we see expansion in that business going forward. This particular quarter, historically, over the long term, we've generally said no one channel is contributing to over 25% of NNA. Interestingly, this quarter, we did see the advisor-led channel was a big proponent. And more than that, it was -- what was a big production part of the funnel was the assets held away from existing clients. This has been a strategy that we've been talking about back 2015 through [Technical Difficulty] to give advisors more time to begin to not only prospect new clients, but also really offer their existing clients better advice. And so that's where I think you're beginning to see a lot of that work in terms of aggregating assets held away, and we continue to believe that, that's a real opportunity for us to grow our asset base.\nJames Gorman: I just want to add on this a little bit because it's obviously been a focus of mine for many decades. The run rate, Glenn, as you know, for the three years before this was $1 trillion. So we're running about $330-ish billion a year. This year run rate, if you extend it would obviously be higher than that, it would be around $400 billion. But I think you're right, it's going to be lumpy. I mean you're going to have a quarter in here somewhere that's a $50 billion quarter, and I wouldn't get too excited about that. And just as I don't get too excited, we're ahead of the run rate. What I really care about, what I'm really excited about is it's a real thing. This is not just something that's going to stop. We've got a lot of wealthy clients. Just the dividends, the interest they get on their accounts, the money they're bringing in, the migration from the workplace, the migration from the E*TRADE accounts, it's the real deal. And I know we put out this $10 trillion number, which I think is -- I think this is going to happen. And at a 5% increase in the value annually on the portfolio with a $1 trillion every three years, it happens in a bit over five years. And it's just a pretty much unstoppable force, but there will be lumpiness in it. I'm sure of that. I don't know when, but there will be lumpy. This happened to be a great one. And I'm excited about it. I think we're heading to -- we're clearly heading to $10 trillion, which is at 50 basis points, $50 billion in revenue. And if you do the math compounding, and I know people are going to call me crazy, and I know it's the end of my tenure, so I get to do this kind of stuff. But if you do 5% over 14 years, you end up at $20 trillion, which is a $100 million revenue business. Well, that seems like a long way out, but I started this job 14 years ago, and we had much, much fewer than the $6.3 trillion we have today. So it's possible.\nGlenn Schorr: Wow. Maybe just one quickie, Sharon. You talked about sweeps, and it's too early to tell if we've settled in. I'm curious if you have any stats you can share on what percentage of FAs and/or what percentage of clients have accounted for most of the moving? I'm not sure what's [room for you] (ph) here, but curious on how widespread across the FA and client base the shifts have been or concentrated.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. In terms of the shift in terms of moving out of sweeps into savings or seeing savings products, we still have over 80% of our actual deposit base is coming from our own client base. What's interesting in terms of the movement of sweeps, which might be your question, I'm not sure I'm totally answering it, Glenn, is that we began to see some of those sweeps not just -- remember, we used to see them move into money markets or other cash alternatives. In June, we began to see some of those dollars actually move into markets, so various assets. We hadn't seen that trend since January. So that just shows that some of the clients are actually also deploying excess cash or cash equivalents actually into the marketplace as well.\nOperator: For our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning. So James, I appreciate your comments on Basel III Endgame. It might be helpful if you could just speak to how the lengthy transition period informs your near-term buyback appetite if at all? And given the RWA inflation could be quite meaningful, what are some of the mitigating actions you can pursue to alleviate some of the pressure on your businesses?\nJames Gorman: Well, again, I think, Steve, we've got to see the rule proposed first. I mean, without talking out of school, I clearly had conversations with all the appropriate regulatory bodies. And I'm encouraged by their response, which is they sincerely want to hear comments from the industry. They do understand capital changes across the whole industry have to result in the right economic outcome for the country. And by definition, the bank's stability, as evidenced by the recent many years of CCARs, shows that the G-SIB banks, the top eight banks for sure, are well capitalized. So, I don't want to get ahead and talk about what we'd mitigate. Clearly, we have flexibility around our RWAs. You saw that this quarter, we ended up with 15.5% CET1. We did that not really from a Basel III perspective. I mean, we had that in the back of my mind, but more from this environment, it was a little squarely. I mean, let's just say it that you had three bank fails at the beginning of the quarter. That wasn't a good look. So, we wanted to be cautious. And on the specific buyback, obviously, just on the dividend, we're totally comfortable with the dividend. We've said many, many times we regard half the company as a yield stock, and we're going to treat it that way. And the dividend increases you've seen, I think they're entirely appropriate, and I would expect they continue over coming years without saying exactly what level they're at. On the buyback, I mean, we would take advantage of weakness in the stock. We will be prudent. We're creating -- this was a very difficult quarter and we accreted $2 billion. So it's not like we're not making money here. And I'd like to see the rule, I guess, in a couple of weeks, Sharon, right, we're getting the rule and then the first range of comments. We'll be doing buybacks through this year. We have $20 billion authorization from the Board. We won't be doing $20 billion, but we'll be doing buybacks, and we'll moderate it. I think this thing is going to take -- as I said, I'd be surprised if this is all done and dusted by -- where are we, '23, by the end of '26. I think that's sort of -- and that's 3.5 years, which is a lifetime in these industries.\nSteven Chubak: No, it's a fair point, James. I mean, immediately, we all had the experience with Basel III when it wasn't going to get fully implemented for a period of years and the impacts were fully loaded. So, I think we're all just trying to prepare for maybe some expectation that it gets priced in a little bit more quickly.\nJames Gorman: It could. And we'll adapt, but we won't change our strategy. And I'm going to be a strong advocate on where I think some of these rules do not align with what is right for the global -- for the U.S. financial system and the U.S. economy, not just Morgan Stanley's self-interest.\nSteven Chubak: No, helpful perspective. If I could squeeze in one more here, just on Investment Management. The 30% margin goal that you've laid out for Wealth and IM, Wealth, when we adjust for the specials, of about 300 bps, you're within spitting distance of that 30%. The Investment Management margin, it's running in the mid-teens. And I recognize you're still integrating Eaton Vance. But what are your margin aspirations for that business? And what are some of the actions you're taking to maybe help close that gap?\nSharon Yeshaya: So, Steve, the margin goals that we've given have been really around Wealth Management. I respect your point though, we have given larger efficiency targets for the firm. And so, there are places where you all puts and takes between ISG and I am. Remember, if we look back less than 18 months ago or so, we did -- we were close to 30% margins in the IM business. So, what we've seen over the course of the last year or so has just been the cumulative impact of the outflows associated with changes in what investor appetite was, particularly around active equity. But also just the asset levels themselves that are associated with market. What's important to us is the diversification of the platform and then continuing to invest in where we see real changes in that business. And I mean -- by that business, I mean more broadly in an industry landscape. So things like customization consistently, every quarter, regardless of what we've seen sort of on the top-line, we continue to see increased flows, net inflows on the customization product. You saw -- we talked about a solutions-based product this additional quarter. So, we're leaning into where we see industry opportunities. And as we grow assets, similar to us growing assets on the Wealth Management side, that should help support the margin for the Investment Management business, which we do see as a through-the-cycle business.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr. Hawken, your line is now open.\nSharon Yeshaya: Operator, maybe we go to the next one and come back to Brennan.\nOperator: We'll move to the next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, this is the first chance we have to ask you about the CEO change, James. And just...\nJames Gorman: Mike, you asked me about CEO change in 2012. So, that's your second chance to ask me.\nMike Mayo: Yes, well, you survived and thrived, so there you go.\nJames Gorman: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nMike Mayo: But it's -- this is Wall Street and what have you done first lately and what's going to happen ahead. So, first, I don't understand what the Executive Chairman is. And I do hope you have in-person shareholder meetings again like you did in the past. And what will that mean when you're Executive Chairman? And what is your thought process on timing of the new CEO? And what are your considerations? I mean, we could all go through the candidates that we see in the press, but let's just hear it from you directly what you're thinking and what the Board is thinking who ultimately makes that decision?\nJames Gorman: Well, to take a few of those pieces, we're not going to have in-person shareholder meetings. Since the years I did this before COVID, we have more people from security than we did shareholders physically in the meeting. So, let's just be honest, it was an enormous waste of time and money. And while one or two people might ask -- like asking question in-person, I just don't think it's a good use of time and money. But that along with my pet peeve that we shouldn't have quarterly earnings reports, they should be every six months. That'll be two immediate changes I would make if I was God of Finance. But that's not what you really asked about. On the CEO stuff, I mean, Mike, we -- I said about five years ago, I'd stepped down about five years. I said three years ago to be three years, and nobody believed me. So, I said the best way to get people to believe and the Board agree with this strategy was that the annual meeting to say I won't be in the job of the next annual meeting. So that makes it very clear. it's 12 months. We're already two months in. When exactly that happens, frankly, just isn't that relevant. I mean whether it happens tomorrow, it happens on May, whatever it is 15th or something next annual meeting is irrelevant, it will happen somewhere between those dates. There's a few things I think just given my tenure, I can probably get done that will help the new CEO get off to a great start. And that is my intent. I want somebody to do this job as well better than I've done it for the next several years and to thrive in it. And the best way to help them is to get them off to a good start. So the exact timing will be just driven by that. Obviously, given the questions here on Basel III Endgame, that's an important thing for me to dig into over the next few months. We just got the CCAR stuff done. We got the dividend done. We're chipping away at what I call the remaining pieces. The Board will ultimately decide. We have a process. It's a committee, the Comp, Management Development Succession Committee chaired by Dennis Nally, runs that process. He reports to the Board, obviously, and the full Board will ultimately choose the next CEO. And I'm sure at some point, they want my formal input on that, but they're doing their processes, they should independently. And I think it's very healthy. So the criteria you look for, obviously, not necessarily who's the business operator running a given business on a given day, but who's best equipped to deal with the multiple constituencies and challenges of running a global bank. And that's what the Board will figure out. So saying more than that, I think, would be inappropriate because it gets ahead of the Board's process. And that's their job. And I'm just here to help along the way. So hopefully, that clarifies it, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Yes. Just one follow-up. So that -- at least I guess there's three contenders, the three heads of the business lines, if that's correct. And I guess that means maybe two people don't get the job. What's a good technique for your firm or any firm to make sure that those people who don't get the top job are still made part -- still stay with the firm and still a part of everything that's happening?\nJames Gorman: Wall Street had a history of that not happening. I think we will -- frankly we will challenge that history. We have an unbelievable team that worked together for at least eight years. I think they've all been on the operating committee and we have an unbelievable team of executives around them. Sharon, who you're hearing on this call; Eric Grossman, our Chief Legal Officer; Clare Woodman, who runs Europe, Middle East; and so on and so on. So, we have a lot of very talented executives. That'll be for myself, frankly, to help navigate that path, but these jobs are enormous jobs, whether it's CEO or President or COO of these global companies and we're one of the largest companies in the world. So I'm confident we'll end up in a great place, Mike.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Hopefully you can hear me now.\nJames Gorman: Go ahead, Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: All right. Sorry about that before. So, Sharon, I know you mentioned before about the NII and the deposit cost having a big impact, but actually the deposit cost trends were roughly in line with what we were looking for and yet NII turned out to be a little better than expected. Could you tell us -- we don't have great visibility on the asset side. Did something happen on the asset side were you able to reprice some assets? And how much more of that do we have potentially on the come?\nSharon Yeshaya: There were some places where we benefited from the asset side. But as you know, we'll have to look at the ALM mix and it will be dependent on some of the market rates that we see going forward. So, unfortunately, there's not that much more clarity I can give you other than what is leading us as we go forward is largely that liability mix. And so that's the trend that will when we look out in the next couple of quarters is one of the biggest trends that will drive NII from here.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I noticed, I know it can diverge sometimes, but the trends for firm-wide NII were different, down about $300 million quarter-over-quarter. So, could you help us maybe understand why was that the firm-wide NII deferred substantially from the Wealth Management trends?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes, that was largely just associated with the trading position. And as you know, it depends on many things, including what products you have, where they're booked, how they're booked and what type of instrument, and in addition, various types of funding costs. So, it's really the -- I think when we look and we manage the business specifically on the trading side given our portfolio and how we think about our bank versus just the broader broker dealer, et cetera, we don't manage it on an NII basis. When we're looking at NII, NII is clearly a driver from the Wealth Management side.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Another question on wealth and acknowledging the strong NNA number in aggregate. What do you think we need to see for the fee-based NNA to begin to get closer in size to the total NNA? And maybe what you think longer term that mix will look like?\nSharon Yeshaya: Great question. We've looked a lot at fee based and thought about sort of as we think about the funnel. One thing that we highlighted to you last year, or last quarter rather, was that from the advisor-led side, we still had around 23% of those assets and cash and cash equivalents. That is a historical average of the last five years is around 18%. So, in our mind, a lot of it has to do with the way that people are looking at the markets right now. And the idea that when you're moving into a fee-based asset, specifically on the retail side, you are doing so and you're actually, obviously, actively investing in different market assets. And so what is encouraging is as I highlighted on, I think, to the question Glenn asked is that in the last month of the quarter, we began to see individual retail clients actually put that money into markets. So that's an encouraging sign, but we do think that a portion of that is market dependent.\nDan Fannon: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, can you give us some color, when the E*TRADE deal was closed, I think it was back in October of 2020, one of the real attractions, I think, for Morgan Stanley was the workplace channel. And you guys are, obviously, a dominant player in this workplace channel. Are there any metrics that you can share with us on the success you're having in increasing the penetration in that channel?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. We've talked a lot in the last two quarterly updates around just the movement that we see in terms of channel migration is what we've called it. So, workplace assets that are then some portion of it is moved into the advisor-led side. And then, from that sort of as a core, you see assets held away beginning to come in. For the first three years that we had that, that number was around $150 billion, so call it $50 billion a quarter. And then, in the first quarter of this year, we were -- for that one quarter, we saw $28 billion. And when you look at the first half, we're largely running almost up to a full year rate of last year. And so, what that puts into account is we are seeing encouraging signs. We don't know exactly where that number will land, but obviously, it's trending in a good direction. And what it shows again is that workplace can begin to be sort of a seed to the conversation that people have with advisors. And you see that being 10%, 20% of the assets that are brought in through the migration, the other 80% or so are coming in from assets held away.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, James, just to circle back to the capital comments that you made with the Basel III Endgame and we've heard from some of your peers about the engagement with the regulators appears to be stronger this time maybe than in past. Can you share with us your feelings when you think about what you guys all went through post the financial crisis and the new regulations that came from Dodd Frank? Do you think the regulators are really listening to you folks more so this time than in the past, or is that not the case?\nJames Gorman: Well, I think, Gerard, it's early. We need see the rule. The test -- there's one thing to listen and there's another thing to listen and act. The test is, once the regulatory community receives feedback from the industry groups, which are very coordinated, I will say, what input do they take into account? Frankly, how do we compare what the European banks have done on their own regulations? So, I think bringing the U.S. to sort of a gold plated European standard just doesn't feel to me like the right end outcome. I think we should do what's right for the U.S. financial system. Yes, I think they're listening. They've shown an interest in -- a strong interest in getting the feedback from the industry, the communities, the legislative bodies, et cetera. So -- but the proof will be in the putting. We'll find out over the next -- I don't know how long it will take the comment period. I'm assuming it could be a year or so. I mean, this is a big deal. Remember, Basel III Endgame first proposed in 2017, so it's taken six years to make its way in a small sailing boat across the Atlantic. And here it is. So, now we've got to decide what we like about, what we don't. So, I'm maintaining constructive tone, because I think everybody wants to end up in the right place. I don't happen to think and this is contrary to some people's views that the Silicon Valley, First Republic have a whole lot to do with this stuff, but that's a different discussion for later days. So, yes, I would hope and expect that they're going to listen, because they -- we should be listening to each other.\nOperator: For our next question, we'll move to Andrew Lim with SocGen. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to circle back again on Basel III as well. So, I think your comments about European banks having maybe a bit more work to do, a lot of them are guiding towards impacts on the quantitative basis at the low end, sort of like below 50 basis points. So, I was just wondering if you saw something a bit more specific that might level the playing field for the European banks versus U.S. banks debate? And then, turning over to the U.S. banks, obviously, we're all familiar with the large impacts that have been talked about by Jerome Powell and Michael Barr. One of your competitors was a bit more forthcoming saying that that might allude to operational risk weighted assets being added to total, standardized risk weighted assets, which currently isn't the case under the standardized approach. So, I was wondering if you had any like specific thoughts about that, or whether you thought that was a bit more -- a bit less relevant given that, that would allude to legacy RMBS losses from many years ago. How do you think about that?\nJames Gorman: Well, I'm not going to go into more detail about the European banks. I was just observing that the system was set up many years ago under Basel European banks, some of which are fully compliant with it and some are not yet. And the country system was set up in the U.S. of CCAR. So, we've actually had a capital stress test system for at least, I don't know, 12 years or something. So that was simply the observation. On the operational risk standardized approach to risk weighted assets, yes, actually that is very clearly going to be in the proposal. That is the Basel III proposal and that is going to be in the initial readout. I think, from the U.S. proposal, where that ends up, I've made my position very clear on that. But tying standardized RWAs to fee-based business is not -- just doesn't make sense to me. So, up until now we've had idiosyncratic evaluation of specific bank operational risk and the regulators are trying to move a standardized approach. How they get there, when we get there remains a lot to be seen. A lot of work to be done on that.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We started the second quarter with significant headwinds and uncertainties, and it's fair to say that we ended the quarter overall in a better place with a better tone. The headwinds reflect the ongoing market transition from a high-inflation, low-rate environment to a higher-rate, lower-inflation environment. In addition, there were several other issues impacting the markets. April started on the heels of the first bank crisis since 2008, which had the risk of bleeding into the broader financial system. Prompt action by regulators and what turned out to be idiosyncratic stories of the failed banks combined with the strength and support from the large U.S. banks helped to rebalance the system. Second, we found our country moving headlong into a debt ceiling crisis. While our view was it was likely to be resolved, there is no doubt it created unnecessary uncertainty in the markets in April and May. Thirdly, after rapidly raising rates over 15 months, the Fed reached a pause, if not a plateau at its recent meeting. And while we may not be quite at the end of rate increases, I believe we're very, very close to it. Finally, strong rhetoric from government leaders from both the U.S. and China in recent weeks is evident, but there's now been recent efforts to normalize relations and a constructive dialogue is surely welcome. Seeing these four not-insignificant macro concerns progressed positively, supported a more constructive tone in the markets, particularly evidenced in the last few weeks of the quarter. Beyond more macro issues, we at Morgan Stanley completed a significant part of the E*TRADE back-office integration with the final part to be completed after Labor Day and we're very pleased with how it's gone. And today, we announced new institutional initiatives with Japanese research and equity and in foreign exchange with our long standing partner, MUFG, further evidence of how our businesses can work together over time to best serve our global clients. And importantly, we received the most recent results of CCAR. We're pleased our performance under the stress test has improved for the fourth consecutive year, every year since the SCB was introduced. Given our strong results, we increased our dividend by $0.075, the same as we did last year. That brings our total annual dividend per share to $3.40 annually with a dividend yield of about 4% given the current stock price. As to the financial performance of the firm this quarter, certain key metrics were encouraging. Net new assets in Wealth Management grew by $90 billion, and combined with inflows from Investment Management, we saw over $100 billion, bringing our year-to-date net new assets to approximately $200 billion in six months. Our year-to-date growth is well ahead of pace, and while obviously any quarter can bounce around and that will happen, our consistent growth in net new assets in Wealth Management is evidence of our scale and our expanded channels and the clients that we serve. Second, our institutional businesses navigated a choppy environment well. And altogether, the firm delivered net revenues of over $13 billion, up 2% from last year when conditions were very different. This translates into an ROTCE of 12%. Finally, our CET1 ratio was 15.5%. While we knew this would significantly exceed our capital requirements, and it did, it reflects our desire to remain highly capitalized in the face of the new unfolding Basel III Endgame. It's too early to predict the rate of market improvement through the rest of 2023, but the more positive tone and activity seen later in the quarter across many parts of our business is promising. Of course, how much it moves through the balance of the year remains unknown. That said, the fundamentals of our business model remain strong. Finally, a brief comment on succession. At the annual meeting in May, I made it clear I would transition out of the CEO role before next year's annual meeting. Succession planning should be intentional and managed just like strategic planning for the firm or any of our critical talent management processes. We are and have been dealing with a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the CCAR results, business environment, Basel III upcoming Endgame proposals and certain other pending matters. I committed to the Board that I lead our response to those issues, and when I do transition out of the CEO role, I remain as Executive Chairman for a period of time. We are fortunate indeed to have three very strong internal candidates that the Board continues to evaluate along appropriate processes for their readiness to step up as the next CEO of Morgan Stanley. I'll now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you. Good morning. Well, it's an important question. And you're right, I have made comments on it. Let's sort of set the table of where we are right now. We've had a lot of speculation based off of what the Basel III Endgame looks like. By the way, I'm not sure it's actually being implemented fully in Europe, just to say. I think the U.S. banks actually have more capital, but putting that knit aside, we did get the speech from the Vice Chair. I think it's important to look at the title of that speech, which was holistic capital review. So, it's taking into account all of the CCAR, stress tests, SCB buffers and the like as this stuff is implemented. Secondly, we haven't seen the actual rules. I mean, I guess there will be a proposal coming out, as you said, in a couple of weeks. There will be an extensive comment period. There is clearly very different views as to the need for the U.S. banking system to accrete more capital. In fact, if you look at the test of the last few years, what happened with the regional banks, what -- Silicon Valley First Republic Signature, what happened during COVID, what's happened during this period of high inflation, what's happened with the biggest rate increase we've had in 40 years, put all that together, the U.S. large banks actually did really well. In fact, if not all of them, certainly for Morgan Stanley, our capital position improved four years in a row under CCAR. So, it's kind of hard for me to sit here and say that we won't be commenting forcefully that we are very well capitalized. But there will be an extensive comment period. I suspect what comes out of that will not be the same as what starts. I think in the sausage making, there will be a lot of evaluation. Clearly, the intent is not to harm the U.S. banking system, which is the backbone of the economy. It's to strengthen us. Then there will be a long transition period. So, I just happen to be reading the speech from the Vice Chair in the last couple of days, and he had a paragraph in there anticipating this question. I thought I'd read to any proposed changes would go through the standard notice and comment rule-making process, allowing for all interested parties appropriate time. Any final changes to capital requirements would occur with appropriate transition times. And he goes on again later in his speech to point out, it could be -- it will not be fully effective for some years. So, here we are in 2023. I don't think this is going to happen in any meaningful way before the end of 2026. I think what comes out a year from now after comment period will be very different from what goes in. And just take my personal peep in it, which is applying a standardized RWA hit on operating risk as the various regulators trying to figure out what the right way to assess operating risk capital is. And to put a standardized hit is fine, but to do it based on fee income, which is the current European proposal, seems to me to be nuts. I mean, we're not -- you don't build fee-based businesses to create operating risk. You build them to create stability. So that's a point we've made very clear with the regulators, and I think they're taking it under consideration. So, long story short, yes, it's the final trust. It's ironic, I don't believe all the European banks are complying with their own rules. We have a very healthy robust capital system here that's been tested 12 years in a row. Morgan Stanley has done well. And there is no chance there will be a major strategic shift for Morgan Stanley as a result of any of this, is my conclusion. I just want to add on this a little bit because it's obviously been a focus of mine for many decades. The run rate, Glenn, as you know, for the three years before this was $1 trillion. So we're running about $330-ish billion a year. This year run rate, if you extend it would obviously be higher than that, it would be around $400 billion. But I think you're right, it's going to be lumpy. I mean you're going to have a quarter in here somewhere that's a $50 billion quarter, and I wouldn't get too excited about that. And just as I don't get too excited, we're ahead of the run rate. What I really care about, what I'm really excited about is it's a real thing. This is not just something that's going to stop. We've got a lot of wealthy clients. Just the dividends, the interest they get on their accounts, the money they're bringing in, the migration from the workplace, the migration from the E*TRADE accounts, it's the real deal. And I know we put out this $10 trillion number, which I think is -- I think this is going to happen. And at a 5% increase in the value annually on the portfolio with a $1 trillion every three years, it happens in a bit over five years. And it's just a pretty much unstoppable force, but there will be lumpiness in it. I'm sure of that. I don't know when, but there will be lumpy. This happened to be a great one. And I'm excited about it. I think we're heading to -- we're clearly heading to $10 trillion, which is at 50 basis points, $50 billion in revenue. And if you do the math compounding, and I know people are going to call me crazy, and I know it's the end of my tenure, so I get to do this kind of stuff. But if you do 5% over 14 years, you end up at $20 trillion, which is a $100 million revenue business. Well, that seems like a long way out, but I started this job 14 years ago, and we had much, much fewer than the $6.3 trillion we have today. So it's possible. Well, again, I think, Steve, we've got to see the rule proposed first. I mean, without talking out of school, I clearly had conversations with all the appropriate regulatory bodies. And I'm encouraged by their response, which is they sincerely want to hear comments from the industry. They do understand capital changes across the whole industry have to result in the right economic outcome for the country. And by definition, the bank's stability, as evidenced by the recent many years of CCARs, shows that the G-SIB banks, the top eight banks for sure, are well capitalized. So, I don't want to get ahead and talk about what we'd mitigate. Clearly, we have flexibility around our RWAs. You saw that this quarter, we ended up with 15.5% CET1. We did that not really from a Basel III perspective. I mean, we had that in the back of my mind, but more from this environment, it was a little squarely. I mean, let's just say it that you had three bank fails at the beginning of the quarter. That wasn't a good look. So, we wanted to be cautious. And on the specific buyback, obviously, just on the dividend, we're totally comfortable with the dividend. We've said many, many times we regard half the company as a yield stock, and we're going to treat it that way. And the dividend increases you've seen, I think they're entirely appropriate, and I would expect they continue over coming years without saying exactly what level they're at. On the buyback, I mean, we would take advantage of weakness in the stock. We will be prudent. We're creating -- this was a very difficult quarter and we accreted $2 billion. So it's not like we're not making money here. And I'd like to see the rule, I guess, in a couple of weeks, Sharon, right, we're getting the rule and then the first range of comments. We'll be doing buybacks through this year. We have $20 billion authorization from the Board. We won't be doing $20 billion, but we'll be doing buybacks, and we'll moderate it. I think this thing is going to take -- as I said, I'd be surprised if this is all done and dusted by -- where are we, '23, by the end of '26. I think that's sort of -- and that's 3.5 years, which is a lifetime in these industries. It could. And we'll adapt, but we won't change our strategy. And I'm going to be a strong advocate on where I think some of these rules do not align with what is right for the global -- for the U.S. financial system and the U.S. economy, not just Morgan Stanley's self-interest. Mike, you asked me about CEO change in 2012. So, that's your second chance to ask me. Thank you. I appreciate that. Well, to take a few of those pieces, we're not going to have in-person shareholder meetings. Since the years I did this before COVID, we have more people from security than we did shareholders physically in the meeting. So, let's just be honest, it was an enormous waste of time and money. And while one or two people might ask -- like asking question in-person, I just don't think it's a good use of time and money. But that along with my pet peeve that we shouldn't have quarterly earnings reports, they should be every six months. That'll be two immediate changes I would make if I was God of Finance. But that's not what you really asked about. On the CEO stuff, I mean, Mike, we -- I said about five years ago, I'd stepped down about five years. I said three years ago to be three years, and nobody believed me. So, I said the best way to get people to believe and the Board agree with this strategy was that the annual meeting to say I won't be in the job of the next annual meeting. So that makes it very clear. it's 12 months. We're already two months in. When exactly that happens, frankly, just isn't that relevant. I mean whether it happens tomorrow, it happens on May, whatever it is 15th or something next annual meeting is irrelevant, it will happen somewhere between those dates. There's a few things I think just given my tenure, I can probably get done that will help the new CEO get off to a great start. And that is my intent. I want somebody to do this job as well better than I've done it for the next several years and to thrive in it. And the best way to help them is to get them off to a good start. So the exact timing will be just driven by that. Obviously, given the questions here on Basel III Endgame, that's an important thing for me to dig into over the next few months. We just got the CCAR stuff done. We got the dividend done. We're chipping away at what I call the remaining pieces. The Board will ultimately decide. We have a process. It's a committee, the Comp, Management Development Succession Committee chaired by Dennis Nally, runs that process. He reports to the Board, obviously, and the full Board will ultimately choose the next CEO. And I'm sure at some point, they want my formal input on that, but they're doing their processes, they should independently. And I think it's very healthy. So the criteria you look for, obviously, not necessarily who's the business operator running a given business on a given day, but who's best equipped to deal with the multiple constituencies and challenges of running a global bank. And that's what the Board will figure out. So saying more than that, I think, would be inappropriate because it gets ahead of the Board's process. And that's their job. And I'm just here to help along the way. So hopefully, that clarifies it, Mike. Wall Street had a history of that not happening. I think we will -- frankly we will challenge that history. We have an unbelievable team that worked together for at least eight years. I think they've all been on the operating committee and we have an unbelievable team of executives around them. Sharon, who you're hearing on this call; Eric Grossman, our Chief Legal Officer; Clare Woodman, who runs Europe, Middle East; and so on and so on. So, we have a lot of very talented executives. That'll be for myself, frankly, to help navigate that path, but these jobs are enormous jobs, whether it's CEO or President or COO of these global companies and we're one of the largest companies in the world. So I'm confident we'll end up in a great place, Mike. Go ahead, Brennan. Well, I think, Gerard, it's early. We need see the rule. The test -- there's one thing to listen and there's another thing to listen and act. The test is, once the regulatory community receives feedback from the industry groups, which are very coordinated, I will say, what input do they take into account? Frankly, how do we compare what the European banks have done on their own regulations? So, I think bringing the U.S. to sort of a gold plated European standard just doesn't feel to me like the right end outcome. I think we should do what's right for the U.S. financial system. Yes, I think they're listening. They've shown an interest in -- a strong interest in getting the feedback from the industry, the communities, the legislative bodies, et cetera. So -- but the proof will be in the putting. We'll find out over the next -- I don't know how long it will take the comment period. I'm assuming it could be a year or so. I mean, this is a big deal. Remember, Basel III Endgame first proposed in 2017, so it's taken six years to make its way in a small sailing boat across the Atlantic. And here it is. So, now we've got to decide what we like about, what we don't. So, I'm maintaining constructive tone, because I think everybody wants to end up in the right place. I don't happen to think and this is contrary to some people's views that the Silicon Valley, First Republic have a whole lot to do with this stuff, but that's a different discussion for later days. So, yes, I would hope and expect that they're going to listen, because they -- we should be listening to each other. Well, I'm not going to go into more detail about the European banks. I was just observing that the system was set up many years ago under Basel European banks, some of which are fully compliant with it and some are not yet. And the country system was set up in the U.S. of CCAR. So, we've actually had a capital stress test system for at least, I don't know, 12 years or something. So that was simply the observation. On the operational risk standardized approach to risk weighted assets, yes, actually that is very clearly going to be in the proposal. That is the Basel III proposal and that is going to be in the initial readout. I think, from the U.S. proposal, where that ends up, I've made my position very clear on that. But tying standardized RWAs to fee-based business is not -- just doesn't make sense to me. So, up until now we've had idiosyncratic evaluation of specific bank operational risk and the regulators are trying to move a standardized approach. How they get there, when we get there remains a lot to be seen. A lot of work to be done on that."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $13.5 billion. Our EPS was $1.24, and our ROTCE was 12.1%. Reported results include severance charges of approximately $300 million. This reduced EPS by $0.14 and ROTCE by about 140 basis points. As James discussed, sentiment and activity improved towards the end of the quarter, evidenced by green shoots that emerged across our businesses. In Institutional Securities, client engagement progressively picked up. And in Wealth Management, we witnessed a moderation of sweep outflows as well as the stabilization of retail investments into cash and cash equivalents. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 75%. In addition to severance, expenses for the quarter included $99 million of costs associated with the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, approximately 75% of which relates to E*TRADE. Together, severance and this year's integration represent an impact of about 175 basis points to the year-to-date efficiency ratio. For the balance of the year, our expectations for total integration expenses are broadly in line with our prior guidance, with approximately $150 million remaining. Looking towards the back half of 2023, we continue to balance investments with the operating environment. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues of $5.7 billion declined 8% versus last year. With overall client activity -- while overall client activity was lower compared to the prior period, results improved as the quarter progressed, alongside better market conditions. Investment banking revenues were flat compared to a year ago. Although advisory remained under pressure, a pickup in underwriting supported results. Advisory revenues of $455 million reflected lower completed M&A volumes. Equity underwriting revenues were $225 million. While IPO activity remained muted, results were supported by follow-on and convertibles, encouraging signs that equity and equity-linked markets were opened at times for regular weight issuance. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $395 million, up year-over-year, driven mostly by investment-grade bond issuance, where corporates and financials took advantage of constructive markets in May and June, respectively. Investment-grade markets remain resilient against an uncertain backdrop. Across investment banking, client activity trended positively as the quarter progressed. The preannounced M&A backlog grew consistently throughout the quarter with a potential plateau in rates and lower implied volatility, client dialogue is currently active. We continue to invest in the franchise and have made selective senior hires to enhance our footprint to best position for the opportunity. While we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown and it is hard to know whether positive trends will continue for the near term, current conditions remain encouraging, certainly for the medium-term outlook and especially for 2024. Equity revenues were $2.5 billion, down 14% compared to strong results in the previous second quarter due to lower activity and lower market volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were solid, supported by increasing average client balances, consistent with rising market levels. Cash and derivatives declined versus last year on lower global volumes and lower market volatility. Fixed income revenues of $1.7 billion decreased compared to last year's elevated results. Solid performance reflects tempered client activity and prudent risk management. However, improved market conditions in June shifted client sentiment and supported the quarter's overall results. Macro revenues were down year-over-year, attributed to the declines in foreign exchange and a challenging environment and reduced activity, partially offset by the pickup in client engagement following the resolution of the debt ceiling debate and performance in rates. Micro results declined versus last year, predominantly on the back of lower client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly compared to the robust prior year, which benefited from volatile energy markets. Other revenues of $315 million improved versus last year, largely driven by lower mark-to-market losses net of hedges and higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans held for sale. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. Our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.4 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $97 million. The increase was driven by continued negative outlook for commercial real estate and modest portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $30 million, and were substantially all from a handful of specific loans from our corporate lending portfolio. Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $6.7 billion, a record. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were $6.6 billion and increased 5%, supported by higher net interest income. Results demonstrate the strength of the business model and our ability to continue to serve clients throughout different market environments. Pretax profit was $1.7 billion, with a PBT margin of 25.2%. Severance charges were $78 million and integration-related expenses were $75 million. Taken together and with the impact of DCP, these three factors were a drag in the margin of approximately 300 basis points. Despite the challenging market backdrop, the business model continued to deliver against our core objectives. Most notably, Wealth Management delivered $90 billion of net new assets, demonstrating our platform's ability to grow in various market environments. Net new assets were driven by our advisor-led channel, existing client consolidation and net recruiting were strong and offset seasonal tax-related outflows in April. Our early investments in technology, including data and AI, are providing advisers with tools to service current clients better and more efficiently prospect new business, including from our workplace channel. Also significant, as James mentioned, we are pleased to share that we've accomplished an integral part of E*TRADE's back-office integration, converting over 3 million E*TRADE accounts to Morgan Stanley's unified platform. We did this with virtually no client disruption, which has always been a critical priority. We expect to finish our integration efforts on time in the second half of this year. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Performance was solid down the line in light of the environment. Asset management revenues were $3.5 billion, down 2% versus last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $869 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 2% year-over-year, reflective of lower client activity for most of the quarter. Fee-based flows were $22.7 billion. Bank lending balances grew by $1.1 billion, driven by mortgages, offsetting paydowns in securities-based lending. Total deposits of $343 billion were up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Sweep outflows moderated during May and June compared to April, which included seasonal tax outflows. The recent month's trends are encouraging, but it remains too early to be declarative. Net interest income of $2.2 billion was virtually flat versus the prior quarter. The impact of lower sweep balances and higher funding costs were offset by higher rates. Looking towards the rest of the year, we do not expect NII to expand. Results will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of various rates. Similar to the institutional business, retail sentiment improved as the quarter progressed. For the first time since the beginning of the year, June saw positive monthly flows into equity markets from advisor-led sweep balances. We are encouraged by this more recent activity and remain well positioned to support ongoing asset growth and our clients through market cycles. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.3 billion declined 9% from the prior second quarter, primarily reflecting lower performance-based income and the cumulative impact of lower asset levels over the course of the year, commensurate with the market environment. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion, declining 3% year-over-year, reflecting the stability and diversification of our client franchise. Performance-based income and other revenues declined year-over-year due to the challenging investing environment in certain asset classes and markets, such as real estate and Asia private equity. Solid performance in other areas of our private alternative strategies acted as a partial offset, reflecting the diversity of our platform and our capital-light, client-driven alternative franchise. Total AUM increased $1.4 trillion. Our integration with Eaton Vance continues to progress well. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter. Long-term net flows were positive. Inflows were driven by ongoing demand in alternatives and solutions, which offset outflows in equities and fixed income. Within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios, private credit and private equity continue -- excuse me, remain consistent sources of net inflows, underscoring the benefits of our diverse platform. Additionally, this quarter, alternatives and solutions benefited from a significant inflow related to a portfolio solutions mandate. Liquidity and overlay services had an inflows of $9.7 billion, supported by ongoing demand for money market funds. We continue to be very well positioned in secular growth areas, such as customization in private markets, across geographies and with our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $35 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.5%, up approximately 40 basis points versus the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs declined about $9 billion from the prior quarter to $450 billion due to market conditions and continued prudent resource management. Recent stress test results reaffirmed our strong capital position and our durable business model. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075 and renewed our $20 billion multi-year repurchase authorization. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting our global mix of earnings. While we outperformed our tax guidance in the first half, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23% in the second half of this year, consistent with our initial guidance. Although we cannot be sure how the backdrop will play out for the rest of 2023, our priority of the management team is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities. Should stable and higher asset levels prevail, Wealth and Investment Management are poised to benefit, particularly as we continue to attract net new assets, a testament to our asset growth strategy. Within Institutional Securities, while advisory will lag the financing market, the backlog is building and underwriting trends are positive. Open and functioning markets remain key to supporting client conviction and activity levels. Most critically, our business continues to advance our clear and consistent firm strategy, driving long-term growth while remaining well capitalized. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. It will depend really -- Ebrahim, thanks for the question. It really depends on the deposit mix. And so, as I mentioned, there were encouraging signs in terms of that mix as we think about the back half of the quarter. But that liability mix, what's going on with sweeps will be the primary driver when you think about NII in the near term. Sure. Let's take all of ISG first. So, when we think about what we've discussed a lot at length really about normal, post COVID has been for the overall ISG wallet to land between 2019 and 2020. Our view there broadly has not changed. In terms of where we expect ourselves to be, we've laid out a pretty clear sort of market share guidelines in terms of where we are from a wallet perspective. When you look specifically, you talked about fixed income, we've moved from 6% wallet share to 10% wallet share. So, I think the dramatic change that we've made in that business has really been around a client-centric franchise and making sure that we're there and able -- to be able to service our client base. What we talked about, as you highlight, is that there was less client activity for us this second quarter compared to last year's second quarter. But interestingly, as you mentioned, and you're right, we saw a dramatic change in that activity level, specifically in fixed income right after the debt ceiling debate. So, I think what we're looking to do is capture our fair share of the wallet. And that overall wallet in terms of normalization, we think will likely land between 2019 and 2020. Yes. Remember that, of course, advisory is always going to be lagged just because of the announcement. So, we're digesting the fact that we had a very muted or a dearth of announcements if we look back six, nine months. If we think about the last month of the quarter, we began to see more announcements. And we're seeing that really in sector-specific that have a strategic dialogue around them. So be that financials where you might see industry consolidation, energy where you're seeing transitional discussions and reasons to actually have strategic dialogue. So, what gives us confidence is that you're seeing a broadening out of those strategic dialogues. Our backlog is building, and we're seeing it across various sectors we're having both backlog and discussions. But it is fair to say that advisory will likely lag simply because you are dealing with a lagged announcement pipeline from the last six to nine months. Thank you so much, Glenn, for the question. And yes, I think referencing Andy's speech that he gave for those of you who may not be aware, is helpful because it is an asset-led strategy when we think about where we see expansion in that business going forward. This particular quarter, historically, over the long term, we've generally said no one channel is contributing to over 25% of NNA. Interestingly, this quarter, we did see the advisor-led channel was a big proponent. And more than that, it was -- what was a big production part of the funnel was the assets held away from existing clients. This has been a strategy that we've been talking about back 2015 through [Technical Difficulty] to give advisors more time to begin to not only prospect new clients, but also really offer their existing clients better advice. And so that's where I think you're beginning to see a lot of that work in terms of aggregating assets held away, and we continue to believe that, that's a real opportunity for us to grow our asset base. Yes. In terms of the shift in terms of moving out of sweeps into savings or seeing savings products, we still have over 80% of our actual deposit base is coming from our own client base. What's interesting in terms of the movement of sweeps, which might be your question, I'm not sure I'm totally answering it, Glenn, is that we began to see some of those sweeps not just -- remember, we used to see them move into money markets or other cash alternatives. In June, we began to see some of those dollars actually move into markets, so various assets. We hadn't seen that trend since January. So that just shows that some of the clients are actually also deploying excess cash or cash equivalents actually into the marketplace as well. So, Steve, the margin goals that we've given have been really around Wealth Management. I respect your point though, we have given larger efficiency targets for the firm. And so, there are places where you all puts and takes between ISG and I am. Remember, if we look back less than 18 months ago or so, we did -- we were close to 30% margins in the IM business. So, what we've seen over the course of the last year or so has just been the cumulative impact of the outflows associated with changes in what investor appetite was, particularly around active equity. But also just the asset levels themselves that are associated with market. What's important to us is the diversification of the platform and then continuing to invest in where we see real changes in that business. And I mean -- by that business, I mean more broadly in an industry landscape. So things like customization consistently, every quarter, regardless of what we've seen sort of on the top-line, we continue to see increased flows, net inflows on the customization product. You saw -- we talked about a solutions-based product this additional quarter. So, we're leaning into where we see industry opportunities. And as we grow assets, similar to us growing assets on the Wealth Management side, that should help support the margin for the Investment Management business, which we do see as a through-the-cycle business. Operator, maybe we go to the next one and come back to Brennan. There were some places where we benefited from the asset side. But as you know, we'll have to look at the ALM mix and it will be dependent on some of the market rates that we see going forward. So, unfortunately, there's not that much more clarity I can give you other than what is leading us as we go forward is largely that liability mix. And so that's the trend that will when we look out in the next couple of quarters is one of the biggest trends that will drive NII from here. Yes, that was largely just associated with the trading position. And as you know, it depends on many things, including what products you have, where they're booked, how they're booked and what type of instrument, and in addition, various types of funding costs. So, it's really the -- I think when we look and we manage the business specifically on the trading side given our portfolio and how we think about our bank versus just the broader broker dealer, et cetera, we don't manage it on an NII basis. When we're looking at NII, NII is clearly a driver from the Wealth Management side. Great question. We've looked a lot at fee based and thought about sort of as we think about the funnel. One thing that we highlighted to you last year, or last quarter rather, was that from the advisor-led side, we still had around 23% of those assets and cash and cash equivalents. That is a historical average of the last five years is around 18%. So, in our mind, a lot of it has to do with the way that people are looking at the markets right now. And the idea that when you're moving into a fee-based asset, specifically on the retail side, you are doing so and you're actually, obviously, actively investing in different market assets. And so what is encouraging is as I highlighted on, I think, to the question Glenn asked is that in the last month of the quarter, we began to see individual retail clients actually put that money into markets. So that's an encouraging sign, but we do think that a portion of that is market dependent. Yes. We've talked a lot in the last two quarterly updates around just the movement that we see in terms of channel migration is what we've called it. So, workplace assets that are then some portion of it is moved into the advisor-led side. And then, from that sort of as a core, you see assets held away beginning to come in. For the first three years that we had that, that number was around $150 billion, so call it $50 billion a quarter. And then, in the first quarter of this year, we were -- for that one quarter, we saw $28 billion. And when you look at the first half, we're largely running almost up to a full year rate of last year. And so, what that puts into account is we are seeing encouraging signs. We don't know exactly where that number will land, but obviously, it's trending in a good direction. And what it shows again is that workplace can begin to be sort of a seed to the conversation that people have with advisors. And you see that being 10%, 20% of the assets that are brought in through the migration, the other 80% or so are coming in from assets held away."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.\nJames Gorman: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2023 was very eventful for our industry, but not so eventful for Morgan Stanley. Firm delivered strong results with revenues of over $14.5 billion, net income of $3 billion, ROTCE of 17% and net new asset flows of $110 billion. At the same time, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock while maintaining a CET ratio of 15.1%. In many ways, it was an excellent test to Morgan Stanley and the opportunity to show the strength and stability of our business model. Let me just touch briefly on the turmoil and the banking sector. In my view, we are not in a banking crisis, but we have had and may still have a crisis among some banks. I believe strong regulatory intervention on both sides of the Atlantic led to the cauterization of the damage. I consider the current issues is not remotely comparable to 2008. I was pleased that Morgan Stanley, along with the other large U.S. banks, became part of the solution by providing an uninsured deposit line of $30 billion to First Republic Bank. Someone who lived through the darkest days of 2008 where Morgan Stanley was seen as part of the problem, it\u2019s indeed rewarding to be here 14 years later as part of the solution. Turning back to our own company, while the performance of the overall business was strong, the results reflected the impact of the environment. In Wealth Management, positive flows of $110 billion were a very strong result, reflect continued growth in the model together with the flight to quality. This obviously gives us a good start to our 1 trillion every 3 years target. Investment management also benefited from diversification as long-term outflows moderated and we saw strength in Parametric and also in the liquidity product. Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story. On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves. Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms. I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm\u2019s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels. In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings. The firm\u2019s first quarter efficiency ratio was 72%. Deferred cash-based compensation plans negatively impacted our firm\u2019s efficiency ratio by approximately 60 basis points. Ongoing technology and marketing and business development investments as well as higher litigation costs increased operational expenses versus the prior year. Given the broader market uncertainty and the inflationary environment, expense management remains a priority, although we continue to prioritize investments in our long-term goals. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion, an 11% decline from the very strong prior year. Fixed income and equity results partially offset weakness in banking as we helped our clients intermediate markets through this period of heightened uncertainty. From a regional perspective, Asia delivered its third highest quarter ever with strength in areas of both fixed income and equity aided by the policy dynamics in Japan and the China reopening. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.2 billion, solid revenue in advisory supported results while ongoing market volatility continued to pressure equity and non-investment grade underwriting. Advisory revenues were $638 million, benefiting from the completion of previously announced transactions. Revenues were down versus the strong prior year on the back of lower announced volumes in 2022. Equity underwriting revenues were $202 million, down 22%, largely as a result of depressed IPO activity. While IPO and follow-on activity remained muted, issuers selectively access market windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $407 million. Results were supported by an open investment grade market and opportunistic loan activity. Clients are engaged as we help them navigate an uncertain backdrop and our investment banking backlog is building. Financial sponsors continue to look for opportunities to invest. Within underwriting, we are encouraged by the issuance activity during constructive windows. Of course, further conversion from pipeline to realized is predicated on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, stable financing markets and increased corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $2.7 billion, a solid quarter against an uncertain and volatile backdrop. We continue to be a leader in this business and the results reflect our global and diversified footprint. Cash revenues decreased versus the prior first quarter on lower global volumes. Derivatives results were solid compared to a strong quarter last year as we help navigate \u2013 as we help clients navigate challenging markets. Prime brokerage revenues were down as equity market levels declined. Clients remained engaged and balances increased steadily throughout the quarter. Fixed income revenues of $2.6 billion were strong, though lower versus the prior year\u2019s elevated result, which was impacted by the beginning of the Fed rate hiking cycle and a start of the war in Ukraine. This quarter\u2019s performance was driven by rates and credit. Macro revenues were down modestly year-over-year with relative strength in rates versus foreign exchange in the comparison period. The volatility created by varying expectations around global central bank policy aided results across regions. Micro results were up versus the prior year, supported by client engagement. Commodity revenues moderated meaningfully compared to the robust results in the previous first quarter largely due to reduced volatility in European markets and the mild weather in the U.S. Other revenues of $245 million improved versus the prior year, largely driven by higher revenues on corporate lending activity and gains related to DCP. Turning to ISG lending and provisions, our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.3 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $189 million and net charge-offs were $70 million. The increase in provisions was driven by the higher recessionary probability and worsening outlook for commercial real estate. The charge-offs were substantially all from a handful of specific loans. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $6.6 billion. Movements in DCP positively impacted revenues by approximately $100 million compared to a negative impact of nearly $300 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. Net new asset growth of $110 billion was a standout as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.1%. The margin reflects a more favorable revenue mix offset by higher credit provisions and an increase in expenses as we continue to invest in our business, inclusive of integration-related expenses. Credit provisions were $78 million, including those that impacted revenue and the integration-related expenses for the quarter were $53 million, in line with our expectations. Forward growth drivers remain robust. Net new assets were very strong at $110 billion for the quarter, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the results illustrate our ability to attract assets and the payoff of our investments to support growth. We saw contribution from all channels with notable strength in the adviser led channel, particularly amongst existing clients. The events in March and the rising interest rate environment over the past year impacted client behavior. Clients increased their allocation to cash equivalents such as money market funds and U.S. treasuries by over 60% versus last year. At the same time, deposits declined in the quarter by 3% to $341 billion. We believe investable assets stayed within Morgan Stanley as our clients worked with advisers to help navigate the volatile markets. Today, adviser-led assets invested in cash and cash equivalents stand at a peak of 23% compared to historical average of approximately 18%. Over time, we believe clients will reinvest these balances across more assets when the market outlook improves. In the interim, given our broad product offerings, clients are choosing to invest in cash with Morgan Stanley through the cycle, positioning us to provide them with more reinvestment choices down the road. Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Results reflect the impact of higher interest rates and lower sweep balances. Fee-based flows of $22 billion were strong. Asset management revenues were $3.4 billion, down 7% versus last year, reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $921 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were down 12% versus last year due to fewer new issuance opportunities and reduced activity levels compared to the beginning of 2022. Lending balances declined this quarter to $144 billion, led by pay-downs in securities-based lending, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Importantly, our strategy is working and we are seeing channel migration from workplace to adviser-led. Adviser-led flows, originating from workplace relationships reached $28 billion in this quarter alone, double versus this time last year and this compares to the approximate $50 billion we saw annually over the past 3 years. Furthermore, almost 90% of these flows were from assets held away, also consistent with what we have seen historically. Our strategy remains in place to best serve our clients and support the firm\u2019s path to reach $10 trillion in client assets. Moving to Investment Management, revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year, primarily on lower AUM due to the decline of asset values and the cumulative effect of outflows over the prior year. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows were $2.4 billion as equity outflows moderated in the quarter. In fixed income, outflows in floating rate loans were partially offset by high yield and emerging markets. Finally, alternatives and solutions delivered strength, driven mostly by demand for Parametric\u2019s fixed income customized portfolios as well as inflows into private credit. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $13.9 billion. Positive liquidity inflows of $37 billion were partially offset by outflows related to a single client relationship. Asset management and related fees decreased versus the prior year to $1.2 billion due to lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue. Performance-based income and other revenues were $41 million. Results were supported by gains in our private alternatives portfolio, reflecting the diversity of the platform. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter in line with expectations. A key focus area remains maximizing our global distribution capabilities and we continue to see momentum internationally, particularly from the Eaton Vance fixed income team. Our investments across a broad array of strategies and capabilities, including active ETFs, Parametric customization and alternatives position us well to benefit from the diversification as well as to serve our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet, spot assets were $1.2 trillion, largely in line with the prior quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1% and SLR at 5.5%. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily on client activity, consistent with seasonal patterns. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, including buying back $1.5 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 19.3% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based award conversion takes place in the first quarter, creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. As James discussed, the fallout resulting from the events in March is not indicative of the systemic stress that the industry faced during the global financial crisis. Our clear and consistent strategy allowed us to enter this environment well positioned. The outlook for the remainder of this year is difficult to predict. We are keenly aware that opening and functioning markets and economic stability are integral in aiding confidence moving forward. In the interim, we remain focused on supporting our clients and attracting assets to our platform. With that, we will now open up the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take your first question from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Just thinking about the environment and the opportunity, can you talk about adviser recruitment, I assume retention is high, but as you think about the opportunity, given some of the fallout with some of the regional banks, in the current environment. Maybe talk about how you are positioned and maybe how that differentiates versus say a year ago?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. The adviser recruiting pipeline remains healthy. We continue to see assets aggregated from all channels, as I mentioned, both recruiting, adviser-led and workplace and when we compare it to a year ago, I think that what we continue to see is that we remain a destination of choice, not only for new advisers, but also obviously, as we stated, from the assets held away that we continue to aggregate in both the net new assets from existing and from new clients.\nDaniel Fannon: And then just as a follow-up, with NII, generally probably a little more challenged versus where we were last year, how do you think about wealth management margin expansion in this environment? And maybe specifically, can you talk to you the NII trends as you think about this year and how we should think about that given some of the deposit dynamics you mentioned as well as the current rate environment?\nSharon Yeshaya: So first, let\u2019s take NII. As we said, what we have been looking at is we thinking about it in terms of modeled client behavior. Obviously, March itself had a different modeled client behavior than we probably would have expected for other months within the quarter. But when we look ahead, we are currently not expecting expansion of the quarterly NII as we go forward. Now as that relates to the margin, a 26% margin, obviously, is still impacted by certain things, such as integration-related expenses. We mentioned also litigation and we continue to really invest in the model as we go \u2013 as we have and also as we go forward. All of that being said our eyes are still on the 30% goal that we have set forth and we will continue to achieve as we move through time to progress to those goals.\nOperator: We will hear next from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. Thanks. Maybe we could follow-up on that conversation. I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned that interesting stat of 23% sitting in cash and cash equivalents, up from 18% historically. If we weave that into normalizing over time, but also deposits were down 3% and cost of funds is up a bunch. As we go through the year, do you anticipate the normalization of the cash component at the same time, deposits continue to come down and migration continues to be yield seeking, like can \u2013 I guess, my question with all that ramble is, can the margin get back into that range while we have these cash leaking and yield-seeking behavior is happening?\nSharon Yeshaya: So I think that for us to predict exactly what the behavior will be. Obviously, if we think about what happened in March, that\u2019s a very difficult thing to predict. But I think what you\u2019re highlighting in your question, Glenn, as I parse out the very beginning of it, is right now, cash and cash equivalents are at a higher level, a higher level than we have ever seen historically. As we begin to see those assets be deployed into different types of products that ability and that advice will obviously be accretive. It will also help us as you see asset levels rise. So there is a pull/push factor as you think about those things. In addition to that, as we continue to aggregate assets, we will gain from scale, the more assets that we see, the more we will see in balances, the more that will probably help as you think about just what the cash balances are more broadly because assets are being attracted platform. And in addition to that, we will gain for the longer objectives of what that might mean for the margin and for the wealth management business more broadly.\nJames Gorman: If I could just add and excuse my voice, I have a chest cold. Glenn, on the simple math to take the margin of that business from 26% to 28% is about $120 million. Obviously, we\u2019re still absorbing some integration stuff relating to the platform that will be done this year. We had slightly higher reserves. We\u2019ve been investing pretty aggressively in the business and, frankly, I think, prudent \u2013 appropriately, the payoff is the $110 billion, which is a net new asset organic growth of 10%. So I\u2019ll take that any day long, the assets to sustain the building. So yes, we have a lot of levers to push that margin around a couple of percent points. That\u2019s not, frankly, a source of great anxiety to me at this point. And I think you\u2019ll see us probably push a few of those levers as we get through this year and certainly next year. So the trade-off is, I think we all want to keep investing for growth. We see a real window here. This $10 trillion target is for real. The tree in every 3 years is 300 \u2013 whatever it is, $330 million a year, $333 million, I guess. And starting off with $110 million, I think we have pretty good visibility to net new money. So it\u2019s a balance. But as we get through this integration as it\u2019s finally completed, some of those costs roll off. We will get a little tighter in the expense management in the wealth business. I know Andy and his team are already focused on that. So \u2013 and then the deposit stuff will \u2013 it\u2019s kind of going to be what it\u2019s going to be depending on where rates go and what the Fed does.\nGlenn Schorr: Appreciate that. And thank you for fixing my question. The follow-up I have a simpler on commercial real estate. Can you just help us just dimensionalize the portfolio? What exposure do you have? And how do we get comfortable that this is going to get that keeps on giving, like I\u2019m sure there is details within the provision that you took that could help us? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely. I think what\u2019s important about that portfolio is that it is diversified, in addition to that, we have been reducing the exposure in the ISG direct CRE portfolio over the course of the last year or so. So obviously, we keep our eyes on it. As you know, CECL is a life-of-loan concept. And so as you see economic deterioration, you do need to account for that. And the same goes for what we\u2019re seeing in the commercial real estate market. So I think that those are the two main points I would point you to is that it is diversified, and we have been continuing to reduce that direct exposure.\nOperator: We will hear next from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess just first question, I wanted to follow-up, James, a comment you made about being expecting 2023 to end on a constructive note. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that just in terms of a lot of this is tied to macro. How do you think the economy paying off in terms of the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation damage it does to the economy in the markets? And as you think about ending 2023, where do we think \u2013 where do you think we will be on all these fronts by the time the year ends?\nJames Gorman: Well, our house call out for the markets went about flat from where they started at the beginning of the year, and they certainly support that. I think the two wildcards out there are geopolitical risk, which we can\u2019t really handicap my gut is that the U.S.-China relations while having the moments tension remain overall stable through this year and global trade remains stable. The second risk, of course, is that the Fed\u2019s actions doesn\u2019t bring down inflation. Well, the evidence so far is it is bringing down inflation, but they are probably not done. I think it\u2019s likely we will see at least one more and possibly two more rate increases. That gets you to sort of high 5%, 6% type interest rates, which is not shocking. And if we get through that, again, many people are calling for a modest recession, it might be, I don\u2019t know, obviously, but got is, whether it\u2019s a modest recession or we dodged that bullet. Sort of doesn\u2019t matter that much. What really would matter is if inflation is not tamed, it has to go much higher than people are expecting. You go into a much deeper recession it\u2019s certainly not a likely outcome at this point. So that\u2019s why I said I think I used the words constructive. For Morgan Stanley, if the sort of green shoots we\u2019re starting to see. Again, I don\u2019t think they are a Q2-type event but back half of the year and next year in banking and underwriting, we just had a Global Risk Committee yesterday discussed some of the stuff and certainly the underwriting calendar, it looks like it\u2019s picking up a little bit through the back half of the year. I think the wealth management, what Sharon pointed to, the 23% in cash like security is moving into active investments, that will happen. I mean through the long history of this business people don\u2019t hold a quarter of their money in cash. They just think it is not real. So \u2013 and I suspect once we pass this sort of inflation Fed action, there will be a long pause would be my gut followed by some rate cuts starting in 2024. I do not expect that this year. So when I put it all together, relative to sort of other periods that I\u2019ve been through my career, I think it feels given the landlord, given the geopolitical stuff, given the inflation surge given COVID, it actually feels surprisingly benign from what it could have been. Now that\u2019s not denying there are clear stresses, the commercial real estate that I think Glenn just asked about across the banking sector, what\u2019s going on in some of those banks with very idiosyncratic portfolios that frankly didn\u2019t match duration interest rate risk, well, is were issues. There are parts of the world that are still having slow growth. So it\u2019s not a perfect kind of remains the rolling on song, you can\u2019t always get what you want but you get what you need. And I think about Morgan Stanley coming out of this, and we\u2019re kind of getting what we need. We\u2019re getting a 15% CET1. We\u2019re getting a 17% ROTCE decent revenue, decent earnings, obviously, opportunity to take some costs out and I think very well positioned on a go-forward basis. So that\u2019s where the word constructive came from. Sorry, it\u2019s a long answer for one word.\nEbrahim Poonawala: No. I appreciate the color. And just as a follow-up, when we think about capital return in terms of one, the pace of buybacks, given the macro uncertainty, any perspective there? And just opportunistically, do you see this as creating opportunities inorganically M&A-wise for Morgan Stanley as we look forward?\nJames Gorman: We\u2019ve maintained \u2013 it\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019ll deal with sort of what the capital position is now and what the opportunities are for excess capital. On the capital position now, CET1 is running at 15.1%. We obviously have control over that dial to a large extent. So \u2013 and we have tilted conservative. I think it\u2019s fair to say. I haven\u2019t seen all the numbers, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re at the top or above all of our competitors set again, and we\u2019ve been that way for quite a while. So on current capital requirements with the last stress test, we\u2019re at 13.2%, I think or 33%, somewhere around there. So 15% is a very healthy buffer. But we\u2019ve got a new stress test coming out. So many people feel that\u2019s going to be a little tougher than what it was last year. It might be, and we\u2019ve obviously got plenty of capital for it. So I don\u2019t expect any issues whatsoever. And then we have Basel III coming out in, I think, sort of late May, June time period where \u2013 and again, that will be implemented probably 2025 that looks like earliest. So again, there is time for the banks to adjust their capital position. So we will have much better visibility as to what we\u2019re dealing with by, say, July 1. And I \u2013 again, I don\u2019t \u2013 I suspect it might drive some changes in how we run our balance sheet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to involve anything particularly draconian. Now given that, we like to maintain a healthy buffer. We have done, obviously, the deals we did in the last couple of years, E-Trade and Eaton Vance, which I just said I couldn\u2019t be more happy with both the timing of those deals, the pricing of those deals and the performance of the businesses. And when we see a really robust market environment, you\u2019ll see that even more so in spades. We\u2019ve had a very healthy dividend yield. I think it\u2019s over 3.5% churn, something like that now. We believe in the dividend. I\u2019ve said for years, and I think of the wealth management business is a dividend stock, and we\u2019re clearly making more money in that business than we\u2019re paying out a dividend. And we\u2019re buying back. I mean we dove the buyback down a little bit. I think to $1.5 billion, we\u2019re probably running at $2.5 billion at our peak last year on a quarterly basis. And we did that just \u2013 it was an interesting environment. I mean, let\u2019s just say you had two of the biggest banks fail in the last 15 years. So being a little prudent a little conservative, watching that going on, you don\u2019t want to be too grabby is my attitude. So I think we have lots of flexibility. There is no doubt we can and over the years, we will do more acquisitions in my mind. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. And it will be in the wealth and asset management space and we constantly keep a list of who\u2019s attractive and who would be a good fit. But obviously, I couldn\u2019t say if there was something imminent, but there is nothing imminent, but it\u2019s something we focus on. So again, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m giving long answers this morning. It must be this cold that I\u2019ve got.\nOperator: We will move next to Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to start off just unpacking the NNA lows that you saw in the quarter. I mean 10% is really an impressive result. The fee-based flows continue to lag brokerage. And just wanted to better understand what you see as a sustainable fee-based flow rate. And just as we try to evaluate the durability of 10%, how much of the quarterly inflows were from FRC where you\u2019re clearly a destination of choice for some of those attriting advisers?\nSharon Yeshaya: I\u2019m going to try and remember all of your questions, Steve, in order. So if I forget one, just remind me. The first point on FRC, I\u2019ll take first. In terms of the regionals, more broadly, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I believe we had about $90 billion that came in without any relationship to those regionals. And so that shows cases to you that\u2019s well above the average that we\u2019ve seen. So I think it just continues to show that the investments that we have made are really working as we move forward. So that\u2019s sort of point number one. The second point that I mentioned, and I think you asked where are those assets coming from? It\u2019s really \u2013 in this particular quarter was in that adviser-led space both from existing accounts and new clients. To me, what was most remarkable when I was going through the diligence materials really was what we\u2019re seeing from clients. So the idea that we continue to be a destination of choice for our existing clients and attracting assets held away, again, speak to all the conversations that we\u2019ve all had over the course of the last 7 years or so talking about investments to give our advisers more time to service their clients as we move forward. Then the final question that you asked around the fee-based flows actually a very strong fee-based flow number, to be honest, from our perspective in an environment where individuals \u2013 we think about it, cash and cash equivalents are high. You\u2019re thinking about putting your money into managed kind of accounts associated with it from that fee-based concept, you\u2019re unlikely to do that in a period of time where you think the cash and cash equivalents and safety might be what you\u2019re looking for right now. And so that is, in fact, the dry powder that we have that over time could move into the fee-based assets. So I think it\u2019s actually a strong number given the environment that we have on the backdrop.\nSteven Chubak: Really helpful color, Sharon. And just for my follow-up, with \u2013 on sweep deposits, those are now running below 4% of AUM. That\u2019s historically been a strong support level for transactional cash within the advisory space broadly. I was hoping you can give some perspective on how we could think about where sweep CAT could potentially bottom and have you seen any continued mix shift into sweep or deposit pressures in April so far?\nSharon Yeshaya: As it relates to April, I talked a little bit in one of the earlier questions about modeled client behavior. And that what we did see is that in March, we really deviated from some of that modeled client behavior. Now in April, we have been more in line with modeled client behavior. So that does speak to your point of maybe we are in a position where from a transactional patch level, we are there. But again, as James said, it is an uncertain environment. And so from that perspective, we will have to wait and see how we move through time from here.\nOperator: Moving next to Brennan Hawken from UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019d actually have to follow-up on that last question from Steven. So April is more modeled April is typically a tax payment month, which is a headwind. So are you seeing \u2013 where is that cash getting funded from? Are you seeing some of the taxes \u2013 tax payments coming out of both sweep and the other higher cost deposit sources? Is it more biased to the higher cost? Could that provide some relief? And when we put all that into the mix and think about NII going forward, should we be thinking about stable NII we know it\u2019s not growing, but funding this funding cost elevation maybe could lead to some downside. So curious how we should be thinking about that.\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that your question in terms of April in terms of where it\u2019s coming from the exact breakdown is challenging to see in terms of exactly where it\u2019s coming from, from all of the deposits perspective because there is could, as you know, cash is fungible, so you could take something and then move it into a different security or a different asset. To parse that out, is challenging. I do think that what\u2019s more important, as you highlight, is that it is tax season. And so to not see an acceleration is obviously one of the more optimistic signs that you are moving through more model client behavior. Now what it means from funding, we obviously have many funding different places. I don\u2019t think that funding is concern, as you mentioned, it does matter from an NII perspective, but it will be a function of two things, Brennan. As you know, rate expectations have also changed since January. And so our NII forecast and predictions are based on models client behavior in terms of cash, sweep etcetera, and also where interest rates are and where the forward curve is for Fed bonds. And so as you begin to see if that changes, that could change your NII forecast. We are still, if you look at models client behavior, asset sensitive. And so from that perspective, I think that gives you a few different pieces to put together in terms of how to think about the forward look based on deferred assumptions.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks very much. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty, so I appreciate that color. And then one more on the net new asset component. Sharon, you guys have an offer for \u2013 promotional offer and it\u2019s tied to higher yielding cash alternatives. What percentage of the net new assets came into \u2013 from that promotion this quarter? In the past, you\u2019ve spoken about how when you bring that cash in a majority of it stays in the system. Do you have any more granular statistics on what portion of that stays in the system? It\u2019s obviously good that it comes into the system, but kind of curious when we think about stickiness and how much is hot money and how much is actually durable? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: So the best way to think about the stickiness within the system is actually NNA right, because you\u2019re going to see the outflows would be a net negative to the NNA more broadly. And so the consistent growth over time, if you look at it all the way back even to when we saw promotional levels back, I remember we spoke about this in \u201818 and I think it was \u201817 and \u201818. In those early years, that was still seeing net new asset inflows over time. So, for me, the most important thing is, well, what\u2019s the net, the net continues to be positive and continues to ramp higher. In terms of the CD exact offerings and what that would mean from NNA, it\u2019s considered NNA if it\u2019s brought out from outside of the firm. And again, what\u2019s important here is that we continue to see more in the advisor-led space. And that over time, again, think about the channel migration from workplace into the advisor-led space. What\u2019s important here is that when people begin to seed money into advisor-led, we actually see more money from assets held away. So, I know that doesn\u2019t answer your question directly, but I think it\u2019s important to highlight, as people begin to work with an advisor, what we said to you is 90% of the assets that then come are from assets held away outside the building. So, just again, another proof point that once they understand what the advisor has to offer, it helps aggregate new assets into our system.\nOperator: We will hear next from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, can you share with us, when you guys talked about, I think James said around 25% of your Wealth Management customers\u2019 assets are in cash or cash equivalents, which is high, of course. What interest rate do you guys sense, meaning do rates at the fall 100 basis points or 200 basis points for that money to move back into more traditional assets?\nSharon Yeshaya: So, I don\u2019t actually know that it\u2019s the absolute value \u2013 the rate level. And I will answer it in two different ways. First, you have to remember that the events in March didn\u2019t make people \u2013 I mean, we all read the popular press and most individuals begin to think about what is the most risk-free asset, that being a U.S. treasuries. So, one should not be surprised if they begin to move assets into U.S. treasuries. So, I do think that it\u2019s a function also of uncertainty and not just the absolute level of where interest rates are or aren\u2019t. Now, as I have said, we have these moments that are opportunistic, both when you think about the corporate activity and then when you think about the individual activities, so both for ISG and in Wealth Management. And that was evidenced last August, last October and then earlier in January and February that when markets become calm that you begin to see movements into asset classes and further activity as evidenced by our self-directed channel as well. So, I don\u2019t know that there is an absolute level of rates, but I would say it\u2019s related to confidence in the system more broadly and a belief in asset levels being in a place that will bottom and then potentially will rise as we go forward.\nJames Gorman: I totally agree with that. I think Gerard, if people can get a 4%-ish return in a very uncertain environment, that\u2019s not a bad thing to have in your portfolio, at least for 25% of their portfolio. As they get better visibility, as we all get better visibility of when the Fed stops moving and did we go into this recession that some appearing or not or if it\u2019s modest, then I think you will start seeing more engagement. I mean it\u2019s just, we have all been through this. It\u2019s human behavior. We have had a pretty significant shock to the system in the last few months, which thankfully the world kind of \u2013 the financial world got through, but could have turned sideways. And higher rates came at a time of increased uncertainty. So, it\u2019s entirely rational that people would take advantage of higher rates and increased uncertainty by parking in cash, but they are not going to stay in cash at 4% forever. That\u2019s not going to help.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up question, Sharon, you talked about the credit, the provision and linking into commercial real estate. Of the total loan portfolio, what percentage of that is in commercial real estate mortgages? And are there any construction loans in that portfolio?\nSharon Yeshaya: As it relates specifically to the construction loans, I don\u2019t know about the exact construction loans that you might have. I am certain that somewhere there could be a construction loan. But more broadly, I think the absolute level, we do disclose from the ISG side around that $10 billion, and that was in our filings from last quarter.\nOperator: Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Thank you. Good morning. I just want to start just on market share opportunities that maybe are accelerating here. You touched on some on the call, but one of your peers highlighted your private banking in Europe, just on the heels of some of the banking stress or potentially even just opportunities where you are going to get paid more for committing capital when your capital is becoming more scarce in the system. So, just love to maybe think about some of the things that you are seeing just over the last month or so that might be sustained going forward.\nSharon Yeshaya: On capital opportunities, in Europe. Sorry, could you repeat what\u2019s the question?\nDevin Ryan: Yes. The question is just where there is opportunities to take market share kind of in the wake of the banking turmoil. So, one peer had highlighted private banking in Europe as one example. But just whether there is others as well here, just on the heels of the recent stress?\nJames Gorman: Yes. Devin, let me have a go at that because that probably builds off the capital discussion and where we would invest. We do not have an appetite for private banking in Europe. In fact, we sold our Private Bank in Europe to Credit Suisse several years ago. It\u2019s one of the first things I did, because we would had an unhappy experience. We had owned the business for 21 years, and we lost money for 20 years of them. And I kind of took a fairly simple view that if you lose 20 years out of 21 years, you have probably got to lose it. So, we got out, you need scale. And frankly, it\u2019s not a good fit I believe, with the current regulatory structure that we operate under, so much more interested in the U.S. and Asia and some in Lat-Am. The U.S. business, it\u2019s just going to be an asset gathering monster. To bring in $110 billion in one quarter and $1 trillion over the last 3 years, there aren\u2019t many companies in the world that have a trillion assets under management. So, I think we have got to keep our eye on the prize here and not get distracted by going down some rabbit hole because somebody else is in stress, maybe somebody else is in stress because it\u2019s not a very attractive rabbit hole when you get down inside it. We know what we have got here, and it\u2019s a killer machine. Asia is growing nicely. Again, Lat-Am some, but the workplace conversion is a massive opportunity now that we are focused on. Obviously, we are tracking financial advisors from seeing somewhat of a safe harbor, I guess across the industry. In our organic flows, if you compare them to our traditional competitors, the warehouses or the online brokers, our organic flows, I think are on an annualized basis, significantly higher than the traditional players, and higher than anybody in the industry. So, that\u2019s how we think about it, again, Asia more interesting, Europe not interesting, Lat-Am a little bit interesting and U.S. definitely interesting.\nDevin Ryan: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Helpful. Just a follow-up, it sounds like you are starting to see maybe a little bit better momentum with financial sponsor clients. I would love to maybe just touch on those specifically and kind of what the appetite is to do deals or to sell assets and kind of what the \u2013 you think the trigger point is to kind of engage them further?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly, I mentioned is actually when I spoke at a February conference this year, which is that when you think about financial sponsors, they may be in a different position than what we would consider traditional M&A, i.e., they are faster to market. They are in a position where you might not have the same level of activity from a Board. And because of the size, you might have different regulatory restrictions. And so from that perspective, we would expect that they might be first before we see really traditional activity open up. And that is \u2013 that remains kind of the view that we have and also as the pipeline begins to build, that\u2019s also what we are seeing. In order for that to move forward and become realized, it\u2019s really about the opening of the markets in terms of the financing activity. As we have seen some of the backlogs clear, that\u2019s clearly very helpful. But again, it\u2019s about stabilization and it\u2019s about confidence.\nOperator: We will move next to Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. What is going so right \u2013 what is going so right in Asia that it\u2019s your third best quarter in an environment like this? And then what is going so wrong in investment management since you closed Eaton Vance, the first full quarter, it was second quarter \u201821, if I have that correctly. Investment management revenues are down almost one-fourth. So, shout out to certainly E*TRADE and wealth doing well. But in terms of investment management, like it just looks from the outside like Eaton Vance panning out the way you expected. But first, the positive on the Asia was going right and then the negative one, what\u2019s not going right in the investment management?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. So, let\u2019s take Asia first. What we saw over the course of the quarter was China reopening, obviously, supporting us from the equities side and perspective in terms of client engagement. And what\u2019s going right also from Asia has been the \u2013 what we have a franchise that we have really built in Japan. And in an environment where interest rate dynamics change, such as what\u2019s going on within Japan, that certainly helped us from the macro perspective and the macro business within fixed income. So, I think that we are \u2013 that\u2019s very important and critical is that it speaks to the global perspective, and it speaks to our global franchise. Why that is important when you think about investment management, and I will tie the two together is that you have to invest more broadly to be able to create an environment of diversification. And so Asia might be asleep. Japan, for example, could be asleep for many years, and all of a sudden, Central Bank activity picks up, and you are there to support your clients with that global franchise. Think about investment management quite similarly. What we are doing is we continue to build a franchise where we are able to have diversified products that are there to capture our client assets. You highlighted what\u2019s going on within the investment management. Well, asset levels are down tremendously. However, since we have purchased and we announced the deal associated with Eaton Vance. Look at Parametric, we have raised over $45 billion in that product alone, again, diversification of the portfolio, diversification of product to be there in a period of time where you see activity. That\u2019s what we are trying to do and build.\nJames Gorman: Yes. I mean I will just add, I wouldn\u2019t frankly, render a judgment yet on the Eaton Vance deal. I think it\u2019s a little soon through a challenging market environment. I would tell you, I am personally thrilled with it. And I am highly confident that 5 years from now, we are going to look back and be thrilled with a lot of people said that Smith Barney deal was a dumb idea. And a lot of people said, E*TRADE is a dumb idea. And a lot of people said we overpaid for Solium and these things have moments of sort of settling, if you will. It\u2019s like good house its foundations have to settle. And in a very challenging environment, I think the business is holding up, right. So, I am very happy with that transaction, great people, great company, some fabulous brands. And I think Mike, if you come back and ask that questions in 3 years\u2019 time, hopefully, you won\u2019t reverse the questions. But maybe you will say what\u2019s going right with Eaton Vance and asset management, and what\u2019s going wrong in some other places. Because I am sure, as I have said in the rolling sense, you can\u2019t always get what you want, given the environment, something might be working. But yes, I am pretty relaxed about that one.\nMike Mayo: I appreciate the answer. Just a short follow-up, it looks like you are not getting any NII guide, or if you did, I have missed it, and we just want some help with our models here. If you want to kind of guide us in a certain direction, I mean clearly, funding costs have gone up in the industry.\nJames Gorman: I mean super hard. I will be blunt. We sort of guided a little higher on growth in the first quarter and came in plus 1%, which I guess was better than most, but just super hard. So, let\u2019s get through \u2013 I think let\u2019s get through this quarter. We will learn a lot of taxes. And as Sharon said, it\u2019s kind of the numbers have reverted back to what we are modeling, which is good. We will see that. We will see how much of this cash that\u2019s moving. We will see whether there is further deposit outflows or not. I mean it\u2019s just super hard to guide right now. So, I don\u2019t think I know it\u2019s sort of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair or not, but it makes your modeling harder, which I appreciate. But also I don\u2019t want to give guidance that we don\u2019t really have an intellectual basis or fact basis for doing it. It\u2019s just too hard. We are not stressed about it, but that much guidance I will give you, but I just don\u2019t want to put numbers on the sheet of paper at this point.\nOperator: We will move next to Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about the sustainability of the strong fixed income trading revenues. Obviously, on an absolute basis, very good, down from a really strong year ago level and benefited from rate volatility, but at the same time, advisory and DCM was sluggish. So, how do you think about this kind of not just 2Q, but the next several quarters in the kind of environment that we are in and maybe some improvement in IB? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: So, the \u2013 our business has done. I think management has done a phenomenal job in really transforming this business to be a client-centric model focused on velocity of assets, focused on supporting our clients. So, the deeper we have gotten into that, the more we have been able to grow our wallet share more broadly and we have been able to be in and around this 10% number. So, that\u2019s clearly based on the activity that we have seen. Now to your point, should we see an opening up of markets could there be greater activity, that would also obviously support the wallet more broadly, but we would expect to be there to continue to gain our appropriate share of that client activity.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then maybe just broadly speaking, like as you think about client brokerage in both fix and equity, like what\u2019s your thought there in terms of committing capital kind of on an incremental basis, like providing more or less from here or not really any change?\nSharon Yeshaya: We continued to invest in that business more broadly. You can see that even on the technology side. We are really proud of the equity franchise and business and the transformation that\u2019s had for well over a decade being a market leader. Clearly, as we think about committing capital, it\u2019s also, again, about our clients being active in that market as we see. And I highlighted this in my prepared remarks, we do see client balances increase. We have obviously been there to support our clients. And we are looking for the appropriate risk-adjusted return as we continue to invest in that business.\nJames Gorman: Yes. I would just add, if you step back from this sort of over a 5-year view, firstly, just take hats off to the team led by Ted and Sam, Kelley Smith and then Jay Hallik and Jack [ph] in fixed income. It\u2019s come a long way from, I think a 6% share. I think we troughed that. I don\u2019t even know below after crisis might have been much lower, but sort of 6%-ish share per half of the last decade, and then steadily moved up to 10% and pretty stable. It\u2019s kind of what we wanted. I mean \u2013 and on the equity side, you can buy share, for sure, more, but you want to be in the part of the prime brokerage business that we want to be in. We don\u2019t want to be in the sort of the broker last resort. So \u2013 but if you step back from it and what you have really got is kind of an oligopoly type structure emerged out of the financial crisis where a smaller number of institutions have the global capability for global sales and trading, and we are now one of them. And that was probably not a given 10 years ago. It certainly wasn\u2019t a given. And you have just seen, obviously, Credit Suisse has been merged and that business, lots of parts of that business. I suspect this appear relating to the trading side of the prime brokerage. So, our position gets stronger, not weaker. All that said, we are pretty careful about how much balance sheet we want to use to grow aggressively on the margin because we simply have good options in terms of wealth and asset management businesses. So, it\u2019s a balancing act, but I think the team has done a great job, and I feel really good about where they landed the plane this quarter. tricky quarter, by the way, particularly in rates.\nOperator: We will hear next from Jeremy Sigee from BNP.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. Just quite a specific one actually. I thought comp costs were a bit heavy in wealth and in investment management. And you mentioned the deferred comp plans linked to investment performance. Is that heavier deferred comp cost? Is that something that stays with us throughout the year, or is it \u2013 does it move around? Is that a 1Q specific, or is that stuck with us for the rest of the year as well?\nSharon Yeshaya: Jeremy, as you remember, that moves around with the investments. You will see both on the revenue line and the expense line. And so you should look at them together, and that\u2019s why we have enhanced the disclosure so that you can think about them from both sides, understand both the margin and the comp ratio, both historically and as we move forward.\nJeremy Sigee: That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Gorman",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The first quarter of 2023 was very eventful for our industry, but not so eventful for Morgan Stanley. Firm delivered strong results with revenues of over $14.5 billion, net income of $3 billion, ROTCE of 17% and net new asset flows of $110 billion. At the same time, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock while maintaining a CET ratio of 15.1%. In many ways, it was an excellent test to Morgan Stanley and the opportunity to show the strength and stability of our business model. Let me just touch briefly on the turmoil and the banking sector. In my view, we are not in a banking crisis, but we have had and may still have a crisis among some banks. I believe strong regulatory intervention on both sides of the Atlantic led to the cauterization of the damage. I consider the current issues is not remotely comparable to 2008. I was pleased that Morgan Stanley, along with the other large U.S. banks, became part of the solution by providing an uninsured deposit line of $30 billion to First Republic Bank. Someone who lived through the darkest days of 2008 where Morgan Stanley was seen as part of the problem, it's indeed rewarding to be here 14 years later as part of the solution. Turning back to our own company, while the performance of the overall business was strong, the results reflected the impact of the environment. In Wealth Management, positive flows of $110 billion were a very strong result, reflect continued growth in the model together with the flight to quality. This obviously gives us a good start to our 1 trillion every 3 years target. Investment management also benefited from diversification as long-term outflows moderated and we saw strength in Parametric and also in the liquidity product. Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story. On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves. Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms. I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. If I could just add and excuse my voice, I have a chest cold. Glenn, on the simple math to take the margin of that business from 26% to 28% is about $120 million. Obviously, we're still absorbing some integration stuff relating to the platform that will be done this year. We had slightly higher reserves. We've been investing pretty aggressively in the business and, frankly, I think, prudent \u2013 appropriately, the payoff is the $110 billion, which is a net new asset organic growth of 10%. So I'll take that any day long, the assets to sustain the building. So yes, we have a lot of levers to push that margin around a couple of percent points. That's not, frankly, a source of great anxiety to me at this point. And I think you'll see us probably push a few of those levers as we get through this year and certainly next year. So the trade-off is, I think we all want to keep investing for growth. We see a real window here. This $10 trillion target is for real. The tree in every 3 years is 300 \u2013 whatever it is, $330 million a year, $333 million, I guess. And starting off with $110 million, I think we have pretty good visibility to net new money. So it's a balance. But as we get through this integration as it's finally completed, some of those costs roll off. We will get a little tighter in the expense management in the wealth business. I know Andy and his team are already focused on that. So \u2013 and then the deposit stuff will \u2013 it's kind of going to be what it's going to be depending on where rates go and what the Fed does. Well, our house call out for the markets went about flat from where they started at the beginning of the year, and they certainly support that. I think the two wildcards out there are geopolitical risk, which we can't really handicap my gut is that the U.S.-China relations while having the moments tension remain overall stable through this year and global trade remains stable. The second risk, of course, is that the Fed's actions doesn't bring down inflation. Well, the evidence so far is it is bringing down inflation, but they are probably not done. I think it's likely we will see at least one more and possibly two more rate increases. That gets you to sort of high 5%, 6% type interest rates, which is not shocking. And if we get through that, again, many people are calling for a modest recession, it might be, I don't know, obviously, but got is, whether it's a modest recession or we dodged that bullet. Sort of doesn't matter that much. What really would matter is if inflation is not tamed, it has to go much higher than people are expecting. You go into a much deeper recession it's certainly not a likely outcome at this point. So that's why I said I think I used the words constructive. For Morgan Stanley, if the sort of green shoots we're starting to see. Again, I don't think they are a Q2-type event but back half of the year and next year in banking and underwriting, we just had a Global Risk Committee yesterday discussed some of the stuff and certainly the underwriting calendar, it looks like it's picking up a little bit through the back half of the year. I think the wealth management, what Sharon pointed to, the 23% in cash like security is moving into active investments, that will happen. I mean through the long history of this business people don't hold a quarter of their money in cash. They just think it is not real. So \u2013 and I suspect once we pass this sort of inflation Fed action, there will be a long pause would be my gut followed by some rate cuts starting in 2024. I do not expect that this year. So when I put it all together, relative to sort of other periods that I've been through my career, I think it feels given the landlord, given the geopolitical stuff, given the inflation surge given COVID, it actually feels surprisingly benign from what it could have been. Now that's not denying there are clear stresses, the commercial real estate that I think Glenn just asked about across the banking sector, what's going on in some of those banks with very idiosyncratic portfolios that frankly didn't match duration interest rate risk, well, is were issues. There are parts of the world that are still having slow growth. So it's not a perfect kind of remains the rolling on song, you can't always get what you want but you get what you need. And I think about Morgan Stanley coming out of this, and we're kind of getting what we need. We're getting a 15% CET1. We're getting a 17% ROTCE decent revenue, decent earnings, obviously, opportunity to take some costs out and I think very well positioned on a go-forward basis. So that's where the word constructive came from. Sorry, it's a long answer for one word. We've maintained \u2013 it's a very good question. I'll deal with sort of what the capital position is now and what the opportunities are for excess capital. On the capital position now, CET1 is running at 15.1%. We obviously have control over that dial to a large extent. So \u2013 and we have tilted conservative. I think it's fair to say. I haven't seen all the numbers, but I'm pretty sure we're at the top or above all of our competitors set again, and we've been that way for quite a while. So on current capital requirements with the last stress test, we're at 13.2%, I think or 33%, somewhere around there. So 15% is a very healthy buffer. But we've got a new stress test coming out. So many people feel that's going to be a little tougher than what it was last year. It might be, and we've obviously got plenty of capital for it. So I don't expect any issues whatsoever. And then we have Basel III coming out in, I think, sort of late May, June time period where \u2013 and again, that will be implemented probably 2025 that looks like earliest. So again, there is time for the banks to adjust their capital position. So we will have much better visibility as to what we're dealing with by, say, July 1. And I \u2013 again, I don't \u2013 I suspect it might drive some changes in how we run our balance sheet, but I don't think it's going to involve anything particularly draconian. Now given that, we like to maintain a healthy buffer. We have done, obviously, the deals we did in the last couple of years, E-Trade and Eaton Vance, which I just said I couldn't be more happy with both the timing of those deals, the pricing of those deals and the performance of the businesses. And when we see a really robust market environment, you'll see that even more so in spades. We've had a very healthy dividend yield. I think it's over 3.5% churn, something like that now. We believe in the dividend. I've said for years, and I think of the wealth management business is a dividend stock, and we're clearly making more money in that business than we're paying out a dividend. And we're buying back. I mean we dove the buyback down a little bit. I think to $1.5 billion, we're probably running at $2.5 billion at our peak last year on a quarterly basis. And we did that just \u2013 it was an interesting environment. I mean, let's just say you had two of the biggest banks fail in the last 15 years. So being a little prudent a little conservative, watching that going on, you don't want to be too grabby is my attitude. So I think we have lots of flexibility. There is no doubt we can and over the years, we will do more acquisitions in my mind. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. And it will be in the wealth and asset management space and we constantly keep a list of who's attractive and who would be a good fit. But obviously, I couldn't say if there was something imminent, but there is nothing imminent, but it's something we focus on. So again, I'm sorry, I'm giving long answers this morning. It must be this cold that I've got. I totally agree with that. I think Gerard, if people can get a 4%-ish return in a very uncertain environment, that's not a bad thing to have in your portfolio, at least for 25% of their portfolio. As they get better visibility, as we all get better visibility of when the Fed stops moving and did we go into this recession that some appearing or not or if it's modest, then I think you will start seeing more engagement. I mean it's just, we have all been through this. It's human behavior. We have had a pretty significant shock to the system in the last few months, which thankfully the world kind of \u2013 the financial world got through, but could have turned sideways. And higher rates came at a time of increased uncertainty. So, it's entirely rational that people would take advantage of higher rates and increased uncertainty by parking in cash, but they are not going to stay in cash at 4% forever. That's not going to help. Yes. Devin, let me have a go at that because that probably builds off the capital discussion and where we would invest. We do not have an appetite for private banking in Europe. In fact, we sold our Private Bank in Europe to Credit Suisse several years ago. It's one of the first things I did, because we would had an unhappy experience. We had owned the business for 21 years, and we lost money for 20 years of them. And I kind of took a fairly simple view that if you lose 20 years out of 21 years, you have probably got to lose it. So, we got out, you need scale. And frankly, it's not a good fit I believe, with the current regulatory structure that we operate under, so much more interested in the U.S. and Asia and some in Lat-Am. The U.S. business, it's just going to be an asset gathering monster. To bring in $110 billion in one quarter and $1 trillion over the last 3 years, there aren't many companies in the world that have a trillion assets under management. So, I think we have got to keep our eye on the prize here and not get distracted by going down some rabbit hole because somebody else is in stress, maybe somebody else is in stress because it's not a very attractive rabbit hole when you get down inside it. We know what we have got here, and it's a killer machine. Asia is growing nicely. Again, Lat-Am some, but the workplace conversion is a massive opportunity now that we are focused on. Obviously, we are tracking financial advisors from seeing somewhat of a safe harbor, I guess across the industry. In our organic flows, if you compare them to our traditional competitors, the warehouses or the online brokers, our organic flows, I think are on an annualized basis, significantly higher than the traditional players, and higher than anybody in the industry. So, that's how we think about it, again, Asia more interesting, Europe not interesting, Lat-Am a little bit interesting and U.S. definitely interesting. Yes. I mean I will just add, I wouldn't frankly, render a judgment yet on the Eaton Vance deal. I think it's a little soon through a challenging market environment. I would tell you, I am personally thrilled with it. And I am highly confident that 5 years from now, we are going to look back and be thrilled with a lot of people said that Smith Barney deal was a dumb idea. And a lot of people said, E*TRADE is a dumb idea. And a lot of people said we overpaid for Solium and these things have moments of sort of settling, if you will. It's like good house its foundations have to settle. And in a very challenging environment, I think the business is holding up, right. So, I am very happy with that transaction, great people, great company, some fabulous brands. And I think Mike, if you come back and ask that questions in 3 years' time, hopefully, you won't reverse the questions. But maybe you will say what's going right with Eaton Vance and asset management, and what's going wrong in some other places. Because I am sure, as I have said in the rolling sense, you can't always get what you want, given the environment, something might be working. But yes, I am pretty relaxed about that one. I mean super hard. I will be blunt. We sort of guided a little higher on growth in the first quarter and came in plus 1%, which I guess was better than most, but just super hard. So, let's get through \u2013 I think let's get through this quarter. We will learn a lot of taxes. And as Sharon said, it's kind of the numbers have reverted back to what we are modeling, which is good. We will see that. We will see how much of this cash that's moving. We will see whether there is further deposit outflows or not. I mean it's just super hard to guide right now. So, I don't think I know it's sort of \u2013 I don't know if it's fair or not, but it makes your modeling harder, which I appreciate. But also I don't want to give guidance that we don't really have an intellectual basis or fact basis for doing it. It's just too hard. We are not stressed about it, but that much guidance I will give you, but I just don't want to put numbers on the sheet of paper at this point. Yes. I would just add, if you step back from this sort of over a 5-year view, firstly, just take hats off to the team led by Ted and Sam, Kelley Smith and then Jay Hallik and Jack [ph] in fixed income. It's come a long way from, I think a 6% share. I think we troughed that. I don't even know below after crisis might have been much lower, but sort of 6%-ish share per half of the last decade, and then steadily moved up to 10% and pretty stable. It's kind of what we wanted. I mean \u2013 and on the equity side, you can buy share, for sure, more, but you want to be in the part of the prime brokerage business that we want to be in. We don't want to be in the sort of the broker last resort. So \u2013 but if you step back from it and what you have really got is kind of an oligopoly type structure emerged out of the financial crisis where a smaller number of institutions have the global capability for global sales and trading, and we are now one of them. And that was probably not a given 10 years ago. It certainly wasn't a given. And you have just seen, obviously, Credit Suisse has been merged and that business, lots of parts of that business. I suspect this appear relating to the trading side of the prime brokerage. So, our position gets stronger, not weaker. All that said, we are pretty careful about how much balance sheet we want to use to grow aggressively on the margin because we simply have good options in terms of wealth and asset management businesses. So, it's a balancing act, but I think the team has done a great job, and I feel really good about where they landed the plane this quarter. tricky quarter, by the way, particularly in rates."

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm's results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels. In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 72%. Deferred cash-based compensation plans negatively impacted our firm's efficiency ratio by approximately 60 basis points. Ongoing technology and marketing and business development investments as well as higher litigation costs increased operational expenses versus the prior year. Given the broader market uncertainty and the inflationary environment, expense management remains a priority, although we continue to prioritize investments in our long-term goals. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion, an 11% decline from the very strong prior year. Fixed income and equity results partially offset weakness in banking as we helped our clients intermediate markets through this period of heightened uncertainty. From a regional perspective, Asia delivered its third highest quarter ever with strength in areas of both fixed income and equity aided by the policy dynamics in Japan and the China reopening. Investment Banking revenues decreased year-over-year to $1.2 billion, solid revenue in advisory supported results while ongoing market volatility continued to pressure equity and non-investment grade underwriting. Advisory revenues were $638 million, benefiting from the completion of previously announced transactions. Revenues were down versus the strong prior year on the back of lower announced volumes in 2022. Equity underwriting revenues were $202 million, down 22%, largely as a result of depressed IPO activity. While IPO and follow-on activity remained muted, issuers selectively access market windows. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $407 million. Results were supported by an open investment grade market and opportunistic loan activity. Clients are engaged as we help them navigate an uncertain backdrop and our investment banking backlog is building. Financial sponsors continue to look for opportunities to invest. Within underwriting, we are encouraged by the issuance activity during constructive windows. Of course, further conversion from pipeline to realized is predicated on clarity around macroeconomic conditions, stable financing markets and increased corporate confidence. Equity revenues were $2.7 billion, a solid quarter against an uncertain and volatile backdrop. We continue to be a leader in this business and the results reflect our global and diversified footprint. Cash revenues decreased versus the prior first quarter on lower global volumes. Derivatives results were solid compared to a strong quarter last year as we help navigate \u2013 as we help clients navigate challenging markets. Prime brokerage revenues were down as equity market levels declined. Clients remained engaged and balances increased steadily throughout the quarter. Fixed income revenues of $2.6 billion were strong, though lower versus the prior year's elevated result, which was impacted by the beginning of the Fed rate hiking cycle and a start of the war in Ukraine. This quarter's performance was driven by rates and credit. Macro revenues were down modestly year-over-year with relative strength in rates versus foreign exchange in the comparison period. The volatility created by varying expectations around global central bank policy aided results across regions. Micro results were up versus the prior year, supported by client engagement. Commodity revenues moderated meaningfully compared to the robust results in the previous first quarter largely due to reduced volatility in European markets and the mild weather in the U.S. Other revenues of $245 million improved versus the prior year, largely driven by higher revenues on corporate lending activity and gains related to DCP. Turning to ISG lending and provisions, our allowance for credit losses on ISG loans and lending commitments increased to $1.3 billion. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $189 million and net charge-offs were $70 million. The increase in provisions was driven by the higher recessionary probability and worsening outlook for commercial real estate. The charge-offs were substantially all from a handful of specific loans. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $6.6 billion. Movements in DCP positively impacted revenues by approximately $100 million compared to a negative impact of nearly $300 million in last year's first quarter. Net new asset growth of $110 billion was a standout as we continue to execute on our long-term strategy. Pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion and the PBT margin was 26.1%. The margin reflects a more favorable revenue mix offset by higher credit provisions and an increase in expenses as we continue to invest in our business, inclusive of integration-related expenses. Credit provisions were $78 million, including those that impacted revenue and the integration-related expenses for the quarter were $53 million, in line with our expectations. Forward growth drivers remain robust. Net new assets were very strong at $110 billion for the quarter, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets. While NNA will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the results illustrate our ability to attract assets and the payoff of our investments to support growth. We saw contribution from all channels with notable strength in the adviser led channel, particularly amongst existing clients. The events in March and the rising interest rate environment over the past year impacted client behavior. Clients increased their allocation to cash equivalents such as money market funds and U.S. treasuries by over 60% versus last year. At the same time, deposits declined in the quarter by 3% to $341 billion. We believe investable assets stayed within Morgan Stanley as our clients worked with advisers to help navigate the volatile markets. Today, adviser-led assets invested in cash and cash equivalents stand at a peak of 23% compared to historical average of approximately 18%. Over time, we believe clients will reinvest these balances across more assets when the market outlook improves. In the interim, given our broad product offerings, clients are choosing to invest in cash with Morgan Stanley through the cycle, positioning us to provide them with more reinvestment choices down the road. Net interest income was $2.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Results reflect the impact of higher interest rates and lower sweep balances. Fee-based flows of $22 billion were strong. Asset management revenues were $3.4 billion, down 7% versus last year, reflecting lower market levels. Transactional revenues were $921 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues were down 12% versus last year due to fewer new issuance opportunities and reduced activity levels compared to the beginning of 2022. Lending balances declined this quarter to $144 billion, led by pay-downs in securities-based lending, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Importantly, our strategy is working and we are seeing channel migration from workplace to adviser-led. Adviser-led flows, originating from workplace relationships reached $28 billion in this quarter alone, double versus this time last year and this compares to the approximate $50 billion we saw annually over the past 3 years. Furthermore, almost 90% of these flows were from assets held away, also consistent with what we have seen historically. Our strategy remains in place to best serve our clients and support the firm's path to reach $10 trillion in client assets. Moving to Investment Management, revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year, primarily on lower AUM due to the decline of asset values and the cumulative effect of outflows over the prior year. Total AUM ended at $1.4 trillion. Long-term net outflows were $2.4 billion as equity outflows moderated in the quarter. In fixed income, outflows in floating rate loans were partially offset by high yield and emerging markets. Finally, alternatives and solutions delivered strength, driven mostly by demand for Parametric's fixed income customized portfolios as well as inflows into private credit. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $13.9 billion. Positive liquidity inflows of $37 billion were partially offset by outflows related to a single client relationship. Asset management and related fees decreased versus the prior year to $1.2 billion due to lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue. Performance-based income and other revenues were $41 million. Results were supported by gains in our private alternatives portfolio, reflecting the diversity of the platform. Integration-related expenses were $24 million in the quarter in line with expectations. A key focus area remains maximizing our global distribution capabilities and we continue to see momentum internationally, particularly from the Eaton Vance fixed income team. Our investments across a broad array of strategies and capabilities, including active ETFs, Parametric customization and alternatives position us well to benefit from the diversification as well as to serve our global client base. Turning to the balance sheet, spot assets were $1.2 trillion, largely in line with the prior quarter. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1% and SLR at 5.5%. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily on client activity, consistent with seasonal patterns. We continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, including buying back $1.5 billion of common stock. Our tax rate was 19.3% for the quarter. The vast majority of share-based award conversion takes place in the first quarter, creating a tax benefit. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility. As James discussed, the fallout resulting from the events in March is not indicative of the systemic stress that the industry faced during the global financial crisis. Our clear and consistent strategy allowed us to enter this environment well positioned. The outlook for the remainder of this year is difficult to predict. We are keenly aware that opening and functioning markets and economic stability are integral in aiding confidence moving forward. In the interim, we remain focused on supporting our clients and attracting assets to our platform. With that, we will now open up the line to questions. Certainly. The adviser recruiting pipeline remains healthy. We continue to see assets aggregated from all channels, as I mentioned, both recruiting, adviser-led and workplace and when we compare it to a year ago, I think that what we continue to see is that we remain a destination of choice, not only for new advisers, but also obviously, as we stated, from the assets held away that we continue to aggregate in both the net new assets from existing and from new clients. So first, let's take NII. As we said, what we have been looking at is we thinking about it in terms of modeled client behavior. Obviously, March itself had a different modeled client behavior than we probably would have expected for other months within the quarter. But when we look ahead, we are currently not expecting expansion of the quarterly NII as we go forward. Now as that relates to the margin, a 26% margin, obviously, is still impacted by certain things, such as integration-related expenses. We mentioned also litigation and we continue to really invest in the model as we go \u2013 as we have and also as we go forward. All of that being said our eyes are still on the 30% goal that we have set forth and we will continue to achieve as we move through time to progress to those goals. So I think that for us to predict exactly what the behavior will be. Obviously, if we think about what happened in March, that's a very difficult thing to predict. But I think what you're highlighting in your question, Glenn, as I parse out the very beginning of it, is right now, cash and cash equivalents are at a higher level, a higher level than we have ever seen historically. As we begin to see those assets be deployed into different types of products that ability and that advice will obviously be accretive. It will also help us as you see asset levels rise. So there is a pull/push factor as you think about those things. In addition to that, as we continue to aggregate assets, we will gain from scale, the more assets that we see, the more we will see in balances, the more that will probably help as you think about just what the cash balances are more broadly because assets are being attracted platform. And in addition to that, we will gain for the longer objectives of what that might mean for the margin and for the wealth management business more broadly. Absolutely. I think what's important about that portfolio is that it is diversified, in addition to that, we have been reducing the exposure in the ISG direct CRE portfolio over the course of the last year or so. So obviously, we keep our eyes on it. As you know, CECL is a life-of-loan concept. And so as you see economic deterioration, you do need to account for that. And the same goes for what we're seeing in the commercial real estate market. So I think that those are the two main points I would point you to is that it is diversified, and we have been continuing to reduce that direct exposure. I'm going to try and remember all of your questions, Steve, in order. So if I forget one, just remind me. The first point on FRC, I'll take first. In terms of the regionals, more broadly, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I believe we had about $90 billion that came in without any relationship to those regionals. And so that shows cases to you that's well above the average that we've seen. So I think it just continues to show that the investments that we have made are really working as we move forward. So that's sort of point number one. The second point that I mentioned, and I think you asked where are those assets coming from? It's really \u2013 in this particular quarter was in that adviser-led space both from existing accounts and new clients. To me, what was most remarkable when I was going through the diligence materials really was what we're seeing from clients. So the idea that we continue to be a destination of choice for our existing clients and attracting assets held away, again, speak to all the conversations that we've all had over the course of the last 7 years or so talking about investments to give our advisers more time to service their clients as we move forward. Then the final question that you asked around the fee-based flows actually a very strong fee-based flow number, to be honest, from our perspective in an environment where individuals \u2013 we think about it, cash and cash equivalents are high. You're thinking about putting your money into managed kind of accounts associated with it from that fee-based concept, you're unlikely to do that in a period of time where you think the cash and cash equivalents and safety might be what you're looking for right now. And so that is, in fact, the dry powder that we have that over time could move into the fee-based assets. So I think it's actually a strong number given the environment that we have on the backdrop. As it relates to April, I talked a little bit in one of the earlier questions about modeled client behavior. And that what we did see is that in March, we really deviated from some of that modeled client behavior. Now in April, we have been more in line with modeled client behavior. So that does speak to your point of maybe we are in a position where from a transactional patch level, we are there. But again, as James said, it is an uncertain environment. And so from that perspective, we will have to wait and see how we move through time from here. I think that your question in terms of April in terms of where it's coming from the exact breakdown is challenging to see in terms of exactly where it's coming from, from all of the deposits perspective because there is could, as you know, cash is fungible, so you could take something and then move it into a different security or a different asset. To parse that out, is challenging. I do think that what's more important, as you highlight, is that it is tax season. And so to not see an acceleration is obviously one of the more optimistic signs that you are moving through more model client behavior. Now what it means from funding, we obviously have many funding different places. I don't think that funding is concern, as you mentioned, it does matter from an NII perspective, but it will be a function of two things, Brennan. As you know, rate expectations have also changed since January. And so our NII forecast and predictions are based on models client behavior in terms of cash, sweep etcetera, and also where interest rates are and where the forward curve is for Fed bonds. And so as you begin to see if that changes, that could change your NII forecast. We are still, if you look at models client behavior, asset sensitive. And so from that perspective, I think that gives you a few different pieces to put together in terms of how to think about the forward look based on deferred assumptions. So the best way to think about the stickiness within the system is actually NNA right, because you're going to see the outflows would be a net negative to the NNA more broadly. And so the consistent growth over time, if you look at it all the way back even to when we saw promotional levels back, I remember we spoke about this in \u201818 and I think it was \u201817 and \u201818. In those early years, that was still seeing net new asset inflows over time. So, for me, the most important thing is, well, what's the net, the net continues to be positive and continues to ramp higher. In terms of the CD exact offerings and what that would mean from NNA, it's considered NNA if it's brought out from outside of the firm. And again, what's important here is that we continue to see more in the advisor-led space. And that over time, again, think about the channel migration from workplace into the advisor-led space. What's important here is that when people begin to seed money into advisor-led, we actually see more money from assets held away. So, I know that doesn't answer your question directly, but I think it's important to highlight, as people begin to work with an advisor, what we said to you is 90% of the assets that then come are from assets held away outside the building. So, just again, another proof point that once they understand what the advisor has to offer, it helps aggregate new assets into our system. So, I don't actually know that it's the absolute value \u2013 the rate level. And I will answer it in two different ways. First, you have to remember that the events in March didn't make people \u2013 I mean, we all read the popular press and most individuals begin to think about what is the most risk-free asset, that being a U.S. treasuries. So, one should not be surprised if they begin to move assets into U.S. treasuries. So, I do think that it's a function also of uncertainty and not just the absolute level of where interest rates are or aren't. Now, as I have said, we have these moments that are opportunistic, both when you think about the corporate activity and then when you think about the individual activities, so both for ISG and in Wealth Management. And that was evidenced last August, last October and then earlier in January and February that when markets become calm that you begin to see movements into asset classes and further activity as evidenced by our self-directed channel as well. So, I don't know that there is an absolute level of rates, but I would say it's related to confidence in the system more broadly and a belief in asset levels being in a place that will bottom and then potentially will rise as we go forward. As it relates specifically to the construction loans, I don't know about the exact construction loans that you might have. I am certain that somewhere there could be a construction loan. But more broadly, I think the absolute level, we do disclose from the ISG side around that $10 billion, and that was in our filings from last quarter. On capital opportunities, in Europe. Sorry, could you repeat what's the question? Certainly, I mentioned is actually when I spoke at a February conference this year, which is that when you think about financial sponsors, they may be in a different position than what we would consider traditional M&A, i.e., they are faster to market. They are in a position where you might not have the same level of activity from a Board. And because of the size, you might have different regulatory restrictions. And so from that perspective, we would expect that they might be first before we see really traditional activity open up. And that is \u2013 that remains kind of the view that we have and also as the pipeline begins to build, that's also what we are seeing. In order for that to move forward and become realized, it's really about the opening of the markets in terms of the financing activity. As we have seen some of the backlogs clear, that's clearly very helpful. But again, it's about stabilization and it's about confidence. Certainly. So, let's take Asia first. What we saw over the course of the quarter was China reopening, obviously, supporting us from the equities side and perspective in terms of client engagement. And what's going right also from Asia has been the \u2013 what we have a franchise that we have really built in Japan. And in an environment where interest rate dynamics change, such as what's going on within Japan, that certainly helped us from the macro perspective and the macro business within fixed income. So, I think that we are \u2013 that's very important and critical is that it speaks to the global perspective, and it speaks to our global franchise. Why that is important when you think about investment management, and I will tie the two together is that you have to invest more broadly to be able to create an environment of diversification. And so Asia might be asleep. Japan, for example, could be asleep for many years, and all of a sudden, Central Bank activity picks up, and you are there to support your clients with that global franchise. Think about investment management quite similarly. What we are doing is we continue to build a franchise where we are able to have diversified products that are there to capture our client assets. You highlighted what's going on within the investment management. Well, asset levels are down tremendously. However, since we have purchased and we announced the deal associated with Eaton Vance. Look at Parametric, we have raised over $45 billion in that product alone, again, diversification of the portfolio, diversification of product to be there in a period of time where you see activity. That's what we are trying to do and build. So, the \u2013 our business has done. I think management has done a phenomenal job in really transforming this business to be a client-centric model focused on velocity of assets, focused on supporting our clients. So, the deeper we have gotten into that, the more we have been able to grow our wallet share more broadly and we have been able to be in and around this 10% number. So, that's clearly based on the activity that we have seen. Now to your point, should we see an opening up of markets could there be greater activity, that would also obviously support the wallet more broadly, but we would expect to be there to continue to gain our appropriate share of that client activity. We continued to invest in that business more broadly. You can see that even on the technology side. We are really proud of the equity franchise and business and the transformation that's had for well over a decade being a market leader. Clearly, as we think about committing capital, it's also, again, about our clients being active in that market as we see. And I highlighted this in my prepared remarks, we do see client balances increase. We have obviously been there to support our clients. And we are looking for the appropriate risk-adjusted return as we continue to invest in that business. Jeremy, as you remember, that moves around with the investments. You will see both on the revenue line and the expense line. And so you should look at them together, and that's why we have enhanced the disclosure so that you can think about them from both sides, understand both the margin and the comp ratio, both historically and as we move forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\nTed Pick: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered strong revenues of $15.4 billion, $3 billion of net income and a 17.5% return on tangible. The results reflect top-line growth across our businesses and demonstrate operating leverage. Year-to-date results reflect the firm's ability to generate consistent quarterly performance, $15 billion of revenues, sequential EPS of $2.02, $1.82, and $1.88, and year-to-date returns on tangible of 18%. Across the firm, we advanced toward our strategic goals while continuing to invest in growth. We are delivering on asset aggregation by leveraging our unique platform and scale in Wealth and Investment Management. Through the first nine months, we achieved $200 billion of organic growth. It's worth noting that over the last year, total client assets are up almost $1.4 trillion. Total client assets across Wealth and Investment Management have now reached $7.6 trillion, on the road to $10 trillion. Our strategic investments across the Integrated Investment Bank are reflected through share gains in our Institutional franchise. The breadth and depth of our global team working seamlessly across all three regions was evident through the summer and post Labor Day, as we helped clients navigate volatility against economic and policy uncertainty. As a whole, the Integrated Firm is achieving operating leverage with our year-to-date efficiency ratio improving by approximately 300 basis points to 72%. We have achieved this while continuing to thoughtfully invest across business and infrastructure priorities. Institutional and individual clients are engaged and we are well-positioned to capture opportunities against different market condition backdrops. Strong fee-based flows in Wealth and the strong performance in Institutional Securities speak to clients seeking Morgan Stanley's advice. Improved underwriting markets combined with increasing participation among financial sponsors and corporates across Investment Banking support a constructive outlook. A broadening equity market and evolving interest rate policy are favorable backdrops for our markets businesses. Continued individual client focus on tax customization strategies are a tailwind for our Parametric business inside Investment Management. Now, with three quarters of 2024 on the board, we are striking a cadence that we will execute against. Our team is unified across the four pillars of: strategy, culture, financial strength and growth. Morgan Stanley's strategy is to raise, manage and allocate capital for institutions and individuals. We will continue to execute on this strategy with a culture of rigor, humility and partnership. And with high levels of capital and liquidity, Morgan Stanley will continue to execute on a plan of durable growth across our Integrated Firm. Sharon will now take us through the quarter. Nice job, SY.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $15.4 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.88, and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results in the third quarter show the inherent strengths of our business model and our ability to grow revenues while also driving profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. In addition to strong revenue growth, efficiency gains are the result of disciplined prioritization of our controllable spend. An ongoing review of our real estate footprint as well as lower litigation and consulting spend contributed to this year's operating leverage while maintaining strong infrastructure to support ongoing growth. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion. Notwithstanding advisory and equity underwriting markets remaining below historical averages, the segment's revenues represented a near record third quarter. Performance accelerated towards the end of the quarter and was driven by the benefits of scale and the global reach of our Integrated Investment Bank. Activity outside the U.S. drove the segment's outperformance relative to historical averages. Our global footprint positioned us well to capture share. As risk events around the world drove activity, including the Bank of Japan's monetary policy changes, shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut and China's announced stimulus, we supported our clients. Investment Banking revenues increased to $1.5 billion. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued strength in underwriting, led by debt underwriting, and further aided by a pickup in advisory revenues. Steady improvements in corporate and sponsor activity as well as our investments in talent and client relationships are yielding results. Advisory revenues of $546 million increased year-over-year on modestly higher completed M&A transactions in the quarter, with particular strength in EMEA. Large fee events from closed deals in EMEA, including those involving financial sponsors, supported the strongest quarter in over a decade for the region. Equity underwriting revenues were $362 million. While global market volumes remain well below historical trend lines, revenues were higher year-over-year, with a notable pickup of activity in Asia, driven by IPOs and follow-ons. Fixed income underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior year to $555 million. Results were driven by strong non-investment grade issuance, supported by both refinancing and event-driven activity, as well as a record third quarter volumes in the investment grade market. Pipelines are healthy and diverse. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multi-year capital markets recovery. Corporate activity is gaining momentum, and the desire among sponsors to transact is steadily materializing, not only domestically but also abroad. While we are cognizant of the broader macroeconomic risks at play, we are well-positioned to deliver the Integrated Firm with a deliberate focus on comprehensive solutions for our global clients. Equity revenues were robust at $3 billion. The business navigated bouts of market volatility well and remained nimble as we supported clients, in particular, performance in the Americas and Asia was strong. Prime brokerage revenues were above historical averages, as client balances, once again, reached a new peak, driven by higher equity markets. Cash results improved versus the prior year, reflecting higher volumes across the regions. Derivative results were also up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in client activity coupled with an improved trading environment in Asia associated with China's announced stimulus in the final weeks of September. Fixed income revenues were $2 billion, driven by strength in macro, particularly rates, largely offset by results in commodities that were stronger in the prior year. Results reflect solid performance in EMEA and Asia, as well as a coordinated global effort to support clients through periods of volatility. Macro revenues increased versus the prior year, attributed to higher client engagement as our rates business navigated the markets well amid shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut. Micro results were roughly flat year-over-year. Results in commodities declined compared to the strong prior year, which benefited from elevated volatility in energy markets. Turning to ISG lending and provision. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $68 million, driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by an improved outlook. Net charge-offs were $100 million in the commercial real estate and corporate loans. Turning to Wealth Management. In the third quarter, the business produced a record revenue of $7.3 billion and record PBT, highlighting the model's strong operating leverage. Strength in Wealth Management reflects a combination of constructive markets and a disciplined execution of our strategy. Client assets in Wealth Management reached $6 trillion. Fee-based flows were strong, demonstrating the power of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel and the value of advice. Our multichannel model is driving durable long-term growth and profitability, benefiting from continued investments in our expanded offering and technology. Moving on to our business metrics. Pre-tax profits of $2.1 billion drove the margin to 28.3%. In the quarter, DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 90 basis points. Asset management revenues were $4.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows and higher markets. Fee-based flows in the quarter were robust at $36 billion and year-to-date flows are on pace to exceed last year, supported by an ongoing contribution of assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. Clients are diversifying fee-based accounts to include fixed income and alternative products. Fee-based assets now stand at $2.3 trillion. Net new assets were $64 billion, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $195 billion, which represents 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by our advisor-led and workplace channels, with a notable contribution from new clients in the advisor-led channel. Transactional revenues were $1.1 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 10% year-over-year. Overall, higher levels of client activity supported results. Loan growth was $4 billion for the second consecutive quarter, driven by mortgages. Total deposits increased sequentially to $358 billion. While average sweeps were down slightly, the recent stabilization, particularly -- we've seen recent signs of stabilization, particularly as the Fed began cutting rates. This is encouraging. Net interest income was $1.8 billion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect NII to be modestly down from the third quarter results, largely on the back of lower rate expectations, consistent with the forward curve. We are committed to continuing to execute as the opportunity in front of us remains significant. We currently touch 19 million relationships, 1.3 million more than last year. Our expanded offering includes unique market access for high-net-worth clients across a broad range of alternative products and, more recently, robust private market services, which continues to attract demand. We are investing in our intellectual capital, unique products and an integrated infrastructure to help our advisors serve their clients. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.5 billion increased 9% compared to the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management and related fees, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM. Long-term net flows were approximately $7 billion. Inflows were primarily driven by continued demand in alternatives and solutions, and were further supported by our fixed income strategies. Since the acquisition of Eaton Vance within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios have been a consistent source of strength. Our multi-year investments into Investment Management's partnership with Wealth Management includes initiatives around advisor education on our tax-efficient product capabilities. This has helped drive steady demand originating from our own Wealth Management clients as well as the broader retail base. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $9.3 billion, led by our Parametric overlay strategies. Performance-based income and other revenues were $71 million. Results supported gains in infrastructure and real estate. MSIM's total AUM now stands at $1.6 trillion. Our investments in customization and alternatives are showing returns, demonstrated by positive long-term flows this quarter. We continue to invest in secular growth products in order to meet global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets grew to $1.3 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased sequentially to $490 billion, as we actively supported clients. We accreted approximately $2 billion of Common Tier 1 capital. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1%. We continue to deliver on our commitment to the dividend, which we raised to $0.925 per quarter in this quarter, and we bought back $750 million of common stock during the quarter. Our year-to-date results serve as hard evidence that we are executing on the opportunity set, benefiting from being global and diversified with the resources to invest in growth. Across Wealth and Investment Management, we reached $7.6 trillion of total client assets. Expanding markets and increased client engagement should further support asset growth as we progress toward $10 trillion in client assets. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nSharon Yeshaya: Hey, good morning, Steve.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Chubak: Ted. Hey, Sharon. How are you both doing? So, wanted to start off with just a question on op leverage. You noted that the management team has been very focused on driving more efficiency. We're definitely seeing now on the ISG side, 75% incremental margins, even in Wealth, you're delivering 35% incremental margins. Just wanted to gauge the sustainability of some of those higher-marginal margins, just given some of the efforts you cited on the efficiency side while continuing to invest for growth?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. Thank you for the question, and thank you for noting the progress. We have been really focused on this over the course of the year, and I'd say that it's not -- the intention has not been to be shortsighted, but rather to take a very long-term lens as we think about efficiency. Over the course of this spring, we began to look not only at one-year budget, but really two- to three-year outlook, not just about revenues, but also understanding where are the efficiencies that we have to gain and where can we consolidate certain investments in order to make room for what would be investments in growth. I highlighted occupancy, because that's one that's notable in the SEC disclosures. You'll see that over the course of the year-to-date-to-year-to-date basis, so that line item has really only increased about $11 million. And we've made a lot of room to invest in optimization of the space, but also investments of space. You think about data centers, you think about new buildings, you think about new technology and new places that you think need to be used for occupancy. So, there is a way that we're thinking about self-funding. Same goes for a decline in professional services. Some of that was related to -- remember, we were going through many years of integration, and while we stopped disclosing on an integration basis, there were still places that we thought that we could augment what we were looking at from a professional service basis and where we were thinking about long-term gains. On the other side of that, you've seen increases in places like BC&E, because we have been in a position where we've been supporting our clients. We're also making space investing in the infrastructure as we think about the growth that we have going forward. Some of that just has to do with cyber resilience, thing that you would expect us to do as we grow the business going forward. But we're also looking at places where we're investing for FAs, new products, new technology that can give them space to go and prosecute new clients, which you see in our net new assets the course of the quarter. And broadly, as you think about risk and controls, you need to make sure that you have all of the right, like I said, infrastructure, really the foundation and the building blocks so that when you have growth, you're able to support it on a go-forward basis. So, we've been looking at it from both sides, Steve, and it is a multi-year process, and we would continue to do that not just in this business cycle and this budget cycle, but as we go forward over multiple years.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for all that perspective, Sharon. And maybe just for a quick follow-up, on the Wealth business, the KPIs were quite strong across the board, clearly reflects very strong momentum in the third quarter, especially in September. Just wanted to better understand what -- if there were any idiosyncratic factors that maybe drove some of that strength. Inevitably, when you see that type of momentum, it begs the question as to how durable or sustainable some of those KPIs might be and especially focused on just the growth in sweep deposits, which was certainly a nice surprise?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. Specifically, I'd say actually all the KPIs and all the underlying is strong, sweeps being one that I called out as the deposit trends are certainly encouraging, especially since the Fed began to cut rates. We've seen that over the back end of September and even as we look into the beginning of the fourth quarter on a relative basis in terms of expectations. So, that has been positive. The underlying for me on all of the asset growth, both on NNA as well as fee-based assets, there's not one particular driver, but rather you've seen the advice-based side really picking up. You've seen clients and FAs engage. There continues to be investments into markets on a monthly level from brokerage sweeps, which you didn't see last year. So, needless to say, the markets are improving. You're seeing momentum in the economy. Uncertainties are lifting and retail clients are engaged both from seeking advice but also coming to the platform as new clients, which I think is a particularly good trend to watch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nTed Pick: Hey, Ebrahim.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning, Ted. I guess, maybe just first question on capital priorities. Just talk to us in terms of how you're thinking about the capital ratio today in context of -- we're still waiting for the Basel re-proposal, but more importantly, I think the history of the last 10 years has been excellent capital allocation organic or inorganic. As you're looking at the world today, Ted, where are you deploying capital? Where are the best investment opportunities? Is it in market? Is it in wealth? Is it in international? Would love to get your perspective.\nTed Pick: Thanks for the question. As you know, we're at 15.1% CET1. The new number is 13.5%. So, our buffer is 160 basis points. We like that buffer. It gives us room to operate. You saw that we had some risk-weighted asset increase, but we still managed to keep the ratios at 15%-plus. So, there's a story here, which is to continue to price best-in-class financial strength along the lines of capital and liquidity, but also to lean into the businesses as the market opportunity affords. We did that clearly in both businesses. You saw it in the Investment Bank, where we gained share across the primary and both markets businesses, but you also saw it in Wealth Management, some of the technology spend that Sharon described. In the sort of forced hierarchy of what we would wish to do at any given moment around capital allocation, as we said before, it's the dividend first that is sacrosanct and we continue to grow it. Second here, because of the secular growth and where we are in the cycle, as Sharon just described, there is a good cause to be investing in all three segments, Wealth Management, Investment Management and the Investment Bank, and to do so across the world. We're clearly seeing rates of equitization increasing in places like Japan and India and on the continent. So, having a global franchise and investing in that, we think is existentially important. And then, the buyback is opportunistic. We'll be buying back $3 billion-plus this year, as that's an ongoing lever that we're going to pull. Of course, the Basel uncertainty likely lasts through the election and we have our points of advocacy that are aligned with the industry, but also those things that matter very much to Morgan Stanley specifically. And we're going to continue to make our case concertedly, respectfully, and we'll see how it plays out after the election. But as it stands now, 160 basis points of buffer on CET1, 5.5% SLR, we are investing in the business, we're achieving operating leverage. So, these things are always a movable feast, but we are keeping a very close eye on it and we're happy with how we're optimizing the allocation.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And one quick follow-up for you, Sharon, on sweep deposits, NII, all that good stuff. Just as we think about rate cuts, clients kind of -- maybe serving a trigger event for clients to reallocate how they'd invest. Is the NII, give or take, close to a bottom because of a certain level of sort of -- I think you've talked in the past about cash balances that clients have maintained. Are we close to that? And if we get QT maybe before the end of the year, could those deposit balances potentially have one less headwind and as a result grow looking into next year despite rate cuts?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So, let me take the last part of your question first just to be clear. QT hasn't really been a driver for us. I'd say that's more for a commercial bank. So, in either direction, I don't think it has to do with a decline or an increase. So, I'd put that aside, because our deposit base is just slightly different. When we look at where we've been and the types of language that we've used historically, I'd say that just to put it in context, the rate environment has changed. It's changed since the second quarter and I'd say it's changed pretty materially. So, we don't have control as we all know in terms of where interest rates are going. What I can speak to is where we are from a deposit level. And as I said, the trends that we've seen are extremely encouraging. If you think about where we've come from and where we are over the course of the last couple of weeks, especially when the Fed -- ever since the Fed has cut interest rates. The near-term guidance that I gave is that we will likely be modestly down over the course -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And where we will be as we look into 2025, I think we will re-evaluate based on where sweeps are, one, but more importantly, on the forward, is likely where interest rates are, which will be a function of what does the Fed do in November, what does it do in December, and what is the path for '25 when we sit at the beginning of January. But I just want to put a little bit of perspective around the conversations that we've had about sweeps and NII over the course of the last couple of years. I understand that it's been a very important topic for investors, especially when you think about sweeps, in particular. But sweeps, as I said, have been, to some degree, stabilizing. And when you look at NII for Morgan Stanley, on a relative basis, think about where we were last year in the third quarter. The delta between NII this quarter and last quarter is $175 million. We make $100 million a day in this business every single day. And so, I think that we really need to begin to think about what is the model, what are we thinking about and how are we executing in the model. Asset management fee-based revenues, that increase this year, is double the decline of NII. So, we just need to gain a bit of perspective now that we see where sweeps are, that the markets are coming back and that we continue to see asset management fees rise and that is the durable revenue and what we expect to see from this business model as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nTed Pick: Hey, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Hello there. Okay. So, with RWA up 10%, I had assumed that it was trading and client-led with PB balances at record highs and it comes with a bar that's actually down a little bit. So, I'm curious, do you think that ebbs and flows with just the environment, or is there some of the -- your capital plan continue to feed this great client franchise across markets? And I'll just ask the follow-up with it, because I think it goes together better. With all of that, Wealth hasn't -- now that you've made a lot of investments, Wealth doesn't need a lot more capital infusion if you will. Based on how you're going about your capital plan, do you envision any material shifts in literally business mix? We've gotten all very accustomed and used to a big percentage of this company being asset and wealth management. Thanks for both of those.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Let me take them backwards, Glenn, just so I'll talk to Wealth. Wealth sees a steady -- a very small but steady increase when you look back in history associated with RWAs. And a lot of that just has to do with the lending growth. And as we think about greater household penetration, greater usage of those products by FAs and offering that to our client base, that will probably -- that's kind of where you'll see that capital allocation as we move forward. When you think about ISG though and the RWAs has been implemented in the business there, if you look at the loans and lending commitments, you'll see that where we've actually seen a lot of the growth is really on corporates. And a lot of that underlying is corporates, and all of the FSL, so the FID Secured Lending. That is inherent to the Integrated Investment Bank and the Integrated Firm. We have said over the course of the last two years that we expect this to be a Investment Banking-led recovery. We've also said and we've invested in individuals. And when you think about talent in terms of the Investment Bank more broadly, that's where you're seeing the RWAs being put to work. And that's actually also where you're seeing the results, right? That's where you're seeing an increase in DCM, an increase in different parts of the balance of fixed income coming from more lending durable financing revenue. So, it's very much alongside what we're thinking about the stabilization and the durability of the Investment Bank rather than something that's necessarily more episodic. Of course, it will ebb and flow as you see deals and transactions and that environment for those corporates, but that's how I would think about it broadly.\nTed Pick: Yeah. What I'd add to that is what is important, too, as you look through the metrics, Glenn, is that the revenues in the Investment Bank are up 20% year-over-year and roughly flat down 2% sequentially, but in that same period, the trading bar, the value of risk across the Investment Bank is running flattish. And that is -- in fact, it's slightly down. So, we were able to put up some real operating leverage without taking up the underlying measured risk in the business, which speaks to sort of the type of durable revenue model that Sharon described across our Integrated Investment Bank.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\nTed Pick: Hi, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, good morning, Ted and Sharon. First question on NII in Wealth. Obviously, a lot goes into that, but it would be great if you could maybe speak to some of the second order impacts of lower interest rates that we should be thinking about and maybe some that are a little bit less obvious like changes in margin utilization or securities lending or securities-based loans or even customer engagement with certain types of products or really anything else I'm missing there. Just love to kind of get some more flavor around the implications and how you guys are thinking about the second order impacts on NII as you look out over the next year or so.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. We continue -- as I mentioned, this is the second quarter that we've seen loan growth. I wouldn't -- we've seen stronger quarters. So, this is just the beginning. Basically, there's been a steady increase in mortgages, even though there's the rate hike cycle where it is and the rates were higher. And over time, as rates would come down, you'd expect to begin to see refinancing activity, which will spur lending. You'll also likely see, as you get into tax cycles with asset levels where they are, an increase also in SBL. So, there's -- those lending products have been relatively muted versus the historical basis. And you -- it wouldn't be surprising to begin to see more and more of that activity on the forward.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Sharon. And then, just want to come back to the -- really nice quarter you put up in net new assets in Wealth. And you touched on a notable contribution from new clients in advisor-led. And so, I'm just curious if there's anything else you can highlight that supported that momentum with new clients, specifically, whether it's new products or if there's programs internally that you're running to support that because it sounds like it was a catalyst. I'm just curious if that could continue.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So, specifically on new clients, Devin, I'd remind you a conversation that Jed had when he spoke publicly recently, which was really about what we're doing on stock plan and different ways that we're introducing FAs to new clients. We call them human referrals. It's a place where you begin to think about if someone's calling, for example, into a call center or they've come to a different event, and they'd like to actually be matched with a financial advisor. Remember, we're using technology, different parts of AI and different ways to begin to appropriately match individuals with FAs we think will suit them. That -- those human referrals are double and over 100,000 year-to-date versus what you've seen in the past. So, I think that, that's a place where we've invested in technology. We understand now how to better match and understand individuals and their needs. And we're giving them an opportunity to see the value of the advice on the forward, and that's what you're seeing in those numbers in terms of the net new assets. So, it's really bearing fruit in terms of the investments we've made.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Dan.\nDan Fannon: Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could expand upon some of the strength of activity outside the U.S. Some of the events you cited seem country specific, but can you talk to how you see the rest of the world participating and what you guys have said will be in Investment Banking recovery? And certainly we know the U.S. is focused in terms of the potential cap markets recovery, but curious as how you think about the broader base outside the U.S.\nTed Pick: The Integrated Investment Bank premise that we built over the last 10 years and really intensified over the last five years was that it takes a real local commitment to have a global investment bank. We've made real investments on the continent, for example, in Iberia, in Italy, in France. We continue to be the largest presence actually as tenancy matter in Canary Wharf, so in the UK. So, our European commitment is real across both Investment Banking and increasingly in the markets business. That's in the Investment Bank. But also we have a thriving Investment Management business, LPs, who are well ensconced on the continent, and we're building that integrated capability with alternative solutions and the like. We have been strong, as you know, in Asia for really decades. And that spoke to the power of a global investment banking institution that when we had disruptive events, as Sharon alluded to, in Tokyo and then in China in the last couple of months leading into this quarter, it was important that we have a leading investment banking and markets presence, both in Japan and in Hong Kong and Mainland. So here, the seamless execution will pay off as cross-border M&A intensifies as parts of the world outside of the U.S., where, of course, we have our concentrated bet as a regional matter, to the point you were asking, you see good growth in revenues both in Asia and in Europe. You saw year-over-year growth of almost 25% for the firm in EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and then 30%-plus in Asia. That speaks to having a local presence such that when the Investment Banking cycle really kicks in and companies wish to engage in strategic activity, which includes, obviously, getting bigger or making a sale and potentially go public locally that we're going to have the kind of presence to transact. So, running the global investment bank is going to pay for years to come. And I would add, by the way, that an important part culturally of what we've done at Morgan Stanley for many years which is bearing fruit, is to mobilize some of our senior talent from one region to another, not just across businesses but across regions, which is important when you have 30 of your 80,000 people outside the United States that they're familiar with our operations in places like India and Budapest.\nDan Fannon: Great. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, within Investment Management, [longer-term] (ph) inflows certainly a positive, but if we look at the backdrop, markets are up significantly year-to-date, revenues have moved modestly, but still have expenses. So, as you think about the asset mix that's coming in the door that's skewed more towards lower fee, whether that's within Parametric or fixed income, how do you expect or how do you plan on improving the overall profitability of that segment as you think about the longer-term trends that are putting more pressure on fees?\nSharon Yeshaya: I'll take that. So, you're right to identify that there is a mix shift as we're seeing different types of flows. I'd also note, though, there are also investments being made when you think about just the expenses to help make sure that we're there to service the clients in terms of where we're seeing the secular growth trends. So, it's an asset story on Parametric. It's an asset story on alternatives. We're investing in both. Both of those are places we see secular growth trends, and we're making sure to be there with -- for our clients. Now alternatives is going to be higher fees, just basic private credit, et cetera, will be higher fees than you might see in Parametric. That being said, I don't see it simply as a fee sort of game, but rather the greater the assets, the more opportunity and the more to be the leader in the space and to continue to attract new capital to seek new opportunities. So, overall, I see it more as a strategy associated with asset building, aggregation and being there to service our clients, but also making sure that we have the capital there to invest. So, things like Parametric, you're going to need to spend money on more market data. You're going to need to build relationships with Wealth. And that's going to cost money on margin in the short term, but it will give us the opportunity for growth as we move forward over the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: Hey, Ted, good morning. All right. So, I'm willing to risk the wrath of Sharon here and ask a question on NII. And I totally appreciate it's just a part of the Wealth business, right? So, totally get that. But I thought it was really encouraging to see the end-of-period deposit costs tick down pretty decently quarter-over-quarter. So, maybe is that driven by the fact that you've seen a lot of those deposits shift into like the higher cost and therefore, higher beta products? And so, would that be sustainable? And then, when we're thinking about a combination of that de facto higher beta, the potential for reinvestment tailwinds in the securities book and loan growth, is it too optimistic to think that NII could grow next year?\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, Brennan. I appreciate that you do understand the business, and you do understand that there are multiple drivers of this business. I think what you're hitting on is that there are a lot of places that you can still see growth that is not specific only to the deposit mix. So, yes, it's encouraging to see certain pieces. Now, of course, you also had our Fed rate cut in there. So that will continue to bring the cost of certain types of deposits. You think about the beta, the beta will really depend, like you alluded to, also on products. So, things like a savings product will have a much higher beta than something like a sweeps product, which will have a much lower beta. They just -- they are two different products with two different purposes in terms of the dynamics of what they're used for. Now, on the forward, it will, of course, depend on the Fed rate path. There are so many changes that have taken place over the course of the last quarter that make it very difficult to say, well, where will the Fed be, and where will be those investment opportunities. So, where I would sort of point to is there are three pieces that we've always talked about that will drive NII. Two of them are encouraging. That's the growth on the asset side in terms of where you're seeing us being able to actually deploy the capital, where you're seeing people ask for lending opportunities, et cetera, it's growing, it's encouraging. Sweeps, what we know and what we've seen, especially since the first rate cut, is also very encouraging, particularly as historically, if you look back, and I said this in the last quarter call, generally speaking, when you begin to see interest rate cuts, you do begin to see different parts of deposits rise. So, again, an encouraging sign. Where will it be when you think about reinvestment and the rest of NII? That in and of itself is really the Fed. And if we go back a quarter ago, no one -- it was a very low probability to see a 50 basis point rate cut, and lo and behold, we have one. So, why don't we see where we are after the November and December meetings and then restate kind of where we think we'll be over the course of the year just from a rate perspective. But those three building blocks, you know what they are and you know that the two that are under our control or they have to do sort of -- I wouldn't say, under our control, but rather have to do with what our clients are doing. I've told you what I'm seeing from our data, and it's all positive.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Totally. That's helpful. Thanks, Sharon. And then, for the follow-up, maybe shifting gears a little bit. You spoke to sponsor engagement. We've seen some sponsors actually start to hit the IPO market. Given your strength in ECM and the strong franchise you have there, what are you seeing on the IPO pipeline front? And how should we be thinking about that outlook into next year?\nTed Pick: Well, as you know, the sponsors have roughly $1.3 trillion of dry powder. They have $3 trillion to $4 trillion of portfolio companies in the ground by some measures, 10,000 companies in the ground. And for the first time in close to 15 years there, the deployment is outpacing the fundraising. So, there is a need for that group to move. And they act as a liquidity source, but they also act as a competitive player to our traditional corporate community. I think much has been said about the barriers to entry to be a highly regulated [indiscernible] public company. But I would take the view that there are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets. That currency allows them to make acquisitions, to set up long-term compensation plans and like, to go global. So, what I'd expect to see are larger companies going public, having been private for some time, reaching a level that makes them a tougher sale on the private front. There are private alternatives, but the going-public phenomenon is not going away. And I made reference to this earlier, I think there is a going-public phenomenon that will exist around the world, whether it's select countries doing privatizations, whether it's exciting companies that for the first time are reaching global benchmarks. So, I think we're going to see the IPO market slowly work its way back, larger names coming to market. And then, when they do, quite quickly needing the full service suite of a global investment bank, needing the treasury capabilities, needing hedging services, needing the kind of advice at a mid- or large-cap mature company needs, and that, of course, on a global scale is right in our sweet spot. So, I'm bullish on IPOs and M&A coming back. It may take some time. And the size of the companies when they come will be likely larger. So, there will be slower unit volume than the sort of the heyday of post-COVID stimulus and quick listings, but I think these are going to be global mature companies which are going to very much need our advice.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Christian.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, Ted and Sharon. On Wealth Management, really nice to see solid loan growth in the last two quarters. Just thinking a little bit looking forward here as rates come down, kind of how are you thinking about maybe longer-term growth? Do you think loan growth can maybe reaccelerate back to pre-COVID levels where we were seeing 20%-plus growth per year, or is that business more mature today with less growth upside?\nSharon Yeshaya: No, I actually -- thank you for the question. I don't think that it's more mature with less upside. I actually think there's more upside to go when you think about the penetration of FAs using those products. So, we used to be sort of in the low-double-digits in terms of that penetration. That's moved up to somewhere in the teens. But we do think that there's opportunity to surpass that higher. And if you look sort of at peers even in similar kinds of channels, so not lending through a commercial bank, but more on the wealth side, those numbers are higher. So, there are certainly opportunities there, Christian. So that's why I appreciate you asking the question. I wouldn't say it's not just on the mortgage side. That certainly can come back. But SBLs have been relatively flat. And it's not surprising. We've talked a lot about the uses of those lines. And especially if rates are low, thinking about how to use those lines to pay taxes, for example, and think about what you're doing from an efficiency perspective with your portfolio as an individual investor.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more on deposits, Wealth Management deposits again. Appreciate this is maybe a smaller issue now and fading away. But how are you thinking about just the philosophy around deposit pricing within Wealth Management, given some of the SEC scrutiny? And then, maybe any data you can provide around how much of the sweep cash is in the advisory-related assets?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So, why don't we just -- I'll take it to sort of, I guess, together but answer it slightly backwards, which is we talked about different pricing changes. And last quarter, we also said that, that was a small portion in terms of where the changes are going to be made. So, it's small. It's in the run rate. You saw it over the course of the quarter, and it was in the results. When we think about deposit pricing, we take a number of factors into consideration. And one of the most important factors that we highlighted last quarter and we've been looking at even through this cutting cycle are competitive dynamics and where competitive pricing is. So that's -- it's the market, and it's also competition. It's the need for deposits and it's where that is on a relative value perspective. So, all of those things that include the customer as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Ted. Hi, Sharon. In your prepared remarks, you guys talked about your prime brokerage revenues were historical -- above historical averages as clients' balances reach new peaks. Can you share with us how much of that is driven by just existing clients or also you're expanding your client base where you're growing that as well? Can you compare the two areas of driving these numbers?\nTed Pick: Well, I think the question is an interesting one because the barriers to entry to scaling a new asset manager are quite high. But we host, as you're aware, our cap intro conference every January down in Breakers. We've done that for decades and continue to draw enormous demand to try to get a slot. Because once you've made it, the platform economics of success and your ability to penetrate various distribution channels enables you to get big quite quickly. So, it's sort of tough to make it, but once you've made it, you can really scale into a large institution. By and large, though, the growth that we've seen across equities to hit the $3 billion mark over the last couple of quarters you've seen has not been consuming additional VAR. It's just staying close to our clients. These results indicate that we've increased wallet with predominantly the existing base. We've done that around the world. And the leverage levels for a lot of these clients in the quantum platform space are actually run close to the typical range for that subgroup. So, we've been able to interact with them in a productive way across not just prime brokerage, but cash and derivatives, too, and then importantly, across the markets business. So, this is part of this Integrated Investment Bank philosophy that you can have folks that are traditional players in one pocket moving across the asset spectrum, and the leadership in the market business has done a great job facilitating that, not just across underliers, but as I mentioned in the past quarter, across regions. And to the extent that there are spin-outs or others, we have a vibrant business now in the Middle East too, in Abu Dhabi, and in Scandinavia in Copenhagen. Those are the two offices we recently opened. And I mentioned them because they are not just great possible for Investment Banking and for our Investment Management business, but they're also very interesting for our markets business, too.\nGerard Cassidy: Very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up, I always appreciate your guys' insights and others that really don't have big exposures to credit. And so, you mentioned that you had charge-offs of $100 million in commercial real estate and corporate loans. Can you give us any color? Again, you're not a big lender like a JPMorgan or a Bank of America, so insights from folks like you, I think, are very helpful. Any color here?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Those are largely provisioned for. And so, I think what you've seen is that it's almost as though some of the credit changes have been working themselves through the market. If you look back over the course of the last two years, we've had a lot of conversations, Gerard, specifically talking about CRE. You've had some great questions as it relates to that space. We saw that, that was happening. We provisioned for it. And over time, you will see that likely come through on the other side as charge-offs, and that's kind of where we are at this point in the cycle.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hey, good morning. Earlier, you talked about your tech efforts. And so, Ted, as you think about AI, is Morgan Stanley a leader or a close follower, you wait for others to do it? And then, more specifically, what's going on with your partnership with OpenAI? I see a quote here from Morgan Stanley, \"OpenAI is perhaps the best example to date of empowering Morgan Stanley with the marriage of human advice and technology.\" I think you're unique in using OpenAI. So, any color you can provide would be great.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I'll take it because we continue to do work with OpenAI. In terms of where we are overall on the technology side, Mike, you saw a lot of our products very early, say, almost 10 years ago at this point in time when we did our first tech expo. And we looked at tools that we were using AI and different types of machine learning, et cetera, to give our advisors tools to give them more time to prospect business. As it relates specifically to that partnership, that partnership is going extremely well. We continue to look at new platforms and new applications that we can use with them. And there are new places that we're using AI that we've launched and we've discussed over the course of the last two quarters or so. One is, we, obviously, do have a tool where FAs can use and speak to our research portal, so to speak, and understand that AI will basically read everything and then can help you answer different questions associated with what's already been published in terms of that volume of data. In addition to that, as we've moved forward, we can have tools like debrief where an individual, of course, gaining permission in a meeting can use what they've heard in a meeting through AI translate languages, et cetera, summarize and then be able to send out emails as follow-ups based on the conversations had in those meetings with a draft. Obviously, you have human interaction after in a human overlay, but just gives you the bare bones again to save time for the advisors as we move forward. We're doing that across the institution in different pockets and spaces as part of the -- if we think back to the efficiency work that we started this call with, there will be places where we can use AI to also think through efficiencies. So, it's a balance of understanding where to invest and then how to use that to gain time back from a productivity perspective as we move forward.\nTed Pick: And I also like the -- I like the question because it suggests that there are going to be opportunities where being a fast follower is just fine, where you can take existing capability and make the digitization process easier on a straight cost effectiveness play, where -- to Sharon's comments, where we are really digging in as a, call it, proprietary matter is around the productive efficiency inside of Wealth Management. This entire -- we call it AIMS, as you know, AI @ Morgan Stanley. The AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant is just the first chapter of what we're going to do across the financial advisor platform specific to our own offering with clients where we think we're going to have some real edge.\nMike Mayo: You say it's the first chapter of what just -- I know this is looking forward, but what could be some other chapters as it relates to AI?\nTed Pick: At our place? Well, it's going to be a tool at the very least that is going to help inform FAs on what is relevant at any given moment under any different -- any given paradigm. They are going to have access to information across a whole bunch of data sets, ongoing conversations and interactions that are going to allow for crisper and more effective conversations with their clients. I think that will take some time to play out. But when you think about it, extraordinarily effective in terms of the interactions when there will be heightened proclivity to activity between the client and the FA, whether it's around an exogenous event or a life event for the FA to be well-equipped to know what types of products and services might be available down the road is something that we think will be part of the embedded offering.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Saul Martinez with HSBC.\nTed Pick: Saul, good morning.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. Hey, you've had a pretty sustained good fee-based asset flow for some time now. And maybe this quarter was a little bit outside -- outsized. And Sharon, you mentioned the trends of advisor-led brokerage moving to fee-based, clients diversifying to alternatives and fixed income instruments or fixed income. Can you just comment on the extent to which you think these dynamics have legs where we are in terms of these dynamics occurring, given the strength in asset prices and equities and rates coming down and what that might mean for your flow expectations and for fee rates?\nSharon Yeshaya: Yeah. I actually really appreciate the question. I appreciate that you took note of the comments that I gave in the prepared remarks, which is what we've been focused on is really migration and understanding migration of assets. So, we look at -- there's brokerage accounts in self-directed, and there's brokerage accounts when you think about on the advisor side. You have an advisor, but you also have a brokerage account, and not everything is in fee-based. The numbers from brokerage is -- those numbers are increasing in terms of what's actually migrating into fee-based. And why I think that's important is we've always said that we would expect -- oftentimes, the way you see net new assets come into the institution, they come in maybe under an advisor or not. But let's say you're in the advisor side, it comes into a brokerage account first. It doesn't go directly into fee-based. And so, it's really the migration of assets coming in and then seeing that pick up, say, oh, I understand that there's a value to advice, and let me now figure out where I'd like to put it in what type of fee-based wrapper, so to speak, that is going. If I go back sort of 10 years or so, it was really only in equities. That's where you saw most of those fee-based advice coming in. Now, that has changed. Over time, we began to talk about fixed income. Remember that had to do some of -- we would talk about fee degradation. We'd say it's not fee degradation, but it's mix and it was mixed into fixed income. Now we're seeing that mix also into alternatives. So that's what's interesting is that there are more products also being offered under the fee-based wrapper that people can begin to think about. And as those products increase, and we have more products than others, we have more tools, more opportunities to people -- for people to invest, we'll see more assets come in, there's more value to advice and there are more places to put it in when you think about the fee-based offering. So, I think that it has momentum, and as you know, those are the durable revenue streams that we expect to gain over time.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $15.4 billion in the third quarter. Our EPS was $1.88, and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results in the third quarter show the inherent strengths of our business model and our ability to grow revenues while also driving profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72%. In addition to strong revenue growth, efficiency gains are the result of disciplined prioritization of our controllable spend. An ongoing review of our real estate footprint as well as lower litigation and consulting spend contributed to this year's operating leverage while maintaining strong infrastructure to support ongoing growth. Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenues were $6.8 billion. Notwithstanding advisory and equity underwriting markets remaining below historical averages, the segment's revenues represented a near record third quarter. Performance accelerated towards the end of the quarter and was driven by the benefits of scale and the global reach of our Integrated Investment Bank. Activity outside the U.S. drove the segment's outperformance relative to historical averages. Our global footprint positioned us well to capture share. As risk events around the world drove activity, including the Bank of Japan's monetary policy changes, shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut and China's announced stimulus, we supported our clients. Investment Banking revenues increased to $1.5 billion. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued strength in underwriting, led by debt underwriting, and further aided by a pickup in advisory revenues. Steady improvements in corporate and sponsor activity as well as our investments in talent and client relationships are yielding results. Advisory revenues of $546 million increased year-over-year on modestly higher completed M&A transactions in the quarter, with particular strength in EMEA. Large fee events from closed deals in EMEA, including those involving financial sponsors, supported the strongest quarter in over a decade for the region. Equity underwriting revenues were $362 million. While global market volumes remain well below historical trend lines, revenues were higher year-over-year, with a notable pickup of activity in Asia, driven by IPOs and follow-ons. Fixed income underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior year to $555 million. Results were driven by strong non-investment grade issuance, supported by both refinancing and event-driven activity, as well as a record third quarter volumes in the investment grade market. Pipelines are healthy and diverse. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a multi-year capital markets recovery. Corporate activity is gaining momentum, and the desire among sponsors to transact is steadily materializing, not only domestically but also abroad. While we are cognizant of the broader macroeconomic risks at play, we are well-positioned to deliver the Integrated Firm with a deliberate focus on comprehensive solutions for our global clients. Equity revenues were robust at $3 billion. The business navigated bouts of market volatility well and remained nimble as we supported clients, in particular, performance in the Americas and Asia was strong. Prime brokerage revenues were above historical averages, as client balances, once again, reached a new peak, driven by higher equity markets. Cash results improved versus the prior year, reflecting higher volumes across the regions. Derivative results were also up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in client activity coupled with an improved trading environment in Asia associated with China's announced stimulus in the final weeks of September. Fixed income revenues were $2 billion, driven by strength in macro, particularly rates, largely offset by results in commodities that were stronger in the prior year. Results reflect solid performance in EMEA and Asia, as well as a coordinated global effort to support clients through periods of volatility. Macro revenues increased versus the prior year, attributed to higher client engagement as our rates business navigated the markets well amid shifting expectations around the size and the timing of the Fed's first rate cut. Micro results were roughly flat year-over-year. Results in commodities declined compared to the strong prior year, which benefited from elevated volatility in energy markets. Turning to ISG lending and provision. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $68 million, driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by an improved outlook. Net charge-offs were $100 million in the commercial real estate and corporate loans. Turning to Wealth Management. In the third quarter, the business produced a record revenue of $7.3 billion and record PBT, highlighting the model's strong operating leverage. Strength in Wealth Management reflects a combination of constructive markets and a disciplined execution of our strategy. Client assets in Wealth Management reached $6 trillion. Fee-based flows were strong, demonstrating the power of our scaled and differentiated client acquisition funnel and the value of advice. Our multichannel model is driving durable long-term growth and profitability, benefiting from continued investments in our expanded offering and technology. Moving on to our business metrics. Pre-tax profits of $2.1 billion drove the margin to 28.3%. In the quarter, DCP negatively impacted the margin by approximately 90 basis points. Asset management revenues were $4.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows and higher markets. Fee-based flows in the quarter were robust at $36 billion and year-to-date flows are on pace to exceed last year, supported by an ongoing contribution of assets from advisor-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. Clients are diversifying fee-based accounts to include fixed income and alternative products. Fee-based assets now stand at $2.3 trillion. Net new assets were $64 billion, bringing year-to-date net new assets to $195 billion, which represents 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net new assets in the quarter were supported by our advisor-led and workplace channels, with a notable contribution from new clients in the advisor-led channel. Transactional revenues were $1.1 billion, and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 10% year-over-year. Overall, higher levels of client activity supported results. Loan growth was $4 billion for the second consecutive quarter, driven by mortgages. Total deposits increased sequentially to $358 billion. While average sweeps were down slightly, the recent stabilization, particularly -- we've seen recent signs of stabilization, particularly as the Fed began cutting rates. This is encouraging. Net interest income was $1.8 billion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect NII to be modestly down from the third quarter results, largely on the back of lower rate expectations, consistent with the forward curve. We are committed to continuing to execute as the opportunity in front of us remains significant. We currently touch 19 million relationships, 1.3 million more than last year. Our expanded offering includes unique market access for high-net-worth clients across a broad range of alternative products and, more recently, robust private market services, which continues to attract demand. We are investing in our intellectual capital, unique products and an integrated infrastructure to help our advisors serve their clients. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.5 billion increased 9% compared to the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management and related fees, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM. Long-term net flows were approximately $7 billion. Inflows were primarily driven by continued demand in alternatives and solutions, and were further supported by our fixed income strategies. Since the acquisition of Eaton Vance within alternatives and solutions, Parametric customized portfolios have been a consistent source of strength. Our multi-year investments into Investment Management's partnership with Wealth Management includes initiatives around advisor education on our tax-efficient product capabilities. This has helped drive steady demand originating from our own Wealth Management clients as well as the broader retail base. Liquidity and overlay services had inflows of $9.3 billion, led by our Parametric overlay strategies. Performance-based income and other revenues were $71 million. Results supported gains in infrastructure and real estate. MSIM's total AUM now stands at $1.6 trillion. Our investments in customization and alternatives are showing returns, demonstrated by positive long-term flows this quarter. We continue to invest in secular growth products in order to meet global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets grew to $1.3 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased sequentially to $490 billion, as we actively supported clients. We accreted approximately $2 billion of Common Tier 1 capital. Our standardized CET1 ratio stands at 15.1%. We continue to deliver on our commitment to the dividend, which we raised to $0.925 per quarter in this quarter, and we bought back $750 million of common stock during the quarter. Our year-to-date results serve as hard evidence that we are executing on the opportunity set, benefiting from being global and diversified with the resources to invest in growth. Across Wealth and Investment Management, we reached $7.6 trillion of total client assets. Expanding markets and increased client engagement should further support asset growth as we progress toward $10 trillion in client assets. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Hey, good morning, Steve. Certainly. Thank you for the question, and thank you for noting the progress. We have been really focused on this over the course of the year, and I'd say that it's not -- the intention has not been to be shortsighted, but rather to take a very long-term lens as we think about efficiency. Over the course of this spring, we began to look not only at one-year budget, but really two- to three-year outlook, not just about revenues, but also understanding where are the efficiencies that we have to gain and where can we consolidate certain investments in order to make room for what would be investments in growth. I highlighted occupancy, because that's one that's notable in the SEC disclosures. You'll see that over the course of the year-to-date-to-year-to-date basis, so that line item has really only increased about $11 million. And we've made a lot of room to invest in optimization of the space, but also investments of space. You think about data centers, you think about new buildings, you think about new technology and new places that you think need to be used for occupancy. So, there is a way that we're thinking about self-funding. Same goes for a decline in professional services. Some of that was related to -- remember, we were going through many years of integration, and while we stopped disclosing on an integration basis, there were still places that we thought that we could augment what we were looking at from a professional service basis and where we were thinking about long-term gains. On the other side of that, you've seen increases in places like BC&E, because we have been in a position where we've been supporting our clients. We're also making space investing in the infrastructure as we think about the growth that we have going forward. Some of that just has to do with cyber resilience, thing that you would expect us to do as we grow the business going forward. But we're also looking at places where we're investing for FAs, new products, new technology that can give them space to go and prosecute new clients, which you see in our net new assets the course of the quarter. And broadly, as you think about risk and controls, you need to make sure that you have all of the right, like I said, infrastructure, really the foundation and the building blocks so that when you have growth, you're able to support it on a go-forward basis. So, we've been looking at it from both sides, Steve, and it is a multi-year process, and we would continue to do that not just in this business cycle and this budget cycle, but as we go forward over multiple years. Yeah. Specifically, I'd say actually all the KPIs and all the underlying is strong, sweeps being one that I called out as the deposit trends are certainly encouraging, especially since the Fed began to cut rates. We've seen that over the back end of September and even as we look into the beginning of the fourth quarter on a relative basis in terms of expectations. So, that has been positive. The underlying for me on all of the asset growth, both on NNA as well as fee-based assets, there's not one particular driver, but rather you've seen the advice-based side really picking up. You've seen clients and FAs engage. There continues to be investments into markets on a monthly level from brokerage sweeps, which you didn't see last year. So, needless to say, the markets are improving. You're seeing momentum in the economy. Uncertainties are lifting and retail clients are engaged both from seeking advice but also coming to the platform as new clients, which I think is a particularly good trend to watch. Sure. So, let me take the last part of your question first just to be clear. QT hasn't really been a driver for us. I'd say that's more for a commercial bank. So, in either direction, I don't think it has to do with a decline or an increase. So, I'd put that aside, because our deposit base is just slightly different. When we look at where we've been and the types of language that we've used historically, I'd say that just to put it in context, the rate environment has changed. It's changed since the second quarter and I'd say it's changed pretty materially. So, we don't have control as we all know in terms of where interest rates are going. What I can speak to is where we are from a deposit level. And as I said, the trends that we've seen are extremely encouraging. If you think about where we've come from and where we are over the course of the last couple of weeks, especially when the Fed -- ever since the Fed has cut interest rates. The near-term guidance that I gave is that we will likely be modestly down over the course -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And where we will be as we look into 2025, I think we will re-evaluate based on where sweeps are, one, but more importantly, on the forward, is likely where interest rates are, which will be a function of what does the Fed do in November, what does it do in December, and what is the path for '25 when we sit at the beginning of January. But I just want to put a little bit of perspective around the conversations that we've had about sweeps and NII over the course of the last couple of years. I understand that it's been a very important topic for investors, especially when you think about sweeps, in particular. But sweeps, as I said, have been, to some degree, stabilizing. And when you look at NII for Morgan Stanley, on a relative basis, think about where we were last year in the third quarter. The delta between NII this quarter and last quarter is $175 million. We make $100 million a day in this business every single day. And so, I think that we really need to begin to think about what is the model, what are we thinking about and how are we executing in the model. Asset management fee-based revenues, that increase this year, is double the decline of NII. So, we just need to gain a bit of perspective now that we see where sweeps are, that the markets are coming back and that we continue to see asset management fees rise and that is the durable revenue and what we expect to see from this business model as we move forward. Sure. Let me take them backwards, Glenn, just so I'll talk to Wealth. Wealth sees a steady -- a very small but steady increase when you look back in history associated with RWAs. And a lot of that just has to do with the lending growth. And as we think about greater household penetration, greater usage of those products by FAs and offering that to our client base, that will probably -- that's kind of where you'll see that capital allocation as we move forward. When you think about ISG though and the RWAs has been implemented in the business there, if you look at the loans and lending commitments, you'll see that where we've actually seen a lot of the growth is really on corporates. And a lot of that underlying is corporates, and all of the FSL, so the FID Secured Lending. That is inherent to the Integrated Investment Bank and the Integrated Firm. We have said over the course of the last two years that we expect this to be a Investment Banking-led recovery. We've also said and we've invested in individuals. And when you think about talent in terms of the Investment Bank more broadly, that's where you're seeing the RWAs being put to work. And that's actually also where you're seeing the results, right? That's where you're seeing an increase in DCM, an increase in different parts of the balance of fixed income coming from more lending durable financing revenue. So, it's very much alongside what we're thinking about the stabilization and the durability of the Investment Bank rather than something that's necessarily more episodic. Of course, it will ebb and flow as you see deals and transactions and that environment for those corporates, but that's how I would think about it broadly. Yeah. We continue -- as I mentioned, this is the second quarter that we've seen loan growth. I wouldn't -- we've seen stronger quarters. So, this is just the beginning. Basically, there's been a steady increase in mortgages, even though there's the rate hike cycle where it is and the rates were higher. And over time, as rates would come down, you'd expect to begin to see refinancing activity, which will spur lending. You'll also likely see, as you get into tax cycles with asset levels where they are, an increase also in SBL. So, there's -- those lending products have been relatively muted versus the historical basis. And you -- it wouldn't be surprising to begin to see more and more of that activity on the forward. Sure. So, specifically on new clients, Devin, I'd remind you a conversation that Jed had when he spoke publicly recently, which was really about what we're doing on stock plan and different ways that we're introducing FAs to new clients. We call them human referrals. It's a place where you begin to think about if someone's calling, for example, into a call center or they've come to a different event, and they'd like to actually be matched with a financial advisor. Remember, we're using technology, different parts of AI and different ways to begin to appropriately match individuals with FAs we think will suit them. That -- those human referrals are double and over 100,000 year-to-date versus what you've seen in the past. So, I think that, that's a place where we've invested in technology. We understand now how to better match and understand individuals and their needs. And we're giving them an opportunity to see the value of the advice on the forward, and that's what you're seeing in those numbers in terms of the net new assets. So, it's really bearing fruit in terms of the investments we've made. I'll take that. So, you're right to identify that there is a mix shift as we're seeing different types of flows. I'd also note, though, there are also investments being made when you think about just the expenses to help make sure that we're there to service the clients in terms of where we're seeing the secular growth trends. So, it's an asset story on Parametric. It's an asset story on alternatives. We're investing in both. Both of those are places we see secular growth trends, and we're making sure to be there with -- for our clients. Now alternatives is going to be higher fees, just basic private credit, et cetera, will be higher fees than you might see in Parametric. That being said, I don't see it simply as a fee sort of game, but rather the greater the assets, the more opportunity and the more to be the leader in the space and to continue to attract new capital to seek new opportunities. So, overall, I see it more as a strategy associated with asset building, aggregation and being there to service our clients, but also making sure that we have the capital there to invest. So, things like Parametric, you're going to need to spend money on more market data. You're going to need to build relationships with Wealth. And that's going to cost money on margin in the short term, but it will give us the opportunity for growth as we move forward over the long term. Thank you, Brennan. I appreciate that you do understand the business, and you do understand that there are multiple drivers of this business. I think what you're hitting on is that there are a lot of places that you can still see growth that is not specific only to the deposit mix. So, yes, it's encouraging to see certain pieces. Now, of course, you also had our Fed rate cut in there. So that will continue to bring the cost of certain types of deposits. You think about the beta, the beta will really depend, like you alluded to, also on products. So, things like a savings product will have a much higher beta than something like a sweeps product, which will have a much lower beta. They just -- they are two different products with two different purposes in terms of the dynamics of what they're used for. Now, on the forward, it will, of course, depend on the Fed rate path. There are so many changes that have taken place over the course of the last quarter that make it very difficult to say, well, where will the Fed be, and where will be those investment opportunities. So, where I would sort of point to is there are three pieces that we've always talked about that will drive NII. Two of them are encouraging. That's the growth on the asset side in terms of where you're seeing us being able to actually deploy the capital, where you're seeing people ask for lending opportunities, et cetera, it's growing, it's encouraging. Sweeps, what we know and what we've seen, especially since the first rate cut, is also very encouraging, particularly as historically, if you look back, and I said this in the last quarter call, generally speaking, when you begin to see interest rate cuts, you do begin to see different parts of deposits rise. So, again, an encouraging sign. Where will it be when you think about reinvestment and the rest of NII? That in and of itself is really the Fed. And if we go back a quarter ago, no one -- it was a very low probability to see a 50 basis point rate cut, and lo and behold, we have one. So, why don't we see where we are after the November and December meetings and then restate kind of where we think we'll be over the course of the year just from a rate perspective. But those three building blocks, you know what they are and you know that the two that are under our control or they have to do sort of -- I wouldn't say, under our control, but rather have to do with what our clients are doing. I've told you what I'm seeing from our data, and it's all positive. No, I actually -- thank you for the question. I don't think that it's more mature with less upside. I actually think there's more upside to go when you think about the penetration of FAs using those products. So, we used to be sort of in the low-double-digits in terms of that penetration. That's moved up to somewhere in the teens. But we do think that there's opportunity to surpass that higher. And if you look sort of at peers even in similar kinds of channels, so not lending through a commercial bank, but more on the wealth side, those numbers are higher. So, there are certainly opportunities there, Christian. So that's why I appreciate you asking the question. I wouldn't say it's not just on the mortgage side. That certainly can come back. But SBLs have been relatively flat. And it's not surprising. We've talked a lot about the uses of those lines. And especially if rates are low, thinking about how to use those lines to pay taxes, for example, and think about what you're doing from an efficiency perspective with your portfolio as an individual investor. Sure. So, why don't we just -- I'll take it to sort of, I guess, together but answer it slightly backwards, which is we talked about different pricing changes. And last quarter, we also said that, that was a small portion in terms of where the changes are going to be made. So, it's small. It's in the run rate. You saw it over the course of the quarter, and it was in the results. When we think about deposit pricing, we take a number of factors into consideration. And one of the most important factors that we highlighted last quarter and we've been looking at even through this cutting cycle are competitive dynamics and where competitive pricing is. So that's -- it's the market, and it's also competition. It's the need for deposits and it's where that is on a relative value perspective. So, all of those things that include the customer as well. Sure. Those are largely provisioned for. And so, I think what you've seen is that it's almost as though some of the credit changes have been working themselves through the market. If you look back over the course of the last two years, we've had a lot of conversations, Gerard, specifically talking about CRE. You've had some great questions as it relates to that space. We saw that, that was happening. We provisioned for it. And over time, you will see that likely come through on the other side as charge-offs, and that's kind of where we are at this point in the cycle. Sure. I'll take it because we continue to do work with OpenAI. In terms of where we are overall on the technology side, Mike, you saw a lot of our products very early, say, almost 10 years ago at this point in time when we did our first tech expo. And we looked at tools that we were using AI and different types of machine learning, et cetera, to give our advisors tools to give them more time to prospect business. As it relates specifically to that partnership, that partnership is going extremely well. We continue to look at new platforms and new applications that we can use with them. And there are new places that we're using AI that we've launched and we've discussed over the course of the last two quarters or so. One is, we, obviously, do have a tool where FAs can use and speak to our research portal, so to speak, and understand that AI will basically read everything and then can help you answer different questions associated with what's already been published in terms of that volume of data. In addition to that, as we've moved forward, we can have tools like debrief where an individual, of course, gaining permission in a meeting can use what they've heard in a meeting through AI translate languages, et cetera, summarize and then be able to send out emails as follow-ups based on the conversations had in those meetings with a draft. Obviously, you have human interaction after in a human overlay, but just gives you the bare bones again to save time for the advisors as we move forward. We're doing that across the institution in different pockets and spaces as part of the -- if we think back to the efficiency work that we started this call with, there will be places where we can use AI to also think through efficiencies. So, it's a balance of understanding where to invest and then how to use that to gain time back from a productivity perspective as we move forward. Yeah. I actually really appreciate the question. I appreciate that you took note of the comments that I gave in the prepared remarks, which is what we've been focused on is really migration and understanding migration of assets. So, we look at -- there's brokerage accounts in self-directed, and there's brokerage accounts when you think about on the advisor side. You have an advisor, but you also have a brokerage account, and not everything is in fee-based. The numbers from brokerage is -- those numbers are increasing in terms of what's actually migrating into fee-based. And why I think that's important is we've always said that we would expect -- oftentimes, the way you see net new assets come into the institution, they come in maybe under an advisor or not. But let's say you're in the advisor side, it comes into a brokerage account first. It doesn't go directly into fee-based. And so, it's really the migration of assets coming in and then seeing that pick up, say, oh, I understand that there's a value to advice, and let me now figure out where I'd like to put it in what type of fee-based wrapper, so to speak, that is going. If I go back sort of 10 years or so, it was really only in equities. That's where you saw most of those fee-based advice coming in. Now, that has changed. Over time, we began to talk about fixed income. Remember that had to do some of -- we would talk about fee degradation. We'd say it's not fee degradation, but it's mix and it was mixed into fixed income. Now we're seeing that mix also into alternatives. So that's what's interesting is that there are more products also being offered under the fee-based wrapper that people can begin to think about. And as those products increase, and we have more products than others, we have more tools, more opportunities to people -- for people to invest, we'll see more assets come in, there's more value to advice and there are more places to put it in when you think about the fee-based offering. So, I think that it has momentum, and as you know, those are the durable revenue streams that we expect to gain over time. Thank you."

            "name": "Ted Pick",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered strong revenues of $15.4 billion, $3 billion of net income and a 17.5% return on tangible. The results reflect top-line growth across our businesses and demonstrate operating leverage. Year-to-date results reflect the firm's ability to generate consistent quarterly performance, $15 billion of revenues, sequential EPS of $2.02, $1.82, and $1.88, and year-to-date returns on tangible of 18%. Across the firm, we advanced toward our strategic goals while continuing to invest in growth. We are delivering on asset aggregation by leveraging our unique platform and scale in Wealth and Investment Management. Through the first nine months, we achieved $200 billion of organic growth. It's worth noting that over the last year, total client assets are up almost $1.4 trillion. Total client assets across Wealth and Investment Management have now reached $7.6 trillion, on the road to $10 trillion. Our strategic investments across the Integrated Investment Bank are reflected through share gains in our Institutional franchise. The breadth and depth of our global team working seamlessly across all three regions was evident through the summer and post Labor Day, as we helped clients navigate volatility against economic and policy uncertainty. As a whole, the Integrated Firm is achieving operating leverage with our year-to-date efficiency ratio improving by approximately 300 basis points to 72%. We have achieved this while continuing to thoughtfully invest across business and infrastructure priorities. Institutional and individual clients are engaged and we are well-positioned to capture opportunities against different market condition backdrops. Strong fee-based flows in Wealth and the strong performance in Institutional Securities speak to clients seeking Morgan Stanley's advice. Improved underwriting markets combined with increasing participation among financial sponsors and corporates across Investment Banking support a constructive outlook. A broadening equity market and evolving interest rate policy are favorable backdrops for our markets businesses. Continued individual client focus on tax customization strategies are a tailwind for our Parametric business inside Investment Management. Now, with three quarters of 2024 on the board, we are striking a cadence that we will execute against. Our team is unified across the four pillars of: strategy, culture, financial strength and growth. Morgan Stanley's strategy is to raise, manage and allocate capital for institutions and individuals. We will continue to execute on this strategy with a culture of rigor, humility and partnership. And with high levels of capital and liquidity, Morgan Stanley will continue to execute on a plan of durable growth across our Integrated Firm. Sharon will now take us through the quarter. Nice job, SY. Good morning, Steve. Hey, Ebrahim. Thanks for the question. As you know, we're at 15.1% CET1. The new number is 13.5%. So, our buffer is 160 basis points. We like that buffer. It gives us room to operate. You saw that we had some risk-weighted asset increase, but we still managed to keep the ratios at 15%-plus. So, there's a story here, which is to continue to price best-in-class financial strength along the lines of capital and liquidity, but also to lean into the businesses as the market opportunity affords. We did that clearly in both businesses. You saw it in the Investment Bank, where we gained share across the primary and both markets businesses, but you also saw it in Wealth Management, some of the technology spend that Sharon described. In the sort of forced hierarchy of what we would wish to do at any given moment around capital allocation, as we said before, it's the dividend first that is sacrosanct and we continue to grow it. Second here, because of the secular growth and where we are in the cycle, as Sharon just described, there is a good cause to be investing in all three segments, Wealth Management, Investment Management and the Investment Bank, and to do so across the world. We're clearly seeing rates of equitization increasing in places like Japan and India and on the continent. So, having a global franchise and investing in that, we think is existentially important. And then, the buyback is opportunistic. We'll be buying back $3 billion-plus this year, as that's an ongoing lever that we're going to pull. Of course, the Basel uncertainty likely lasts through the election and we have our points of advocacy that are aligned with the industry, but also those things that matter very much to Morgan Stanley specifically. And we're going to continue to make our case concertedly, respectfully, and we'll see how it plays out after the election. But as it stands now, 160 basis points of buffer on CET1, 5.5% SLR, we are investing in the business, we're achieving operating leverage. So, these things are always a movable feast, but we are keeping a very close eye on it and we're happy with how we're optimizing the allocation. Hey, Glenn. Yeah. What I'd add to that is what is important, too, as you look through the metrics, Glenn, is that the revenues in the Investment Bank are up 20% year-over-year and roughly flat down 2% sequentially, but in that same period, the trading bar, the value of risk across the Investment Bank is running flattish. And that is -- in fact, it's slightly down. So, we were able to put up some real operating leverage without taking up the underlying measured risk in the business, which speaks to sort of the type of durable revenue model that Sharon described across our Integrated Investment Bank. Hi, Devin. Good morning, Dan. The Integrated Investment Bank premise that we built over the last 10 years and really intensified over the last five years was that it takes a real local commitment to have a global investment bank. We've made real investments on the continent, for example, in Iberia, in Italy, in France. We continue to be the largest presence actually as tenancy matter in Canary Wharf, so in the UK. So, our European commitment is real across both Investment Banking and increasingly in the markets business. That's in the Investment Bank. But also we have a thriving Investment Management business, LPs, who are well ensconced on the continent, and we're building that integrated capability with alternative solutions and the like. We have been strong, as you know, in Asia for really decades. And that spoke to the power of a global investment banking institution that when we had disruptive events, as Sharon alluded to, in Tokyo and then in China in the last couple of months leading into this quarter, it was important that we have a leading investment banking and markets presence, both in Japan and in Hong Kong and Mainland. So here, the seamless execution will pay off as cross-border M&A intensifies as parts of the world outside of the U.S., where, of course, we have our concentrated bet as a regional matter, to the point you were asking, you see good growth in revenues both in Asia and in Europe. You saw year-over-year growth of almost 25% for the firm in EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and then 30%-plus in Asia. That speaks to having a local presence such that when the Investment Banking cycle really kicks in and companies wish to engage in strategic activity, which includes, obviously, getting bigger or making a sale and potentially go public locally that we're going to have the kind of presence to transact. So, running the global investment bank is going to pay for years to come. And I would add, by the way, that an important part culturally of what we've done at Morgan Stanley for many years which is bearing fruit, is to mobilize some of our senior talent from one region to another, not just across businesses but across regions, which is important when you have 30 of your 80,000 people outside the United States that they're familiar with our operations in places like India and Budapest. Good morning, Brennan. Well, as you know, the sponsors have roughly $1.3 trillion of dry powder. They have $3 trillion to $4 trillion of portfolio companies in the ground by some measures, 10,000 companies in the ground. And for the first time in close to 15 years there, the deployment is outpacing the fundraising. So, there is a need for that group to move. And they act as a liquidity source, but they also act as a competitive player to our traditional corporate community. I think much has been said about the barriers to entry to be a highly regulated [indiscernible] public company. But I would take the view that there are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets. That currency allows them to make acquisitions, to set up long-term compensation plans and like, to go global. So, what I'd expect to see are larger companies going public, having been private for some time, reaching a level that makes them a tougher sale on the private front. There are private alternatives, but the going-public phenomenon is not going away. And I made reference to this earlier, I think there is a going-public phenomenon that will exist around the world, whether it's select countries doing privatizations, whether it's exciting companies that for the first time are reaching global benchmarks. So, I think we're going to see the IPO market slowly work its way back, larger names coming to market. And then, when they do, quite quickly needing the full service suite of a global investment bank, needing the treasury capabilities, needing hedging services, needing the kind of advice at a mid- or large-cap mature company needs, and that, of course, on a global scale is right in our sweet spot. So, I'm bullish on IPOs and M&A coming back. It may take some time. And the size of the companies when they come will be likely larger. So, there will be slower unit volume than the sort of the heyday of post-COVID stimulus and quick listings, but I think these are going to be global mature companies which are going to very much need our advice. Good morning, Christian. Good morning, Gerard. Well, I think the question is an interesting one because the barriers to entry to scaling a new asset manager are quite high. But we host, as you're aware, our cap intro conference every January down in Breakers. We've done that for decades and continue to draw enormous demand to try to get a slot. Because once you've made it, the platform economics of success and your ability to penetrate various distribution channels enables you to get big quite quickly. So, it's sort of tough to make it, but once you've made it, you can really scale into a large institution. By and large, though, the growth that we've seen across equities to hit the $3 billion mark over the last couple of quarters you've seen has not been consuming additional VAR. It's just staying close to our clients. These results indicate that we've increased wallet with predominantly the existing base. We've done that around the world. And the leverage levels for a lot of these clients in the quantum platform space are actually run close to the typical range for that subgroup. So, we've been able to interact with them in a productive way across not just prime brokerage, but cash and derivatives, too, and then importantly, across the markets business. So, this is part of this Integrated Investment Bank philosophy that you can have folks that are traditional players in one pocket moving across the asset spectrum, and the leadership in the market business has done a great job facilitating that, not just across underliers, but as I mentioned in the past quarter, across regions. And to the extent that there are spin-outs or others, we have a vibrant business now in the Middle East too, in Abu Dhabi, and in Scandinavia in Copenhagen. Those are the two offices we recently opened. And I mentioned them because they are not just great possible for Investment Banking and for our Investment Management business, but they're also very interesting for our markets business, too. Good morning, Mike. And I also like the -- I like the question because it suggests that there are going to be opportunities where being a fast follower is just fine, where you can take existing capability and make the digitization process easier on a straight cost effectiveness play, where -- to Sharon's comments, where we are really digging in as a, call it, proprietary matter is around the productive efficiency inside of Wealth Management. This entire -- we call it AIMS, as you know, AI @ Morgan Stanley. The AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant is just the first chapter of what we're going to do across the financial advisor platform specific to our own offering with clients where we think we're going to have some real edge. At our place? Well, it's going to be a tool at the very least that is going to help inform FAs on what is relevant at any given moment under any different -- any given paradigm. They are going to have access to information across a whole bunch of data sets, ongoing conversations and interactions that are going to allow for crisper and more effective conversations with their clients. I think that will take some time to play out. But when you think about it, extraordinarily effective in terms of the interactions when there will be heightened proclivity to activity between the client and the FA, whether it's around an exogenous event or a life event for the FA to be well-equipped to know what types of products and services might be available down the road is something that we think will be part of the embedded offering. Saul, good morning."

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimers. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\nTed Pick: Good morning and thank you for joining us. The firm generated $15 billion in revenue, $1.82 in EPS, and a 17.5% return on tangible in the second quarter. [Solid earnings] (ph) and demonstration of operating leverage completes a strong first half of 2024. $30 billion in revenue, $6 billion in earnings, and an 18.6% return on capital. In institutional securities, we're beginning to see the benefits from our continued focus on our world-class investment banking franchise, with revenues up 50% year-over-year, including a 70% increase year-over-year in fixed income underwriting. In institutional equities, we are back with a $3 billion quarter. In wealth, we posted margins of 27%, and across wealth and investment management, we've now grown total client assets to $7.2 trillion on our road to $10 trillion plus. Together, we delivered strong operating leverage. Further, on the back of the annual stress test results, we announced that we will increase the dividend by $0.075 for the third year in a row to [$0.925] (ph), reflecting the growth of our durable earnings over time. During the quarter, we built $1.5 billion of capital, and at quarter end, our CET1 ratio is 15.2%, 170 basis points above the forward requirement. Our capital position provides us the flexibility to continue to support dividend growth, support our clients, and buy the stock back opportunistically. The quarter also showed continued balance in both top-line and profitability across the major segments. Wealth and institutional securities produced $6.8 billion and $7 billion in revenue respectively, with earnings also roughly split between our institutional businesses and wealth and investment management. Our businesses are working closely together to maximize adjacent opportunities across the integrated firm. Across the investment bank, navigating changes in the cycle means being deliberate around risk management and, given geopolitical uncertainty, where we spend our time to deliver clients, solutions, and to capture share. In wealth management, we continue to focus on aggregating assets and delivering strong advice. In investment management, we are investing in secular growth areas, including customization and real assets. Year-to-date, annualized growth in net new assets and wealth management is over 5%, with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows. Strong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which on average continues to be about $100 million each day this year throughout and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise. We are well navigating the continued uncertainty around forward rate path, geopolitics, and now the US Political cycle and expect those to be the themes for the balance of the year. We remain focused on our best-in-class talent and building out best-in-class infrastructure to support ongoing growth across wealth and investment management and institutional securities. I wanted to reiterate our strategy, which is clear to advise individuals and institutions around the world in raising, managing, and allocating capital. World-class execution demands that we deliver strong earnings and returns through the cycle, that we do so while maintaining robust capital levels, and that we deliver on a durable growth narrative across the segments. And then Morgan Stanley executes on this strategy in a first-class way [Blue] (ph). That's it in a nutshell. And finally, in reflecting on this weekend's assassination attempt, we share in the hope that in the months to come, we will as Americans, find ways to unify and preserve our better selves. With that, Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.\nSharon Yeshaya : Thank you and good morning. In the second quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15 billion. Our EPS was $1.82 and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results highlight the power and scale of our integrated firm. The resilience of the US economy and a more stable near-term outlook on rates supported conviction amongst clients. Institutional securities drove performance, led by strength and equity and a pickup in investment banking. Wealth management also delivered on our established strategy, reporting record durable asset management fees and strong fee-based flows. Together, improved confidence and higher client engagement along with our focus on prioritizing investments, yielded operating leverage, and profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72% benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base. Year-to-date expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses, the absence of back office integration related costs and severance, as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend. On prioritization, we remain committed to client and asset growth, technology, and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion increased 23% versus last year, capturing the strengths of the integrated investment bank across US, and international markets. Higher activity in Asia contributed to results. Strong performance in institutional equity, as well as debt underwriting, demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise. In our markets business, opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data. Investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. The 51% increase from the prior year was broad-based. We continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending, broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors, including financials, healthcare, technology, and industrials. These investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up. Advisory revenues were $592 million, reflecting an increase in our completed M&A activity versus the prior year. The pre-announced M&A backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors. Equity underwriting revenues of $352 million improved versus the prior year, driven by increases across most products, but remain below historical averages. From a geographical perspective, we brought a number of transactions to market in Europe and Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $675 million, well above five-year historical averages. Results reflect a meaningful pickup in non-investment grade loan and bond issuance, as tighter spreads and strong CLO issuance provided opportunities for refinancing. The investment banking backdrop continues to improve, led by the US, the advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors. Inflation data has continued to moderate, which has helped stabilize front-end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor reengagement. As buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap, we expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. Subject to changes in [rate past] (ph) expectations and geopolitical developments, our integrated investment bank is well-positioned to service our clients. Turning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Equity revenues of over $3 billion, up 18% compared to last year, reflect strong results across business and regions. Higher client engagement, dynamic risk management, and strength in Asia all contributed to performance. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year as client balances reached new peaks. Regionally, we witnessed higher client activity in Asia and seasonal patterns in Europe. Cash results increased versus last year, reflecting higher volumes across regions. Derivative results were up versus last year's second quarter as client activity was higher and the business navigated the market environment well. Further, the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances, additional evidence of the integrated firm at work. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion increased year-over-year. Macro performance was up versus the prior year. Despite lower realized volatility, clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter. Micro results improved year-over-year, driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions. Solid results in commodities were in-line with the prior year. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $54 million, driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs were $48 million, primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions. Turning to Wealth Management. Wealth Management generated strong results generating revenues of $6.8 billion with record asset management fees. Our PBT margin continued to make progress towards our goal, demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle. We are delivering on our differentiated, scaled multichannel asset gathering strategy. Wealth Management client assets reached $5.7 trillion. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Pretax profit was $1.8 billion up year-over-year with a reported margin of 26.8%. DCP negatively impacted our margin by approximately 100 basis points. The margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our asset gathering strategy. We are improving the efficiency with which we run the business. Asset management revenues of $4 billion were up 16%. That is more than $500 million in fees versus the prior year. It's driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows. In the quarter, fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over $20 billion, bringing the year-to-date fee-based flows to $52 billion. We are seeing a steady migration of assets from adviser-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying-off. Fee-based assets now stand at $2 trillion. Net new assets were $36 billion reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date, net new assets are $131 billion representing 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business specific factors. We believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high net worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still our first half NNA growth remains solid. Transactional revenues were $782 million. Excluding the impact of DCP revenues were up 5% versus last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity-related transactions. Bank lending balances grew by $4 billion to $151 billion evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes, our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs. Total deposits of $343 billion remains stable, with sweep deposits down approximately $10 billion sequentially mostly offset by growth in CDs. Net interest income was down modestly to $1.8 billion reflecting the decline in sweeps, which was largely attributable to the seasonality of tax payments. The Wealth Management business continued to perform well, aggregating assets, generating fees and benefiting from scale and our differentiated offering, consistently earning approximately $100 million a day. In the third quarter, we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates against the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics. The impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio. Therefore third quarter NII will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps, and NII could decline modestly in the third quarter. Importantly inclusive of these pricing changes, the rate path and our expectations around client behavior, we believe that NII should inflect higher as you look out into next year. Our Wealth Management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs and offering advice. Asset management fees, the core of our Wealth Management strategy, continues to produce strong results reaching a record this quarter. Taken together, we delivered a strong margin, and we continue to work towards 30% margins over time. This quarter, we reached approximately $19 million in relationships across our three channels, and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement. AI tools are helping advisers grow, and Wealth Management's partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering. These investments have supported flows to our adviser-led channel, where average client duration is nearly 15 years and growing. The steady progress supports our journey towards $10 trillion-plus in total client assets. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.4 billion increased 8% from the prior second quarter, supported by higher asset management revenue. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion up 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher average AUM. Total AUM ended the quarter at $1.5 trillion. Performance-based income and other revenues were $44 million as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure, US private credit and US private equity funds, reflecting our investments in secular growth areas. We recorded long-term net outflows of approximately $1 billion. We continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus, namely Parametric. Consistent with current industry trends, we saw outflows in our active equity strategies. Our business is well-positioned given strength in areas of secular growth, such as customization, direct indexing and private alternatives. Our continued focus on global distribution combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities, should support incremental growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $16 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%. Client activity was strong and markets were open. We actively supported clients with a focus on velocity of resources. We also grew our CET1 capital by $1.5 [billion] (ph), reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution. The most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position. For the third year in a row, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075. Having generated over $3.85 of earnings per share and an 18.6% ROTCE year-to-date, we enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, with a robust capital base to support clients. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy and diverse, dialogues are active and markets are open. In Wealth Management, strong fee-based flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working. As capital markets become more active, we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash and cash equivalent balances into fee-based products. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: We are now ready to take any questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there. Thank you.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Glenn.\nGlenn Schorr: Good morning. Sharon, I appreciate all the upfront commentary on NII and Wealth. I wanted to drill down a little bit on what you said. So if you have $2 trillion in client assets in advisory and they keep a handful of percent of money in cash, that change you are making in rate paid on advisory -- on deposit in advisory accounts, can add up to like a good amount of money. So I wanted to get a little more sharper focus on what you said about 2025 NII? And then what exactly did you say the offset is on the NII? Thanks.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. Thanks, Glenn for the question. Actually, the portion that -- of the sweep balances that are impacted are as you mentioned, the sweep on the adviser-led channel, which is actually a small portion of the overall BDP that we disclose. So it\u2019s a small portion of that overall stack. And the increase in pricing is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio, right? So as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices, it's that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: And is there a particular reason why you only have to focus on repricing in this smaller portion than of the adviser-led channel, meaning not --.\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. Yes, what I would note there is that what we think about -- when we think about sweeps, broadly is mainly in transactional accounts. And in those transactional accounts, we have a wide range of choices and products for our clients. And so therefore, they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi, good morning.\nTed Pick: Good morning Ebrahim.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning Ted. Just maybe sticking with NII and more importantly, on pretax margin, right? You had an extremely strong quarter. The stock's weaker this morning, and it has to do with the NII drag on wealth revenues and margin. So one I think, Sharon, your level of visibility into NII, lots of moving pieces around client behavior, maybe we get interest rate cuts. Just give us a sense of, if history is any guide on, what rate cuts would imply for client behavior? Or is there cash to assets that you are looking at that gives you comfort around NII potentially stabilizing post 3Q? And then maybe a question -- go ahead, yes.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. So why don't I take that, and then you can ask your second question. So you are pointing at a great point Ebrahim, as we look ahead through time, which was the second point of my guidance, is that when we look over the next year, we\u2019re seeing and we expect that we should see an inflection in NII. And that is predicated on the points that you mentioned, which is that as you see rate cuts, we would expect those balances to stabilize. Remember, outside of the tax quarter this particular quarter, we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits. So it's important to recognize that, that has been happening, reaching that frictional level of transactional cash. So that would likely continue. And then over time, you would also begin to see a benefit as rates to be cut, that BDP could actually see inflows, which you've seen from a historical perspective. But in addition to that, you have two other factors. One is the repricing of the portfolio, which I've also already mentioned. And the second piece has to do with lending. We look to continue to support our clients with lending products, and you are beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection. This is the first quarter that we've seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began. We've seen now use of SBL products rather than just it being offset by paydowns. So those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for NII.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s helpful. And I guess my second question was, just talking to investors, when we look at the 30% pretax margin target, the question is whether this is aspirational, whether the bar is set too high given how competitive the business is. So remind us in terms of your comfort level on the 30% pretax margin, to the extent you can, the time-line of when we get there? And when we get there, should that be a sustainable pace for the business? Thanks.\nTed Pick: Thanks, Ebrahim. Confidence level, high. If you take a step back, there are three pieces to the Wealth Management line; asset management, transactional, net interest income, as you know. In the asset management context, those are fees that are going to fee-based accounts, advisory-led. Those figures are up 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. That is fee-paying advice. Last quarter, the net new assets into that category was $26 billion. So fee-based flows -- that continues to be a growth piece of the Wealth Management store. The second cylinder is transactional. Transactional has been relatively weak, which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity. And as you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank, that will bleed through over time to the transactional line. And then third, the net interest income line. And as Sharon said, that will inflect and should inflect over the next year. You put those together, the scale of the business, the funnel, and the processing of $100 million of revenues a day that continue to grow, we are going to continue to achieve operating leverage. It's that simple. We're investing in E*TRADE. We're investing in the traditional advisor, and we're spending a lot of time top of house focused on workplace, which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base. In January, I had said 30% was the goal. We were in the mid-20s. We just printed 27% GAAP, 28% [Ex-CPE] (ph). It's a core stated objective. It will take some quarters to get there, but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nTed Pick: Good morning Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hi, Ted, you've said this and Sharon repeated this that the industry is only in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. I have to say we've heard that for a couple of years and there now is this time, why is this time real? Do you expect the rebound to continue through the normally slow summer period before the election? How many years? What gives you confidence that this is for real? And how much is your backlog up quarter-over-quarter?\nTed Pick: It's an excellent question because you're exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this and it has been sort of a delayed shoots if you will. But I think now we are seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates. We are also beginning along with that to see the market broaden-out. You of course have seen that over the last number of weeks. And I think, we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken, whether that is across the corporate community or sponsors or other institutions. And the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product. Global convertibles activity is up significantly. And as you know, on the margin ladder, it typically goes converts, IPO, and then M&A. In the context of bake-offs and the like, in some spaces we are seeing bake-offs running at triple plus the year-over-year rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups. We've been seeing now the launch of traditional IPOs and we are seeing M&A pipeline kicking in. So corporate community, sponsor community, cross-border community, I think we are in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking-led cycle. If you believe the economy is going to hold up led by the US, you should expect then to see that if there is some regulatory normalization too across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active. So we are quite convicted on this call.\nMike Mayo: And just one pushback, I mean with interest rates, you know, so much higher than they've been in the past. Don't you think that could get in the way when people are looking to borrow money for deals and the like? Is this a matter of simply waiting for rates to go lower? Or that's not going to get in the way?\nTed Pick: I mean it's a fair question. You've written about this in the context of what was the normal before financial repression, right? And I would take the view that in the context of the last 15 years, even some normalization, because I don't know that we are going to go into a full-blown rate cycle to your point, some normalizations of rates will still have you at 3% or 4% on the front-end and even some steepening potentially. So now we are just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of mid-90s in most normal economic periods. And the game will have to go on because there is just been some activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure percentage of asset stock percentage of market cap. And the stickiness that we are seeing in the sponsor community, too needs to unglue. There is an enormous, as you know multitrillion-dollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder that's been raised. That will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another. So in short, unless you were to tell me we are going to go into a full-blown recession, which none of us can call, and that even if we saw rates normalize to something that is along the lines of the historic 4% on the front end, I think you will see over the next number of quarters and really over the next number of years, a resumption of more normalized M&A activity, with the key difference being that the financial sponsor community is now institutionally come of age. They have global reach. They can work the entire capital structure. They will work in concert with corporate partners, as you know. They don't actually have to act as a lone wolves, and they can work with us to finance the package. So it is not just the straight M&A advise or the straight IPO, it would also be bespoke offerings in the private public space, interest rate and foreign exchange hedging and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring. And this is really why, over the last couple of years, the extent we've done a so-called front-office hiring, it really has been to target several very high-quality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the Morgan Stanley platform. And we are seeing the fruits of that across industries. So I am quite bullish on it. Certainly take your point that has been a number of quarters on sort of on the promise. But I think as we get into 2025 and the election coming and then the election behind us, we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTed Pick : Good morning Dan.\nDan Fannon: Thanks good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the flows in the quarter within Wealth, maybe the breakdown from the channels and contribution. Last quarter, I think we saw a Family Office be an outsized contributor. But hoping to get a little bit more color on where the flows were sourced in 2Q.\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I'll take that. It's -- we continue to see broad-based sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from. In this particular quarter, as I mentioned the biggest offset and drag though, is really from taxes. So it's -- you still have a workplace accounts. You still have the advice-based account directly. You still have self-directed. All those places remain contributors. What continues in my mind to be most interesting though, isn't just the contribution that you are getting from the three various channels, but the fact that you have in the advice-based channel, it's not just coming from existing clients, but it's split with existing and net new clients. And some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace. So I would not just directly focus on what channel is it coming from, but how are you seeing those channel in that interplay work, because that's actually the power of the differentiated platform. Once you have somebody who wants more differentiated advice for self-directed speaks to an advisor, that advisor sees net new clients, bring in assets, and then that's new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee-based. So it's really the whole ecosystem that I would call your attention to, rather than just one isolated leg.\nTed Pick: Which is part of the reason that workplace is so important, because at workplace, I can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth, and then potentially other products around it. So it can be an indirect sale where you aren't necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the FA, but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace where we do a great job educating on wellness -- financial wellness and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the Morgan Stanley Solium product and having succeeded on an MS at work mandate, which, as you know is a durable, sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base, you can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that front.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTed Pick : Good morning Brennan.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning Ted. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just drill down a little more to give the second follow-up here on the repricing change that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Sharon. So the repricing that we've seen in the securities book has been slow. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you think that will help offset the repricing actions that you are taking on the deposit side. Is that because it will be a phased repricing, and therefore there is an ability to have the phased benefit in the asset side offset? And then just a nitty-gritty question on it, is the switch going to be to money fund sweep rather than higher yielding deposits, and then that way you can just slowly replace that funding as you see [fit] (ph)?\nSharon Yeshaya: So thanks, Brennan, I'll take that question. No, all the changes that we'll make will happen, are expected to happen in the third quarter. And so those different changes will be made, and they'll be based on various competitive dynamics.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Got it. And then is the -- is this going to be focused on the advisory relationship similar to what we've seen from some other wirehouse competitors? And could you just -- is it the changes that have been announced by Wells and BofAs, is that what you mean by competitive dynamics? Or is there something else that I'm not aware of?\nSharon Yeshaya: That's exactly as I stated it, and it will just be limited as you said, to the sweeps that are dealt within the advisor-led channel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nTed Pick : Good morning Devin.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning Sharon and hi. The first question, just on -- another one on the GWM flows. Sharon, you mentioned tax season is a factor, which you completely get. But then you also mentioned increased client spending. And I just wanted to drill into that, just whether that's something that could continue, whether it was seasonal or influenced by inflation? Just trying to understand that component of the impact on flows.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. I think that's a really interesting question. I did call it out. We've seen increased spending by higher net worth, and so higher income bands are certainly spending. We see that in the data alongside actual spending. We see that in purchases of homes. We see that in various tailored investments. So they are -- that cohort, so to speak, is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways. So I do think that -- that's an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well. It's only something we are seeing in our data.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up just on the interplay between Investment Banking and Trading, and I appreciate the commentary on kind of the improving capital markets backdrop, which is great to hear and kind of the expectation from our end that there's going to be a lot more primary issuance in equities, maybe in debt as well as M&A picks up. So just trying to think about what that means for the trading businesses, equities and fixed income and whether you guys feel like we could maybe sustain around these really high levels or even maybe -- even the wallet could move higher just as you get a stronger primary issuance market?\nTed Pick: Well, I know that competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset. Here, we have -- we believe, something really special inside of our Institutional Securities business, our so-called integrated investment bank, which has been ongoing for -- now we are getting on seven or eight years. Now under Dan Simkowitz's direction. And this is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income, equities and banking through our capital markets new issue business. You have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another. So there is real familiarity now with the work product. A lot of the work product, as you know, is not traditional vanilla IPOs. Yes. There are some on the horizon that are quite substantial, and we'd expect that to be an important part of the calendar. But there is also a more bespoke product, whether it be convertibles or products in the private area or products that effectively necessitate high-quality structuring and advice, and that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have world-class investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues, not just in the new issue business but as appropriate, in institutional equities and in fixed income. And if you look at our fixed income business, for example and fixed income underwriting, you'll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary. And that the year-over-year revenue number, I believe is up 71%. That speaks to the fine work that's been done by folks, not just in the debt capital markets business which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking, but also working closely with fixed income professionals, whether they are in the securitized products group and our commodities area broader credit or in our macro space, i.e., interest rate and foreign exchange. So when you get into the knitting of ISG, our Integrated Investment Bank, you see that part of the reason that we are bullish, not just to Mike's earlier question on the denominator, but also on our ability to increase the numerator, is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital. We will do so as appropriate when the markets demand it. But that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that comes from the familiarity of our people, the quality of the advice that is differentiated and importantly, that it's global, so that we can bring it to the client base. So that is part of, I think, the secret sauce that we've been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns, inside the investment bank on a stand-alone basis. And that obviously doesn't include even the synergies that we'd see across the Firm into Wealth and Investment Management. But your question is on the investment bank specifically. And I feel really good about the way it's structured, the leadership that we have within it, the experience set, and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle which will be different than the last one. Rates will be well higher than that of financial repression. We'll be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession. We'll be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle, US election cycle, but the world around us. But also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community, where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the Investment Bank, Wealth and Investment Management.\nOperator: For our next question, we'll move to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nTed Pick: Good morning Steve.\nSteven Chubak: So maybe just starting off with a question just on operating leverage within ISG. Year-to-date, the incremental margins are quite strong, just north of 80%. You spoke constructively on IB and Trading and inflecting positively. Just want to better understand what you believe is a sustainable incremental margin as activity steadily builds especially given some of the growth, at least from here, may skew a bit more heavily towards Investment Banking, which tends to be more compensable.\nSharon Yeshaya: So when you look at it, I would really focus Steve, on the efficiency ratio targets that we put for the whole firm, right? We think that the firm can run at or below the 70% over time through a durable cycle. The issue with your specific question, as you yourself highlighted is, it depends on where those different revenues are coming from. So there might be periods of time where it's higher BC&E related, there might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it. But broadly speaking, the enterprise we've given 30% margins as it relates to Wealth and the sort of Wealth and Investment Management space, and then you have the ISG space. So by definition, if you're running at 70% efficiency ratio more broadly, you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a 30% margin.\nTed Pick: Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is, of course as you know, there is real seasonality in the business. Fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter, street-wide in the first quarter, Investment Banking typically in the fourth quarter. That's not every year, but that's typically out shakes out. Third quarter tends to be weaker in the summer months, and then it's sort of all about September. And obviously, this September will be one that will be driven in part by sentiment around the upcoming elections. So that's kind of the seasonality piece. The other is just the scale within the businesses, I'd be remiss again, not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached $3 billion in the equities business. This has been a leading business where we have been Number 1 and Number 2 for the last dozen years. And we see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash, derivatives and prime brokerage. And then connecting to Investment Banking, I think that business has too hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute high-margin business through the cycle. All of this, of course is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels. But given where we are right now, we are feeling good about that, too.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that perspective. And just a follow-up on the deposit discussion. Both you and your wirehouse peers announced similar actions on deposits, which you noted, Sharon. You mentioned it was informed by competitive dynamics. But I wanted to better understand if there's any feedback you or your peers had received from regulators that prompted the decision? Because from our vantage point, the timing of these pricing actions at this stage of the rate cycle is simply difficult to reconcile?\nSharon Yeshaya: I'm sorry, Steve, we don't comment, as you know on regular matters.\nSteven Chubak : Okay, fair enough. [I had to try] (ph) thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning Ted, good morning Sharon.\nTed Pick: Good morning, Gerard. How are you?\nSharon Yeshaya: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Good. Thank you. You gave us good insights into your thinking about what the capital markets could bring, especially Investment Banking. And I think you touched on it in your comments with Ted, or maybe you Sharon, that the transactional numbers could benefit from a stronger ECM business. Can you then take the next second derivative and share with us from your experience of Solium, should we -- that business pick up the workplace channel, if more of these maybe private equity sponsor companies go public. Should the workplace channel see stronger revenues potentially in a stronger Investment Banking market over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nSharon Yeshaya: I think that's a great question. I know, Gerard a few years ago, you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is. I completely agree with you. As you have workplace assets rise, the value of those client assets rise. New corporations issue their employees more stock. They also grow their employee base. It should absolutely add participants. It should add new corporates. It will add new net flows. And now that we have all of that -- when you just have Solium, now you also have E*TRADE and workplace, and the platforms are integrated. So as those flows -- flow into an E*TRADE account, people can transact on that. And then, as Ted said, we can also offer financial wellness. So absolutely, it helps that ecosystem begin to work.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And just as a follow-up, Ted, if I take a step back, obviously you guys have done a very good job in the last 10 years of growing organically, but then complementing that growth with acquisitions. Once we get the Basel III end game final proposal, maybe some G-SIB relief, can you share with us, as you look out over the next two, three years -- is there any parts of the picture today that you'd like to enhance possibly with acquisitions? Or -- are you good where you are today?\nTed Pick: I will take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital, if I could, Gerard, and link that to potential external opportunities. We anticipated or we believe it was possible that we could have a tougher annual CCAR test, and indeed it was. And what we've prioritized in potential uses of capital, above all things has been dividend policy. And as you know, we are increasing the dividend again to [$0.925] (ph), which at spot offers a 3.5% dividend yield. So that is the continued highest priority on use of capital. If you include of course, use of capital to inorganic opportunity. Second our clients. We have continued to lean in for clients, across the business segments as appropriate, and you see the operating leverage across the businesses, particularly across the investment bank. But we've also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital. This past quarter, more than $2 billion between the dividend and the buyback, in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality. As we sit here today, we are 170 basis points above the buffer. And importantly, we continue to be in the 3.0 G-SIB buffer, which in one context would normally get much attention, but does get attention in the context of your question, which is sort of forward-looking strategic opportunity. It is worth noting if we can manage to stay at 3.0, assuming the framework holds through whatever Basel brings, that will be our buffer in 2026. So we are [170 basis points] (ph) over and we accreted $1.5 billion this quarter. External, i.e., inorganic, therefore, is something we can think about. It's just not something we're going to think about in the short term. The reality is we've got our forced hierarchy, the forced hierarchy is dividend first, investing in clients as appropriate, achieving operating returns against that second. And then third, the buyback opportunistically. Down the road, two, three, four years out, if opportunities come across the horizon, importantly after we have some definition around Basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside CCAR formulation, so just general regulatory uncertainty, sure, we might look at stuff. But I would tell you in the short-term, we're very happy with the acquisitions that we've made over the last 10 years, 12 years. And we are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments; Wealth and Investment Management and the Integrated Investment Bank, and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of 70% and the margins and returns that we've talked about.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nTed Pick: Good morning Saul.\nSaul Martinez: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on the outlook for your sales and trading businesses. You've kind of consistently done about into $18 billion to $20 billion of annual revenue in the post-pandemic period, in [fixed and equities] (ph). And right now, we have a backdrop where we're going to see rate cuts, markets are strong, issuance activity may pick up. At the same time, you have perhaps more competition from foreign banks who have lost share. So how do you see -- do you have a view on how you see the wallet evolving for these businesses, your ability to maintain or gain share in this backdrop? And then I guess, ultimately, do you think you can grow revenues here from a base that is materially higher than what it was pre-pandemic?\nTed Pick: I think the answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable. We want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base, whether it be global asset managers, the leading alternative asset managers, private equity and private credit players that have come to the floor, and then our lead corporate and sovereign clients. There are products that can be offered. There are very few firms that can do that globally. We continue to have a world-class market space, for example in Asia, where I believe we have the largest equities business. We've been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent in the UK, where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention. And as you know, we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at MUFG in Tokyo. So if you consider the global footprint of the firm -- in a world that continues to be equities-based. It continues to be an equities world. You see it in the asset price momentum in the US. You see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors. And that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business for example, where we've been very strong traditionally in equities, to do the [cash rise] (ph) and prime brokerage suite that we offer. You could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the US, whether you'll see a steeper yield curve, where you'll see activity on the front and to the belly of the curve. That of course, offers all kinds of opportunities for the rates business. And connected to corporate catalyst activity, where, on an M&A acquisition, the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk, and that's the service that we offer. Again, I like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank. I like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that. But that we are allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a -- once in every few years catalyst event, that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand. So the answer would be to grow and grow responsibly. I'd like to think we can inch up the numerator along with the denominator, and then you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years.\nSaul Martinez: That's helpful. Thank you. Just I guess a quick follow-up, related follow-up. The ROE, 14% in ISG in the first half of the year early on, as you highlighted, in Investment Banking cycle. Do you have a view on where the ISG -- Institutional Securities ROE can get to as the Investment Banking cycle kind of plays out? Is there a view on sort of what a normalized ROE would be here.\nTed Pick: We're still early. We're still early in the cycle. We're watching it of course. To the earlier question on when the green [shoes] (ph) come through on the high-margin M&A product, the reality of seasonality, the uncertainty of rate path, geopolitics, US elections, it's hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties, not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that we are dealing with as we speak, Basel namely. But yes, you're right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the Investment Bank. And over the course of a number of years, as we think about not just the integrated firm, but the returns generated inside of Wealth and Investment Management. And then we look at the returns inside the Investment Bank, we are measuring that. And we are looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable 70% efficiency of the firm.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you and good morning. In the second quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15 billion. Our EPS was $1.82 and our ROTCE was 17.5%. Results highlight the power and scale of our integrated firm. The resilience of the US economy and a more stable near-term outlook on rates supported conviction amongst clients. Institutional securities drove performance, led by strength and equity and a pickup in investment banking. Wealth management also delivered on our established strategy, reporting record durable asset management fees and strong fee-based flows. Together, improved confidence and higher client engagement along with our focus on prioritizing investments, yielded operating leverage, and profitability. The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio was 72% benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base. Year-to-date expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses, the absence of back office integration related costs and severance, as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend. On prioritization, we remain committed to client and asset growth, technology, and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion increased 23% versus last year, capturing the strengths of the integrated investment bank across US, and international markets. Higher activity in Asia contributed to results. Strong performance in institutional equity, as well as debt underwriting, demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise. In our markets business, opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data. Investment banking revenues were $1.6 billion. The 51% increase from the prior year was broad-based. We continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending, broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors, including financials, healthcare, technology, and industrials. These investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up. Advisory revenues were $592 million, reflecting an increase in our completed M&A activity versus the prior year. The pre-announced M&A backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors. Equity underwriting revenues of $352 million improved versus the prior year, driven by increases across most products, but remain below historical averages. From a geographical perspective, we brought a number of transactions to market in Europe and Asia, demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $675 million, well above five-year historical averages. Results reflect a meaningful pickup in non-investment grade loan and bond issuance, as tighter spreads and strong CLO issuance provided opportunities for refinancing. The investment banking backdrop continues to improve, led by the US, the advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors. Inflation data has continued to moderate, which has helped stabilize front-end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor reengagement. As buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap, we expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound. Subject to changes in [rate past] (ph) expectations and geopolitical developments, our integrated investment bank is well-positioned to service our clients. Turning to equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Equity revenues of over $3 billion, up 18% compared to last year, reflect strong results across business and regions. Higher client engagement, dynamic risk management, and strength in Asia all contributed to performance. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year as client balances reached new peaks. Regionally, we witnessed higher client activity in Asia and seasonal patterns in Europe. Cash results increased versus last year, reflecting higher volumes across regions. Derivative results were up versus last year's second quarter as client activity was higher and the business navigated the market environment well. Further, the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances, additional evidence of the integrated firm at work. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion increased year-over-year. Macro performance was up versus the prior year. Despite lower realized volatility, clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter. Micro results improved year-over-year, driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions. Solid results in commodities were in-line with the prior year. Turning to ISG lending and provisions. In the quarter, ISG provisions were $54 million, driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans. Net charge-offs were $48 million, primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions. Turning to Wealth Management. Wealth Management generated strong results generating revenues of $6.8 billion with record asset management fees. Our PBT margin continued to make progress towards our goal, demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle. We are delivering on our differentiated, scaled multichannel asset gathering strategy. Wealth Management client assets reached $5.7 trillion. Moving to our business metrics in the second quarter. Pretax profit was $1.8 billion up year-over-year with a reported margin of 26.8%. DCP negatively impacted our margin by approximately 100 basis points. The margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our asset gathering strategy. We are improving the efficiency with which we run the business. Asset management revenues of $4 billion were up 16%. That is more than $500 million in fees versus the prior year. It's driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive fee-based flows. In the quarter, fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over $20 billion, bringing the year-to-date fee-based flows to $52 billion. We are seeing a steady migration of assets from adviser-led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts, evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying-off. Fee-based assets now stand at $2 trillion. Net new assets were $36 billion reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments. Year-to-date, net new assets are $131 billion representing 5% annualized growth of beginning period assets. Net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and business specific factors. We believe both tax-related outflows and increased spending, particularly among high net worth clients, impacted flows this quarter. Still our first half NNA growth remains solid. Transactional revenues were $782 million. Excluding the impact of DCP revenues were up 5% versus last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher equity-related transactions. Bank lending balances grew by $4 billion to $151 billion evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes, our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs. Total deposits of $343 billion remains stable, with sweep deposits down approximately $10 billion sequentially mostly offset by growth in CDs. Net interest income was down modestly to $1.8 billion reflecting the decline in sweeps, which was largely attributable to the seasonality of tax payments. The Wealth Management business continued to perform well, aggregating assets, generating fees and benefiting from scale and our differentiated offering, consistently earning approximately $100 million a day. In the third quarter, we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates against the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics. The impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio. Therefore third quarter NII will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps, and NII could decline modestly in the third quarter. Importantly inclusive of these pricing changes, the rate path and our expectations around client behavior, we believe that NII should inflect higher as you look out into next year. Our Wealth Management strategy is predicated on gathering assets, meeting our clients' lending needs and offering advice. Asset management fees, the core of our Wealth Management strategy, continues to produce strong results reaching a record this quarter. Taken together, we delivered a strong margin, and we continue to work towards 30% margins over time. This quarter, we reached approximately $19 million in relationships across our three channels, and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement. AI tools are helping advisers grow, and Wealth Management's partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering. These investments have supported flows to our adviser-led channel, where average client duration is nearly 15 years and growing. The steady progress supports our journey towards $10 trillion-plus in total client assets. Turning to Investment Management. Revenues of $1.4 billion increased 8% from the prior second quarter, supported by higher asset management revenue. Asset management and related fees were $1.3 billion up 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher average AUM. Total AUM ended the quarter at $1.5 trillion. Performance-based income and other revenues were $44 million as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure, US private credit and US private equity funds, reflecting our investments in secular growth areas. We recorded long-term net outflows of approximately $1 billion. We continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus, namely Parametric. Consistent with current industry trends, we saw outflows in our active equity strategies. Our business is well-positioned given strength in areas of secular growth, such as customization, direct indexing and private alternatives. Our continued focus on global distribution combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities, should support incremental growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets decreased $16 billion from the prior quarter to $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.2%. Client activity was strong and markets were open. We actively supported clients with a focus on velocity of resources. We also grew our CET1 capital by $1.5 [billion] (ph), reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution. The most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position. For the third year in a row, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.075. Having generated over $3.85 of earnings per share and an 18.6% ROTCE year-to-date, we enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, with a robust capital base to support clients. Investment Banking pipelines are healthy and diverse, dialogues are active and markets are open. In Wealth Management, strong fee-based flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working. As capital markets become more active, we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash and cash equivalent balances into fee-based products. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. Sure. Thanks, Glenn for the question. Actually, the portion that -- of the sweep balances that are impacted are as you mentioned, the sweep on the adviser-led channel, which is actually a small portion of the overall BDP that we disclose. So it's a small portion of that overall stack. And the increase in pricing is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio, right? So as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices, it's that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead. Certainly. Yes, what I would note there is that what we think about -- when we think about sweeps, broadly is mainly in transactional accounts. And in those transactional accounts, we have a wide range of choices and products for our clients. And so therefore, they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage. Yes. So why don't I take that, and then you can ask your second question. So you are pointing at a great point Ebrahim, as we look ahead through time, which was the second point of my guidance, is that when we look over the next year, we're seeing and we expect that we should see an inflection in NII. And that is predicated on the points that you mentioned, which is that as you see rate cuts, we would expect those balances to stabilize. Remember, outside of the tax quarter this particular quarter, we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits. So it's important to recognize that, that has been happening, reaching that frictional level of transactional cash. So that would likely continue. And then over time, you would also begin to see a benefit as rates to be cut, that BDP could actually see inflows, which you've seen from a historical perspective. But in addition to that, you have two other factors. One is the repricing of the portfolio, which I've also already mentioned. And the second piece has to do with lending. We look to continue to support our clients with lending products, and you are beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection. This is the first quarter that we've seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began. We've seen now use of SBL products rather than just it being offset by paydowns. So those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for NII. Sure. I'll take that. It's -- we continue to see broad-based sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from. In this particular quarter, as I mentioned the biggest offset and drag though, is really from taxes. So it's -- you still have a workplace accounts. You still have the advice-based account directly. You still have self-directed. All those places remain contributors. What continues in my mind to be most interesting though, isn't just the contribution that you are getting from the three various channels, but the fact that you have in the advice-based channel, it's not just coming from existing clients, but it's split with existing and net new clients. And some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace. So I would not just directly focus on what channel is it coming from, but how are you seeing those channel in that interplay work, because that's actually the power of the differentiated platform. Once you have somebody who wants more differentiated advice for self-directed speaks to an advisor, that advisor sees net new clients, bring in assets, and then that's new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee-based. So it's really the whole ecosystem that I would call your attention to, rather than just one isolated leg. So thanks, Brennan, I'll take that question. No, all the changes that we'll make will happen, are expected to happen in the third quarter. And so those different changes will be made, and they'll be based on various competitive dynamics. That's exactly as I stated it, and it will just be limited as you said, to the sweeps that are dealt within the advisor-led channel. Yes. I think that's a really interesting question. I did call it out. We've seen increased spending by higher net worth, and so higher income bands are certainly spending. We see that in the data alongside actual spending. We see that in purchases of homes. We see that in various tailored investments. So they are -- that cohort, so to speak, is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways. So I do think that -- that's an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well. It's only something we are seeing in our data. So when you look at it, I would really focus Steve, on the efficiency ratio targets that we put for the whole firm, right? We think that the firm can run at or below the 70% over time through a durable cycle. The issue with your specific question, as you yourself highlighted is, it depends on where those different revenues are coming from. So there might be periods of time where it's higher BC&E related, there might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it. But broadly speaking, the enterprise we've given 30% margins as it relates to Wealth and the sort of Wealth and Investment Management space, and then you have the ISG space. So by definition, if you're running at 70% efficiency ratio more broadly, you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a 30% margin. I'm sorry, Steve, we don't comment, as you know on regular matters. Good morning. I think that's a great question. I know, Gerard a few years ago, you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is. I completely agree with you. As you have workplace assets rise, the value of those client assets rise. New corporations issue their employees more stock. They also grow their employee base. It should absolutely add participants. It should add new corporates. It will add new net flows. And now that we have all of that -- when you just have Solium, now you also have E*TRADE and workplace, and the platforms are integrated. So as those flows -- flow into an E*TRADE account, people can transact on that. And then, as Ted said, we can also offer financial wellness. So absolutely, it helps that ecosystem begin to work."

            "name": "Ted Pick",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. The firm generated $15 billion in revenue, $1.82 in EPS, and a 17.5% return on tangible in the second quarter. [Solid earnings] (ph) and demonstration of operating leverage completes a strong first half of 2024. $30 billion in revenue, $6 billion in earnings, and an 18.6% return on capital. In institutional securities, we're beginning to see the benefits from our continued focus on our world-class investment banking franchise, with revenues up 50% year-over-year, including a 70% increase year-over-year in fixed income underwriting. In institutional equities, we are back with a $3 billion quarter. In wealth, we posted margins of 27%, and across wealth and investment management, we've now grown total client assets to $7.2 trillion on our road to $10 trillion plus. Together, we delivered strong operating leverage. Further, on the back of the annual stress test results, we announced that we will increase the dividend by $0.075 for the third year in a row to [$0.925] (ph), reflecting the growth of our durable earnings over time. During the quarter, we built $1.5 billion of capital, and at quarter end, our CET1 ratio is 15.2%, 170 basis points above the forward requirement. Our capital position provides us the flexibility to continue to support dividend growth, support our clients, and buy the stock back opportunistically. The quarter also showed continued balance in both top-line and profitability across the major segments. Wealth and institutional securities produced $6.8 billion and $7 billion in revenue respectively, with earnings also roughly split between our institutional businesses and wealth and investment management. Our businesses are working closely together to maximize adjacent opportunities across the integrated firm. Across the investment bank, navigating changes in the cycle means being deliberate around risk management and, given geopolitical uncertainty, where we spend our time to deliver clients, solutions, and to capture share. In wealth management, we continue to focus on aggregating assets and delivering strong advice. In investment management, we are investing in secular growth areas, including customization and real assets. Year-to-date, annualized growth in net new assets and wealth management is over 5%, with another strong quarter of over $25 billion in fee-based flows. Strong fee-based flows support daily revenue, which on average continues to be about $100 million each day this year throughout and show the stability and continued growth of the wealth franchise. We are well navigating the continued uncertainty around forward rate path, geopolitics, and now the US Political cycle and expect those to be the themes for the balance of the year. We remain focused on our best-in-class talent and building out best-in-class infrastructure to support ongoing growth across wealth and investment management and institutional securities. I wanted to reiterate our strategy, which is clear to advise individuals and institutions around the world in raising, managing, and allocating capital. World-class execution demands that we deliver strong earnings and returns through the cycle, that we do so while maintaining robust capital levels, and that we deliver on a durable growth narrative across the segments. And then Morgan Stanley executes on this strategy in a first-class way [Blue] (ph). That's it in a nutshell. And finally, in reflecting on this weekend's assassination attempt, we share in the hope that in the months to come, we will as Americans, find ways to unify and preserve our better selves. With that, Sharon will now take us through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you. Good morning, Glenn. Good morning Ebrahim. Thanks, Ebrahim. Confidence level, high. If you take a step back, there are three pieces to the Wealth Management line; asset management, transactional, net interest income, as you know. In the asset management context, those are fees that are going to fee-based accounts, advisory-led. Those figures are up 4% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. That is fee-paying advice. Last quarter, the net new assets into that category was $26 billion. So fee-based flows -- that continues to be a growth piece of the Wealth Management store. The second cylinder is transactional. Transactional has been relatively weak, which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity. And as you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank, that will bleed through over time to the transactional line. And then third, the net interest income line. And as Sharon said, that will inflect and should inflect over the next year. You put those together, the scale of the business, the funnel, and the processing of $100 million of revenues a day that continue to grow, we are going to continue to achieve operating leverage. It's that simple. We're investing in E*TRADE. We're investing in the traditional advisor, and we're spending a lot of time top of house focused on workplace, which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base. In January, I had said 30% was the goal. We were in the mid-20s. We just printed 27% GAAP, 28% [Ex-CPE] (ph). It's a core stated objective. It will take some quarters to get there, but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business. Good morning Mike. It's an excellent question because you're exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this and it has been sort of a delayed shoots if you will. But I think now we are seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates. We are also beginning along with that to see the market broaden-out. You of course have seen that over the last number of weeks. And I think, we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken, whether that is across the corporate community or sponsors or other institutions. And the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product. Global convertibles activity is up significantly. And as you know, on the margin ladder, it typically goes converts, IPO, and then M&A. In the context of bake-offs and the like, in some spaces we are seeing bake-offs running at triple plus the year-over-year rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups. We've been seeing now the launch of traditional IPOs and we are seeing M&A pipeline kicking in. So corporate community, sponsor community, cross-border community, I think we are in the early stages of a multi-year investment banking-led cycle. If you believe the economy is going to hold up led by the US, you should expect then to see that if there is some regulatory normalization too across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active. So we are quite convicted on this call. I mean it's a fair question. You've written about this in the context of what was the normal before financial repression, right? And I would take the view that in the context of the last 15 years, even some normalization, because I don't know that we are going to go into a full-blown rate cycle to your point, some normalizations of rates will still have you at 3% or 4% on the front-end and even some steepening potentially. So now we are just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of mid-90s in most normal economic periods. And the game will have to go on because there is just been some activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure percentage of asset stock percentage of market cap. And the stickiness that we are seeing in the sponsor community, too needs to unglue. There is an enormous, as you know multitrillion-dollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder that's been raised. That will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another. So in short, unless you were to tell me we are going to go into a full-blown recession, which none of us can call, and that even if we saw rates normalize to something that is along the lines of the historic 4% on the front end, I think you will see over the next number of quarters and really over the next number of years, a resumption of more normalized M&A activity, with the key difference being that the financial sponsor community is now institutionally come of age. They have global reach. They can work the entire capital structure. They will work in concert with corporate partners, as you know. They don't actually have to act as a lone wolves, and they can work with us to finance the package. So it is not just the straight M&A advise or the straight IPO, it would also be bespoke offerings in the private public space, interest rate and foreign exchange hedging and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring. And this is really why, over the last couple of years, the extent we've done a so-called front-office hiring, it really has been to target several very high-quality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the Morgan Stanley platform. And we are seeing the fruits of that across industries. So I am quite bullish on it. Certainly take your point that has been a number of quarters on sort of on the promise. But I think as we get into 2025 and the election coming and then the election behind us, we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace. Good morning Dan. Which is part of the reason that workplace is so important, because at workplace, I can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth, and then potentially other products around it. So it can be an indirect sale where you aren't necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the FA, but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace where we do a great job educating on wellness -- financial wellness and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the Morgan Stanley Solium product and having succeeded on an MS at work mandate, which, as you know is a durable, sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base, you can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that front. Good morning Brennan. Good morning Devin. Well, I know that competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset. Here, we have -- we believe, something really special inside of our Institutional Securities business, our so-called integrated investment bank, which has been ongoing for -- now we are getting on seven or eight years. Now under Dan Simkowitz's direction. And this is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income, equities and banking through our capital markets new issue business. You have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another. So there is real familiarity now with the work product. A lot of the work product, as you know, is not traditional vanilla IPOs. Yes. There are some on the horizon that are quite substantial, and we'd expect that to be an important part of the calendar. But there is also a more bespoke product, whether it be convertibles or products in the private area or products that effectively necessitate high-quality structuring and advice, and that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have world-class investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues, not just in the new issue business but as appropriate, in institutional equities and in fixed income. And if you look at our fixed income business, for example and fixed income underwriting, you'll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary. And that the year-over-year revenue number, I believe is up 71%. That speaks to the fine work that's been done by folks, not just in the debt capital markets business which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking, but also working closely with fixed income professionals, whether they are in the securitized products group and our commodities area broader credit or in our macro space, i.e., interest rate and foreign exchange. So when you get into the knitting of ISG, our Integrated Investment Bank, you see that part of the reason that we are bullish, not just to Mike's earlier question on the denominator, but also on our ability to increase the numerator, is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital. We will do so as appropriate when the markets demand it. But that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that comes from the familiarity of our people, the quality of the advice that is differentiated and importantly, that it's global, so that we can bring it to the client base. So that is part of, I think, the secret sauce that we've been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns, inside the investment bank on a stand-alone basis. And that obviously doesn't include even the synergies that we'd see across the Firm into Wealth and Investment Management. But your question is on the investment bank specifically. And I feel really good about the way it's structured, the leadership that we have within it, the experience set, and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle which will be different than the last one. Rates will be well higher than that of financial repression. We'll be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession. We'll be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle, US election cycle, but the world around us. But also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community, where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the Investment Bank, Wealth and Investment Management. Good morning Steve. Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is, of course as you know, there is real seasonality in the business. Fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter, street-wide in the first quarter, Investment Banking typically in the fourth quarter. That's not every year, but that's typically out shakes out. Third quarter tends to be weaker in the summer months, and then it's sort of all about September. And obviously, this September will be one that will be driven in part by sentiment around the upcoming elections. So that's kind of the seasonality piece. The other is just the scale within the businesses, I'd be remiss again, not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached $3 billion in the equities business. This has been a leading business where we have been Number 1 and Number 2 for the last dozen years. And we see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash, derivatives and prime brokerage. And then connecting to Investment Banking, I think that business has too hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute high-margin business through the cycle. All of this, of course is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels. But given where we are right now, we are feeling good about that, too. Good morning, Gerard. How are you? I will take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital, if I could, Gerard, and link that to potential external opportunities. We anticipated or we believe it was possible that we could have a tougher annual CCAR test, and indeed it was. And what we've prioritized in potential uses of capital, above all things has been dividend policy. And as you know, we are increasing the dividend again to [$0.925] (ph), which at spot offers a 3.5% dividend yield. So that is the continued highest priority on use of capital. If you include of course, use of capital to inorganic opportunity. Second our clients. We have continued to lean in for clients, across the business segments as appropriate, and you see the operating leverage across the businesses, particularly across the investment bank. But we've also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital. This past quarter, more than $2 billion between the dividend and the buyback, in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality. As we sit here today, we are 170 basis points above the buffer. And importantly, we continue to be in the 3.0 G-SIB buffer, which in one context would normally get much attention, but does get attention in the context of your question, which is sort of forward-looking strategic opportunity. It is worth noting if we can manage to stay at 3.0, assuming the framework holds through whatever Basel brings, that will be our buffer in 2026. So we are [170 basis points] (ph) over and we accreted $1.5 billion this quarter. External, i.e., inorganic, therefore, is something we can think about. It's just not something we're going to think about in the short term. The reality is we've got our forced hierarchy, the forced hierarchy is dividend first, investing in clients as appropriate, achieving operating returns against that second. And then third, the buyback opportunistically. Down the road, two, three, four years out, if opportunities come across the horizon, importantly after we have some definition around Basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside CCAR formulation, so just general regulatory uncertainty, sure, we might look at stuff. But I would tell you in the short-term, we're very happy with the acquisitions that we've made over the last 10 years, 12 years. And we are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments; Wealth and Investment Management and the Integrated Investment Bank, and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of 70% and the margins and returns that we've talked about. Good morning Saul. I think the answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable. We want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base, whether it be global asset managers, the leading alternative asset managers, private equity and private credit players that have come to the floor, and then our lead corporate and sovereign clients. There are products that can be offered. There are very few firms that can do that globally. We continue to have a world-class market space, for example in Asia, where I believe we have the largest equities business. We've been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent in the UK, where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention. And as you know, we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at MUFG in Tokyo. So if you consider the global footprint of the firm -- in a world that continues to be equities-based. It continues to be an equities world. You see it in the asset price momentum in the US. You see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors. And that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business for example, where we've been very strong traditionally in equities, to do the [cash rise] (ph) and prime brokerage suite that we offer. You could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the US, whether you'll see a steeper yield curve, where you'll see activity on the front and to the belly of the curve. That of course, offers all kinds of opportunities for the rates business. And connected to corporate catalyst activity, where, on an M&A acquisition, the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk, and that's the service that we offer. Again, I like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank. I like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that. But that we are allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a -- once in every few years catalyst event, that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand. So the answer would be to grow and grow responsibly. I'd like to think we can inch up the numerator along with the denominator, and then you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years. We're still early. We're still early in the cycle. We're watching it of course. To the earlier question on when the green [shoes] (ph) come through on the high-margin M&A product, the reality of seasonality, the uncertainty of rate path, geopolitics, US elections, it's hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties, not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that we are dealing with as we speak, Basel namely. But yes, you're right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the Investment Bank. And over the course of a number of years, as we think about not just the integrated firm, but the returns generated inside of Wealth and Investment Management. And then we look at the returns inside the Investment Bank, we are measuring that. And we are looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable 70% efficiency of the firm."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\nTed Pick: Good morning, and happy spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We entered 2024 with optimism, encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our institutional and wealth management clients, the quarter was strong. We generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2.02 in earnings per share and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisor to our clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base. We saw greater activity both in the advisor based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net new assets grew by $95 billion. Investment Management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter. Across both wealth and investment management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion advancing toward our $10 trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us regain our leadership position in equity capital markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in investment banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients. [Audio Gap] both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities. As ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement and being judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients, invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate Basel III endgame. Additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I wanted to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with 3 short observations. First, this quarter's wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including strong margins and very strong net new assets. We are really pleased with this terrific performance and we are going to keep ongoing. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world class in every aspect of this growing business. And third, to be clear, this is about processes. We have been spending time, effort and money for multiple years, and it is ongoing. We've been on it. And the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter of 2024 aligns with the goals outlined in the January strategy deck: $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, $7 trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible. We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis. I'm very optimistic what lies ahead for Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of our 2,300 Managing Directors and 80,000 employees, say to those listening to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and in its intensity. Now, I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya to discuss the quarter in more detail.\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion. Our EPS was $2.02 and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business, stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full income statement, all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integration. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend, lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross divisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions. Investment banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading indicators continued to progress positively, including the preliminary reemergence of sponsor activity. Advisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the quarter alongside conducive markets for follow-ons. Our global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border transactions, and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting lead tables as global market volumes picked up. Fixed income underwriting increased year over year to $556 million, results were driven by strength in investment grade and noninvestment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads. Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines. While the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of pipeline to realized, conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity. Turning to Equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Revenues were strong increasing 4% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash, and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting broad based strength in equity markets across the region. Performance in Japan was particularly strong supported by higher volumes. Our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with MUFG should be supportive over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client activity was strong. Prime Brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year. Recall, last year's result benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events, including those related to the U.S. regional banks. Client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset, reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise. Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the North America Power and Gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. The business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to $6.9 billion driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors. Importantly, net interest income remained in line sequentially. Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion with contributions from multiple channels including our family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture. Fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the advisor led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. This demonstrates that over time, assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue generating accounts. Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset Management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional revenues were $1 billion and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products. Investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand. Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages. Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering. While sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest income was $1.9 billion flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in average deposit cost was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates. Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels. Total AUM increased to $1.5 trillion, long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion inflows were driven by strengths in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives and solutions, demand for parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own wealth management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity based products, underscoring the value of the integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity and overlay services had out close of $12.9 billion. Performance based income and other revenues were $31 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and private credit offset lowered accrued carried interest in Asia private equity and real estate demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform. We are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private credit and our global distribution. Parametric, in particular, has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm, evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter. The vast majority of share based award conversion takes place in the first quarter resulting in a lower tax rate. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time. With that, we will now open the line up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate you not running away from a sensitive subject. I'm going to push the envelope and just ask one follow-up if possible on the wealth matter. I wonder if you could size the non-U. S. wealth piece whether it be in client assets or revenue for us. And correct me if I'm wrong, if that's the focus? And then more importantly, do you think obviously, you had a pretty darn good quarter. So, do you think this impacts any day-to-day or your ability to grow and onboard clients in the future? That's my real main question.\nSharon Yeshaya: I think it's a great question, Glenn. Happy to take that and just follow-up on exactly what Ted said, which is as you said, the results really speak for themselves. This is a phenomenal business. We had record revenues and we're in a great position. We have strong margins, strong net new assets, and no, there are no strategic changes to our business. There is no changes in our ability to do business, and we're extremely confident in our ability to grow and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients. Specific to your question on the international business, it is small.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Maybe Ted for you, as we think about, so it was a strong quarter for Investment Banking Underwriting. There seems to be a fragility to the macro outlook based on what how rates have behaved on the back of inflation, geopolitics? Just give us a sentiment check of when you're talking to your corporate clients, like how resilient do you see the investment banking sort of trends and the sort of desire and appetite for corporates to engage in either DCM, ECM or M&A, large M&A activity as we look into sort of later in the year into the U.S. Elections?\nTed Pick: The pipeline is clearly growing. It's growing across sectors. It's growing on a cross border basis. There are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle. And there is activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community will effectively be bidding with and against each other for assets. This is a moment when most want to purify their business model or grow. And that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of COVID and supply chain are in front of us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds, it is not surprising that the C suite wants to act. So I think we are in the early innings of a multiyear M&A cycle. On the back of that, we should continue to see all kinds of underwriting. What was interesting about this ECM quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of IPOs from the Valley, capital raises from industrial companies, regional trades, cross border unlocks. It was the whole potpourri of offerings and we've also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the high yield and leverage loan market. So I'm feeling good about this being early to mid-cycle for the classic investment banking capital markets business around the world. And as you know, we are very active in Japan where we think activity will be heightened for years to come.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just one quick follow-up Sharon, on the wealth management NII and sweep deposits. I think the sense is that we're getting to a bit of a bottom on NII. Is that an accurate characterization? And should we stop worrying about a big cliff event where NII declines meaningfully from where we trended?\nSharon Yeshaya: I welcome the day where I stopped getting questions on NII. I would characterize this, it's now the third quarter in a row that I've said that our suite models and the client behavior is following client expectations. It does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash. Of course we'll have to wait and see how things play out, but broadly speaking it feels as though like I said we are at a place where you have what we would say is inter quarter volatility associated with things that might be T-bills maturing, people putting things in markets. But that again is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or movements in real client behavior, which is what you saw 2 years ago in the summer when we saw the large move in rates, which was a one off event, and then you had again a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year. So those are very specific events that we can look at and since then, like I said, we have been working with our modeled expectations.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So maybe just starting off on the expense outlook. We saw some good progress on the expense front and the KPIs are encouraging. Headcount was down year-on-year. Comp and non-comp surprised positively in ISG and Wealth. And I was hoping you could just speak to your efforts to rationalize or optimize the expense base. And with IB and Wealth fees expected to ramp consistent with the M&A commentary, Ted, that you cited, how should we be thinking about incremental margins as these businesses and particularly fees start to grow?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly, let's take just the expense big picture and we obviously disclosed the SEC drivers of expenses, I called them out. We've had multiple years now where we've been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions, and as we've come out of that we've been able to reevaluate our expense base. And I've talked about it in different pieces of our earnings call, many times I've mentioned space. You can see even in the lines around occupancy in the actual disclosures, you can see bump ups in spaces where you're taking write offs down in space and then it begins to trend down again. So we're making big picture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest those growth drivers as we move forward. So consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars, consolidating professional services, how do we actually want to deploy full time hires in those growth objectives. So in my prepared remarks, we talked about 2 things. We talked about taking expenses down in certain line items, but we also discussed investments, right. I talked about the fact that we're looking at opportunistic hires in M&A. We've discussed a lot about investing in parametric and technology. We've been giving technological tools to our advisors and investing in the business. So it's a push pull and it's making sure as Ted said that we're sweating the income statement and we're thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move forward through the cycle.\nTed Pick: What I'd add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings, our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group, the management committee of about 3 dozen and then their leadership teams. I think it's fair to say Steve over the last 5 years, a large chunk of time was spent talking about capital efficiency, how we can optimize those toggles and of course with Basel III endgame pending and the annual CCAR process ongoing. We, of course, continue dedicate time to that. But the C change over the last number of quarters and it is accelerated now into 2024 is we're actively talking about the income statement, about delivering earnings growth, earnings momentum that obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter. But we're looking to make investments, strategic investments in top human capital now and then when it comes about, but we're being pretty judicious about that. This is a great platform and we have a great team, but we need to be running this thing super efficiently. And that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of 70% in January was so important and that we put up 71% this quarter where it was a generally constructive environment. I think I called it a relatively constructive environment, but there's clearly more operating leverage to be had when you get to the higher brackets of ISG and then as you move to the funnel of wealth. So the focus on generating that operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership team.\nSteven Chubak : That's great color. And just for my follow-up, relating to the wealth management margins, unpacking some of the different component pieces, given continued strong fee momentum, nice to see the inflection in NNA too. It sounds like NII is close to stabilizing just given some of the key drivers and inputs. And the focus on efficiency just throwing all of that in the blender does suggest that this 26% is probably a reasonable jumping off point and you can build off that base, but I was hoping you could maybe provide some context around that?\nSharon Yeshaya: Well, what I would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck and we're obviously making progress towards those goals. When you think about what gets you to 30%, the framework that we've offered the investment community is that there is sort of 3 parts to it. The first is migration to advice, the second and really the monetization of the funnel will go through this. The second when you think about it is solutions and products that we're offering, and then the third is the benefits of scale. And what was encouraging about this quarter is that all three of those things happened. The first being the fee based flows that we saw at $26 billion came from brokerage accounts. They came from people taking money that was already in the channel that we said will eventually be deployed, and it is being deployed and that's what you're seeing here. If you look back, it's a, that particular transition, that conversion is at a 2-year peak. Again, encouraging color, Steve. The second piece, solutions, products, differentiated offering. I called out structured products. People have interest in products, as Ted said, as markets begin to improve, those could be new issuance, that can be derivatives, that can be solutions through structured notes. That's what we're seeing beginning to happen here. So yes, again, an encouraging sign. And the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating leverage. So all three things are working, of course there is room to run, but what we're trying to do is make sure that we also have the right tradeoffs between investing in the business, giving ourselves room for technology, and being able to build a 30% margin for sustainable business and durable revenues over time.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I'd love to start with a question on NII. I know I've asked this in the past, but we saw stability in the Wealth Management NII, which Sharon you've spoken at linked about both from this and in fact, but we did see the firm wide NII dip again and it was the fourth quarter where the firm wide NII declined. So could you explain how those diverged and maybe what caused some of that divergence?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I think we've talked about it before, Brennan. But I'm happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason that we point you to the wealth management NII is it's a business driven NII. When we look at the trading NII and we look at firm NII, it really depends on the products that you have, where you're booking them, what you're using as your funding sources. That falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue. So we call, we focus you in from our disclosures really on the wealth management NII when that NII is being driven by a business concept rather than just where you might be booking certain trading trades.\nBrennan Hawken: Is there something going on in the institutional NII that would cause sort of steady declines, and with those specific products that maybe might be a trend that we could explore a little bit?\nSharon Yeshaya: No, I would really step you back and tell you that that's not how we manage the business and the trading revenue is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in that quarter. And the wealth management revenue, I've given you the drivers with the deposits, with interest rates, with spreads and with reinvestment and really two separate things that you should looking at.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: You had big year-over-year growth in Wealth Management client assets up by about 20%, but the Wealth Management revenues increased by 5%, still decent growth, but it seems like a little disconnect there. So I'm wondering what kind of wealth management client assets you're growing?\nSharon Yeshaya: Certainly. So when you're growing the wealth management client assets, it's going to be all sorts of places. Like I said, we begin to see assets, they can come in actually in the brokerage side. And over time they will migrate or can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side. Those different assets are going to have different fees associated with them. For us it's about growing the funnel, Mike, and then beginning to see this movement towards advice. Now I'd also point out that once you're in the advice led channel, even if you're in the fee-based channel, you might not directly be in the S&P. There is a composite, there might be preferences to be in fixed income products, there might be preferences to be in equity products. But for us it's about building sustainable durable revenue over time. First, you bring in the clients and the participants, we've seen the participants grow. Then you bring in the assets. We've seen the assets grow. That then comes into the brokerage accounts, which eventually moves into the advice-based accounts, and we continue to see great trends in the advice driven model, in fee-based assets and the advice the asset management revenues. The asset management revenues, Mike at a record high, so I would just highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working.\nMike Mayo: And then just one follow-up for Ted. Ted, I think your outlook for the industry capital markets was about as bullish as we've heard yet. I think you used the word potpourri. IPOs in the valley, cross border by sector, financial sponsor, Japan, highest in years, event financing, specifically, what are your backlogs? How do they compare with last quarter? And just one more time, the level of your conviction that this time is for real, because there's been a lot of false starts the last 2 years?\nTed Pick: Yes, I think it's a reasonable question. The backlogs are all up. I think it will be a slow march back. People are not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the SPAC period clearly. But the receptivity to recent IPOs that were high quality was quite impressive, quite broad interest among investors. The need to execute on cross-border M&A is here. It's for many companies an existential reality. Their supply chains have been disrupted by 2 major global conflicts and they need to near shore and make the trade off, which means they need to potentially bolt on piece of supply chain that's in front of them. They may need to take regulatory risk. There may need to be structuring and financing advice around that so called solutions where we think we're strong. The other motivating piece, Mike, is and I do think there's going to be growing consensus on this. The financial sponsor community is sitting on product that has a 3, 4, 5-year life as a private company ready to come out one way or the other, either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets. That is the best way for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their LPs and keep the thing going with raising ever big funds. So there will be a competitive dynamic I believe between the financial sponsor and corporate community with respect to assets that are available, whether they are public or private in order to continue to create value for their LPs or shareholders. The fact that the U.S. Economy continues to grow, that China is weaker, that parts of Europe are weaker, highlights the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the U.S. With respect to Japan, what's interesting there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets, which is to say they're sitting on enormous yen denominated deposits, but they wish to grow the economy. So that is a market obviously where we're active in the financial sponsor and corporate communities both in and out will continue to be. So, I am quite bullish about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach. It could take several years and have some lumpiness along the way. But I think the next 3, 4, 5 years will be quite active.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: I'm hoping you could provide an update on overall client cash levels within wealth and how you think about the revenue opportunity as that cash is eventually redeployed?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. So we did see the percentage of client cash. So we've given you I think 22% in the advisory channel is now down to, say, 21%, 20% levels depending on what channels that you're looking at. But that, I would say, is not a function of the actual cash levels coming down, but rather that the equity markets have risen, so just to be clear in terms of the actual mix. The reason I bring up those percentages is they are still high relative to the pre-COVID historical levels of, say, 17%, 18% that we've given on previous calls. So there is still room to see the deployment of cash over time into the markets.\nDan Fannon: Understood. And as a follow-up, in the release you mentioned about half of the flows came from your family office offering. Not sure we've heard that stat before or so I was hoping you could bring in, some provide some context in terms of the size of that business for you? And then also just the mix of flows more broadly in terms of the channels, if you could provide a few more specifics in terms of the percentage breakdown?\nSharon Yeshaya: Absolutely. I'm so glad you asked, as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it for some time. We launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in 2021. We discussed it on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm, and by that I mean a way to offer our wealth management clients different solutions from institutional securities. So our fund management products, where you're actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way that you would as an institutional client. As we begin to offer new solutions to our clients, these are more ways to get touch points with different and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board. So this is an example of that. The reason we pointed out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels. And so when we say these flows can be lumpy, there are different sales channels across the offering and those different channels have different sales cycles and so therefore you will see ins and outs of various pieces of NNA over time, but in this particular quarter and over the long-term history we have seen a very diversified set of channels. We have the workplace, we obviously have the advice-based relationship, different pieces of stock plan, et cetera that come in through the channel and there is diversification there.\nTed Pick: Yes. What I'd add to that is, to Sharon's point on integrated firm, we have this Sharon made reference to this gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called Fund Services, which caters to alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their LPs. The question that has been asked over the last number of years is, when some of these folks go on to open their family office and manage their own wealth? What about having a product that has the feel of an institutional product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for related business. So the folks in Fund Services got together with the folks in wealth management who run our outsourced CIO product and they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very much in the ultra-high net worth category. And this helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that we've all been focused on over the last number of years, which is the very high net worth space, which is very competitive. But in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and have them work together with the founder in her next life managing a family office. It's actually a nice seamless way to keep the funds in house and to deliver institutional style capability to clients. So this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division and the wealth management folks are working hand in glove to deliver something for clients.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: A question just on trading. Obviously, results have just been incredibly resilient at a high level. And I know you all have spoken about both market share opportunities for Morgan Stanley, but then there's still this kind of expansion of the overall industry wallet. So love to maybe just hit on that second point. And when you think about that wallet opportunity, the expansion of the wallet, what are some of the biggest opportunities in kind of the growth out rooms? I think a lot of us are sitting here saying results have been phenomenal. How can they continue to improve from here?\nSharon Yeshaya: Sure. I'll take that. When you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and where we are now, as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more integrated, there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer, be that from a global perspective, if you think about where rates are as just a tangible example, interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations as they think about transactions. There are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think about when you're looking at M&A or you're looking at other corporate deals that you have to do in house for a global franchise. So there are corporate solutions that you see, we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective, and there's also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing, private credit being an example. We're financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly.\nTed Pick: And what I would add to that is, we're in the middle of the PE ecosystem. With respect to M&A financing risk, if you ask a number of the asset managers, both real money and alternative asset managers, they would say we are a partner of choice. So opportunity exists within credit, where there's a big focus on the financing side. It's obviously stable revenue and we're getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and inside of our new issue business to originate structure, finance credit, of course, a focus on private credit and then in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives. So this ecosystem around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability, this is a space and a client base that we are focused on along with, of course, our leading strategic clients on the corporate side.\nDevin Ryan: And then a follow-up just on the debt capital markets outlook, obviously very strong quarter. We have heard a little bit about maybe some pull forward, just on the year in terms of people front loading. And so, just want to get a sense of whether you feel like that may play down as well for Morgan Stanley. And then when you think about the pipeline for debt underwriting, I appreciate that deals come together quickly, so there's maybe not as much of a formal pipeline. But is the tone there similarly strong is what you're seeing for M&A and equity underwriting? And also appreciate there's probably some interconnectivity there as well.\nSharon Yeshaya: Yes. I would point you to as you said there is interconnectivity. Remember that I think many of the peers have also mentioned there could have been some pull forward that you saw. It's also been a market that's been open over the course of the last 2 years. So I wouldn't draw these same parallel that you might have seen in M&A or in equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last 2 years, but rather that market especially in IG has been relatively open. When you think about high yield and other non-IG kinds of concepts and of course there is the event related transactions, but from an IG market, that market has been well open over the last 2 years.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Ted, you had some very encouraging comments on the outlook for the capital markets, which is great. Question for you, you mentioned about the high yield and leveraged loan market. You're starting to see event financing, which is good. How is the competition from the private credit side because they have made inroads obviously in the last couple of years? Are you guys seeing that the traditional investment banks are gaining some of that market share back?\nTed Pick: The competition is real. And we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem. I think there's going to be room for folks in the private space to participate in deals. But I certainly do not believe as some seem to suggest that the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things don't go well. So I think we're in a world where the ecosystem will at times have many of the players acting as partners. Sometimes we'll act as counterparties and at times even competitors. But I think the ecosystem has more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space, but also the incumbents to continue to be able to do their thing.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And just as a quick follow-up to that, once again your outlook is very encouraging. 10 years up again today, there's talk of it moving even higher. You know, the front end of the curve is talking about higher for longer. If we get into a really higher for longer rate environment, does that kind of weigh on some of the optimism of the outlook that you presented today or no, it doesn't really have a material impact on it?\nTed Pick: Well, it's a great question. It depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth in the U.S. or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing, in which case we're in recession and clearly then things will slow down. I think our view is that the U.S. economy continues to progress quite nicely, that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong, both on the institutional side and on the wealth side, and that there is plenty to do and that the higher rates that we see are in part, if not more than in part dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world. But that again speaks to U.S. strength and as you know, first and foremost, we have our activity based in the U.S. But over time, there will be strength in places again like Japan and Europe, and then eventually in the China complex where we will be busy too. So my bullishness is not a mark-to-market on any given week or month. It's a view that corporate boardrooms have been quiet for 3, 4 years and that is not sustainable. They need to move. They're ready to move before the pandemic, then the pandemic came and then there were higher rates. Those higher rates seem to be well absorbed. Yes, now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital, as we saw in prior regimes where cost of capital matter. And now we're in a period that comes after financial repression, where we'll have some inflation and some real rates and companies and financial sponsors will adapt and the strong companies will prosper. So we are setting up for that and we believe will be a multiyear cycle. And I would say finally that what we're most excited about of course is the model that we are working with both the institutional community, but also our wealth management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sharon Yeshaya",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion. Our EPS was $2.02 and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business, stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full income statement, all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integration. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend, lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross divisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions. Investment banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading indicators continued to progress positively, including the preliminary reemergence of sponsor activity. Advisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the quarter alongside conducive markets for follow-ons. Our global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border transactions, and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting lead tables as global market volumes picked up. Fixed income underwriting increased year over year to $556 million, results were driven by strength in investment grade and noninvestment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads. Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines. While the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of pipeline to realized, conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity. Turning to Equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Revenues were strong increasing 4% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash, and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting broad based strength in equity markets across the region. Performance in Japan was particularly strong supported by higher volumes. Our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with MUFG should be supportive over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client activity was strong. Prime Brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year. Recall, last year's result benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events, including those related to the U.S. regional banks. Client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset, reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise. Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the North America Power and Gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. The business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to $6.9 billion driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs. Transactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors. Importantly, net interest income remained in line sequentially. Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion with contributions from multiple channels including our family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture. Fee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the advisor led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. This demonstrates that over time, assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue generating accounts. Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset Management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional revenues were $1 billion and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products. Investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand. Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages. Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering. While sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest income was $1.9 billion flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in average deposit cost was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates. Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels. Total AUM increased to $1.5 trillion, long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion inflows were driven by strengths in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives and solutions, demand for parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own wealth management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity based products, underscoring the value of the integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity and overlay services had out close of $12.9 billion. Performance based income and other revenues were $31 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and private credit offset lowered accrued carried interest in Asia private equity and real estate demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform. We are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private credit and our global distribution. Parametric, in particular, has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm, evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter. The vast majority of share based award conversion takes place in the first quarter resulting in a lower tax rate. We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time. With that, we will now open the line up to questions. I think it's a great question, Glenn. Happy to take that and just follow-up on exactly what Ted said, which is as you said, the results really speak for themselves. This is a phenomenal business. We had record revenues and we're in a great position. We have strong margins, strong net new assets, and no, there are no strategic changes to our business. There is no changes in our ability to do business, and we're extremely confident in our ability to grow and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients. Specific to your question on the international business, it is small. I welcome the day where I stopped getting questions on NII. I would characterize this, it's now the third quarter in a row that I've said that our suite models and the client behavior is following client expectations. It does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash. Of course we'll have to wait and see how things play out, but broadly speaking it feels as though like I said we are at a place where you have what we would say is inter quarter volatility associated with things that might be T-bills maturing, people putting things in markets. But that again is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or movements in real client behavior, which is what you saw 2 years ago in the summer when we saw the large move in rates, which was a one off event, and then you had again a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year. So those are very specific events that we can look at and since then, like I said, we have been working with our modeled expectations. Certainly, let's take just the expense big picture and we obviously disclosed the SEC drivers of expenses, I called them out. We've had multiple years now where we've been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions, and as we've come out of that we've been able to reevaluate our expense base. And I've talked about it in different pieces of our earnings call, many times I've mentioned space. You can see even in the lines around occupancy in the actual disclosures, you can see bump ups in spaces where you're taking write offs down in space and then it begins to trend down again. So we're making big picture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest those growth drivers as we move forward. So consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars, consolidating professional services, how do we actually want to deploy full time hires in those growth objectives. So in my prepared remarks, we talked about 2 things. We talked about taking expenses down in certain line items, but we also discussed investments, right. I talked about the fact that we're looking at opportunistic hires in M&A. We've discussed a lot about investing in parametric and technology. We've been giving technological tools to our advisors and investing in the business. So it's a push pull and it's making sure as Ted said that we're sweating the income statement and we're thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move forward through the cycle. Well, what I would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck and we're obviously making progress towards those goals. When you think about what gets you to 30%, the framework that we've offered the investment community is that there is sort of 3 parts to it. The first is migration to advice, the second and really the monetization of the funnel will go through this. The second when you think about it is solutions and products that we're offering, and then the third is the benefits of scale. And what was encouraging about this quarter is that all three of those things happened. The first being the fee based flows that we saw at $26 billion came from brokerage accounts. They came from people taking money that was already in the channel that we said will eventually be deployed, and it is being deployed and that's what you're seeing here. If you look back, it's a, that particular transition, that conversion is at a 2-year peak. Again, encouraging color, Steve. The second piece, solutions, products, differentiated offering. I called out structured products. People have interest in products, as Ted said, as markets begin to improve, those could be new issuance, that can be derivatives, that can be solutions through structured notes. That's what we're seeing beginning to happen here. So yes, again, an encouraging sign. And the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating leverage. So all three things are working, of course there is room to run, but what we're trying to do is make sure that we also have the right tradeoffs between investing in the business, giving ourselves room for technology, and being able to build a 30% margin for sustainable business and durable revenues over time. Sure. I think we've talked about it before, Brennan. But I'm happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason that we point you to the wealth management NII is it's a business driven NII. When we look at the trading NII and we look at firm NII, it really depends on the products that you have, where you're booking them, what you're using as your funding sources. That falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue. So we call, we focus you in from our disclosures really on the wealth management NII when that NII is being driven by a business concept rather than just where you might be booking certain trading trades. No, I would really step you back and tell you that that's not how we manage the business and the trading revenue is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in that quarter. And the wealth management revenue, I've given you the drivers with the deposits, with interest rates, with spreads and with reinvestment and really two separate things that you should looking at. Certainly. So when you're growing the wealth management client assets, it's going to be all sorts of places. Like I said, we begin to see assets, they can come in actually in the brokerage side. And over time they will migrate or can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side. Those different assets are going to have different fees associated with them. For us it's about growing the funnel, Mike, and then beginning to see this movement towards advice. Now I'd also point out that once you're in the advice led channel, even if you're in the fee-based channel, you might not directly be in the S&P. There is a composite, there might be preferences to be in fixed income products, there might be preferences to be in equity products. But for us it's about building sustainable durable revenue over time. First, you bring in the clients and the participants, we've seen the participants grow. Then you bring in the assets. We've seen the assets grow. That then comes into the brokerage accounts, which eventually moves into the advice-based accounts, and we continue to see great trends in the advice driven model, in fee-based assets and the advice the asset management revenues. The asset management revenues, Mike at a record high, so I would just highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working. Sure. So we did see the percentage of client cash. So we've given you I think 22% in the advisory channel is now down to, say, 21%, 20% levels depending on what channels that you're looking at. But that, I would say, is not a function of the actual cash levels coming down, but rather that the equity markets have risen, so just to be clear in terms of the actual mix. The reason I bring up those percentages is they are still high relative to the pre-COVID historical levels of, say, 17%, 18% that we've given on previous calls. So there is still room to see the deployment of cash over time into the markets. Absolutely. I'm so glad you asked, as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it for some time. We launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in 2021. We discussed it on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm, and by that I mean a way to offer our wealth management clients different solutions from institutional securities. So our fund management products, where you're actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way that you would as an institutional client. As we begin to offer new solutions to our clients, these are more ways to get touch points with different and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board. So this is an example of that. The reason we pointed out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels. And so when we say these flows can be lumpy, there are different sales channels across the offering and those different channels have different sales cycles and so therefore you will see ins and outs of various pieces of NNA over time, but in this particular quarter and over the long-term history we have seen a very diversified set of channels. We have the workplace, we obviously have the advice-based relationship, different pieces of stock plan, et cetera that come in through the channel and there is diversification there. Sure. I'll take that. When you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and where we are now, as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more integrated, there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer, be that from a global perspective, if you think about where rates are as just a tangible example, interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations as they think about transactions. There are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think about when you're looking at M&A or you're looking at other corporate deals that you have to do in house for a global franchise. So there are corporate solutions that you see, we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective, and there's also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing, private credit being an example. We're financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly. Yes. I would point you to as you said there is interconnectivity. Remember that I think many of the peers have also mentioned there could have been some pull forward that you saw. It's also been a market that's been open over the course of the last 2 years. So I wouldn't draw these same parallel that you might have seen in M&A or in equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last 2 years, but rather that market especially in IG has been relatively open. When you think about high yield and other non-IG kinds of concepts and of course there is the event related transactions, but from an IG market, that market has been well open over the last 2 years."

            "content": "Good morning, and happy spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We entered 2024 with optimism, encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our institutional and wealth management clients, the quarter was strong. We generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2.02 in earnings per share and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisor to our clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base. We saw greater activity both in the advisor based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net new assets grew by $95 billion. Investment Management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter. Across both wealth and investment management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion advancing toward our $10 trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us regain our leadership position in equity capital markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in investment banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients. [Audio Gap] both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities. As ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement and being judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients, invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate Basel III endgame. Additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I wanted to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with 3 short observations. First, this quarter's wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including strong margins and very strong net new assets. We are really pleased with this terrific performance and we are going to keep ongoing. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world class in every aspect of this growing business. And third, to be clear, this is about processes. We have been spending time, effort and money for multiple years, and it is ongoing. We've been on it. And the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter of 2024 aligns with the goals outlined in the January strategy deck: $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, $7 trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible. We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis. I'm very optimistic what lies ahead for Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of our 2,300 Managing Directors and 80,000 employees, say to those listening to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and in its intensity. Now, I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya to discuss the quarter in more detail. The pipeline is clearly growing. It's growing across sectors. It's growing on a cross border basis. There are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle. And there is activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community will effectively be bidding with and against each other for assets. This is a moment when most want to purify their business model or grow. And that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of COVID and supply chain are in front of us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds, it is not surprising that the C suite wants to act. So I think we are in the early innings of a multiyear M&A cycle. On the back of that, we should continue to see all kinds of underwriting. What was interesting about this ECM quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of IPOs from the Valley, capital raises from industrial companies, regional trades, cross border unlocks. It was the whole potpourri of offerings and we've also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the high yield and leverage loan market. So I'm feeling good about this being early to mid-cycle for the classic investment banking capital markets business around the world. And as you know, we are very active in Japan where we think activity will be heightened for years to come. What I'd add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings, our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group, the management committee of about 3 dozen and then their leadership teams. I think it's fair to say Steve over the last 5 years, a large chunk of time was spent talking about capital efficiency, how we can optimize those toggles and of course with Basel III endgame pending and the annual CCAR process ongoing. We, of course, continue dedicate time to that. But the C change over the last number of quarters and it is accelerated now into 2024 is we're actively talking about the income statement, about delivering earnings growth, earnings momentum that obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter. But we're looking to make investments, strategic investments in top human capital now and then when it comes about, but we're being pretty judicious about that. This is a great platform and we have a great team, but we need to be running this thing super efficiently. And that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of 70% in January was so important and that we put up 71% this quarter where it was a generally constructive environment. I think I called it a relatively constructive environment, but there's clearly more operating leverage to be had when you get to the higher brackets of ISG and then as you move to the funnel of wealth. So the focus on generating that operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership team. Yes, I think it's a reasonable question. The backlogs are all up. I think it will be a slow march back. People are not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the SPAC period clearly. But the receptivity to recent IPOs that were high quality was quite impressive, quite broad interest among investors. The need to execute on cross-border M&A is here. It's for many companies an existential reality. Their supply chains have been disrupted by 2 major global conflicts and they need to near shore and make the trade off, which means they need to potentially bolt on piece of supply chain that's in front of them. They may need to take regulatory risk. There may need to be structuring and financing advice around that so called solutions where we think we're strong. The other motivating piece, Mike, is and I do think there's going to be growing consensus on this. The financial sponsor community is sitting on product that has a 3, 4, 5-year life as a private company ready to come out one way or the other, either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets. That is the best way for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their LPs and keep the thing going with raising ever big funds. So there will be a competitive dynamic I believe between the financial sponsor and corporate community with respect to assets that are available, whether they are public or private in order to continue to create value for their LPs or shareholders. The fact that the U.S. Economy continues to grow, that China is weaker, that parts of Europe are weaker, highlights the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the U.S. With respect to Japan, what's interesting there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets, which is to say they're sitting on enormous yen denominated deposits, but they wish to grow the economy. So that is a market obviously where we're active in the financial sponsor and corporate communities both in and out will continue to be. So, I am quite bullish about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach. It could take several years and have some lumpiness along the way. But I think the next 3, 4, 5 years will be quite active. Yes. What I'd add to that is, to Sharon's point on integrated firm, we have this Sharon made reference to this gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called Fund Services, which caters to alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their LPs. The question that has been asked over the last number of years is, when some of these folks go on to open their family office and manage their own wealth? What about having a product that has the feel of an institutional product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for related business. So the folks in Fund Services got together with the folks in wealth management who run our outsourced CIO product and they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very much in the ultra-high net worth category. And this helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that we've all been focused on over the last number of years, which is the very high net worth space, which is very competitive. But in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and have them work together with the founder in her next life managing a family office. It's actually a nice seamless way to keep the funds in house and to deliver institutional style capability to clients. So this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division and the wealth management folks are working hand in glove to deliver something for clients. And what I would add to that is, we're in the middle of the PE ecosystem. With respect to M&A financing risk, if you ask a number of the asset managers, both real money and alternative asset managers, they would say we are a partner of choice. So opportunity exists within credit, where there's a big focus on the financing side. It's obviously stable revenue and we're getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and inside of our new issue business to originate structure, finance credit, of course, a focus on private credit and then in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives. So this ecosystem around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability, this is a space and a client base that we are focused on along with, of course, our leading strategic clients on the corporate side. The competition is real. And we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem. I think there's going to be room for folks in the private space to participate in deals. But I certainly do not believe as some seem to suggest that the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things don't go well. So I think we're in a world where the ecosystem will at times have many of the players acting as partners. Sometimes we'll act as counterparties and at times even competitors. But I think the ecosystem has more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space, but also the incumbents to continue to be able to do their thing. Well, it's a great question. It depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth in the U.S. or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing, in which case we're in recession and clearly then things will slow down. I think our view is that the U.S. economy continues to progress quite nicely, that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong, both on the institutional side and on the wealth side, and that there is plenty to do and that the higher rates that we see are in part, if not more than in part dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world. But that again speaks to U.S. strength and as you know, first and foremost, we have our activity based in the U.S. But over time, there will be strength in places again like Japan and Europe, and then eventually in the China complex where we will be busy too. So my bullishness is not a mark-to-market on any given week or month. It's a view that corporate boardrooms have been quiet for 3, 4 years and that is not sustainable. They need to move. They're ready to move before the pandemic, then the pandemic came and then there were higher rates. Those higher rates seem to be well absorbed. Yes, now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital, as we saw in prior regimes where cost of capital matter. And now we're in a period that comes after financial repression, where we'll have some inflation and some real rates and companies and financial sponsors will adapt and the strong companies will prosper. So we are setting up for that and we believe will be a multiyear cycle. And I would say finally that what we're most excited about of course is the model that we are working with both the institutional community, but also our wealth management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle."
