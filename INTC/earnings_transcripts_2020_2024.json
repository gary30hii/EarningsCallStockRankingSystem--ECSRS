At this time, all participant lines are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Trey Campbell, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTrey Campbell: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Intel's fourth quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our Chairman of the Board, Omar Ishrak; our incoming CEO, Pat Gelsinger; our current CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, you'll hear brief remarks followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. Given our CEO transition, I want to clarify two points ahead of remarks and Q&A. One, we will be providing Q1 2021 guidance on this call, but will provide full-year guidance for 2021 at a later date, no later than our next earnings call in April. Second, we'll be providing more commentary on our progress on 7-nanometer with specifics on our manufacturing plans for our 2023 products to follow after Pat joins us in mid-February. With that, let me hand it over to Omar.\nOmar Ishrak: Thank you, Trey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you've heard, Intel has been in the midst of a major transformation to strengthen our CPU franchise, while evolving into a multi-architecture XPU company. The business is well-positioned to capitalize on key technology inflections and extend our reach into fast-growing markets. Under Bob's leadership, Intel has made significant progress on this strategy and once again delivered record results in the past year, which Bob and George will detail shortly. But before that, I'd like to share a few words about the CEO transition we announced last week. This decision came after very careful consideration and planning by the Board and in partnership with Bob. Pat Gelsinger will rejoin Intel on February the 15th as our new CEO and a member of our Board. Bob will remain in his role until then and will work with Pat to ensure a seamless transition. On behalf of the entire Intel team and Board of Directors, I'd like to thank Bob for his leadership and significant contributions through this period of transformation for Intel. The company faced challenging issues when Bob took over and he has been a fantastic leader. Bob clarified Intel's growth strategy, reenergized its culture, and made significant progress in improving execution. He leaves Intel in a strong strategic and financial position and we deeply appreciate his ongoing guidance during this transition. Last week, Bob and I introduced Pat to Intel employees around the world who gave him a very warm welcome. We believe this is the right time to make this change and we are confident Pat is the right person to lead Intel forward. In addition to deep technology expertise and unique insights of Intel's technology evolution based on 30 years as a leader here, Pat brings a distinguished record of driving growth and performance and shareholder returns. He lives by our values-based cultural leadership approach and has a hyper focus on talent development and operational execution. In sum, the Board is confident that Pat, together with the rest of the leadership team and our incredible dedicated 110,000 employees around the world, will ensure strong execution of Intel's strategy, build on its record of product leadership, and capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead to create long-term shareholder value. While he does not step into the role for another few weeks, he has kindly agreed to join us today. So, you will get to hear some of his initial observations with more to come after he officially takes over on February the 15th. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat for a few words.\nPat Gelsinger: Thanks, Omar, for the kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. I am thrilled and humbled to be coming home to my dream job as Intel's CEO. I was only 18 when I first joined Intel and I am proud to say I spent the following 30 years learning from such industry giants as Grove, Moore, and Noyce. My experience at Intel has shaped my entire career and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to now lead this great company. I have tremendous regard for Intel's rich history of innovation and the world-changing technologies invented here that now power the world's digital foundation. I can't wait to help lead this great technology innovator during a critical time of change and disruption. I know you're all very anxious to hear more from me on our long-term plans and I'll be sharing my detailed perspective after I assume my new role mid-February. That said, I do want to provide my view specifically on 7-nanometer progress. I've had the opportunity to personally examine progress on Intel's 7-nanometer technology over the last week. Based on initial reviews, I am pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program. I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally. At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it's likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products. We will provide more details on this and our 2023 roadmap once I fully assess the analysis that has been done and the best path forward. Bob and George will walk you through the financials and provide guidance for the first quarter shortly. We are holding off on providing guidance for the full-year until I join, but we will do so in a timely fashion no later than on our next earnings call in April. Looking ahead, the world is becoming more digitally connected, expanding the market in front of us. Intel is the only semiconductor company in the world that has the depth of intelligent silicon, platform vision, design and manufacturing capabilities, and scale that our customers need to fuel their next-generation innovations. There is enormous opportunity ahead for Intel. But to be able to seize these opportunities, we have to deliver the best products and stay ahead of our customers' needs. We need to become more agile in a very competitive market. We need to execute flawlessly and deliver on our commitments. We need to passionately innovate with boldness and speed. Intel culture and values must be healthy and vibrant assuring our ability to attract and retain the best engineering talent in the world. I look forward to working with the incredibly talented global Intel team and industry partners to continue delivering the best technologies for our customers around the world. I also look forward to engaging with you, our shareholders, in the coming months to hear your perspectives and discuss our vision and strategy for Intel. We will position this company for sustained growth and leadership for our industry, our country and an increasingly digital world. I also want to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to Bob for his leadership and significant contributions to Intel through this critical period. I'm just starting to dive into the business, but already I'm confident that the strong foundation and progress achieved under his leadership put us on the right track to build on Intel's great history and to create value for our customers and shareholders in the years to come. Thanks, again. Bob, over to you.\nBob Swan: Thanks, Pat, and welcome back to Intel. It has been an honor to lead this incredible company and its talented team. It gives me great confidence in Intel's future knowing that I'll be passing the baton to Pat, whose technology expertise, industry knowledge, execution track record, and commitment to our company is indisputable. Over the last two years, we made significant progress on our strategy to transform Intel into a multi-architecture XPU company to move from silicon to solutions and to contemporize our IDM model. I am proud of what we're able to achieve together as an Intel team in a relatively short period of time and echo Omar's words that Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this transition. As demonstrated by the results we announced today, demand for Intel's innovative technologies remains very strong and our investments to capitalize on future growth opportunities are paying off. Our Q4 results significantly exceeded our expectations capping off our fifth consecutive year of record revenue. We generated $20 billion in revenue and $1.52 in EPS, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion and $0.42, respectively. For the full year, we delivered $77.9 billion in revenue, up 8% and $5.30 in EPS, up 9%. The client, data center, memory, and Mobileye businesses each set all-time revenue records. In Q4, we continued to advance our three strategic priorities; improving our execution to strengthen our core business, extending our reach to accelerate growth and redefine our position in the industry, and continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital to create value for our shareholders. Let me briefly discuss some of the highlights. Starting with improving our execution to strengthen our core business, let me start with an update on process technology and our product roadmap. Over the last few years, we've been following the IDM model to ensure we can deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve our IDM advantage, continue to invest in process technology leadership, and generate attractive returns on capital. This evolution includes a disaggregated design strategy, adoption of standard industry processes and common tools, flows, and methods, and deeper engagement with the industry ecosystem. In July, we highlighted a challenge with our 7-nanometer technology and started a process to improve it while evaluating the best approach for our 2023 product lineup. Since that time, we have made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer technology. When 7-nanometer was originally defined, the flow contained a particular sequence of steps that contributed to the defect issue we discussed in July. By re-architecting these steps, we've been able to resolve the defects. As part of this work over the last six months, we also streamlined and simplified our 7-nanometer process architecture to better ensure we'll be able to deliver on our 2023 product roadmap. The inline data we have been collecting and our pipeline of proven yield development projects gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments going forward. At the same time, as Pat mentioned, we will continue to leverage the relationships we've developed over the years with our external foundry partners and believe they can play a larger role in our product roadmap given our disaggregated designs. Once Pat has had a chance to join, he'll further assess our analysis and drive the final manufacturing decision for our 2023 CPU products. Therefore, we'll communicate that decision soon after he takes over, but not today. Turning to products, we've qualified several new products in the fourth quarter and we have an incredibly exciting lineup of CPUs for 2021 and 2022. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we introduced more than 50 processors resulting in more than 500 new designs for laptops and desktops coming to market in 2021. We are also seeing tremendous market response for PCs based on our new 11th Gen Intel Core Tiger Lake Processors. Our PC customers now have more than 150 Tiger Lake based systems in the market, well ahead of expectations. We believe we gained market share as PC CPU units grew an impressive 33% in the quarter. In a market where competitors are seeing supply challenges, this is a powerful example of the incredible value and scale of our factory network as we continue to deliver greater performance and cost efficiencies for our customers. Moving to data center, we are now shipping our first 10-nanometer based Xeon Scalable CPU Ice Lake and will be ramping volume through the first quarter. Customers are going to see significant value in Ice Lake across cloud, network, and edge workloads with excellent performance improvement and innovations such as PCIe Express Gen 4, next generation Intel Optane Persistent Memory and security enhancements such as SGX. As we look ahead, we are excited about the capabilities we are bringing to customers with Alder Lake for mobile and desktop PCs and Sapphire Rapids for the data center. These products take advantage of our Enhanced SuperFin process technology and numerous architectural improvements and both are broadly sampling to customers. We will qualify Alder Lake desktop and notebook for production and begin our volume ramp in the second half of 2021 and we expect production qualification of Sapphire Rapids at the end of 2021. In the expanded market opportunity in front of us, CPUs are critical, but multiple architectures or XPUs will be required to help customers optimize for specific workloads. We had a big XPU leap in the fourth quarter as we entered the discrete graphics market with Intel Iris Xe MAX graphics, Intel's first Xe-based discrete GPU. We are now shipping discrete graphics into thin and light notebooks from Acer, Asus, and Dell and we introduced our first discrete GPU for the data center, which is already delivering great cloud gaming experiences for customers such as Tencent. We also announced the gold release of oneAPI, our cross-industry open standards-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across architectures. Second, we've made strong progress extending our reach to accelerate our growth. Over the past several years, we have been making investments that have positioned us to lead key technology inflections such as AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent autonomous edge. We infuse AI capabilities into everything we make from the cloud to PCs and we see tremendous growth prospects as we build our position in data center training to complement the strength of our Intel Xeon for inference. We made a significant step in AI this quarter when Amazon announced EC2 instances that will leverage up to eight of our Habana Gaudi AI training accelerators and deliver up to 40% better price performance than current GPU-based EC2 instances for machine learning workloads. We've also invested to drive networking workload convergence on Intel silicon. In 2020, we expanded our footprint into the Radio Access Network delivering Xeon SoCs, FPGAs, and custom solutions for 5G base station designs and reaching our goal of 40% share, two years ahead of our original target. Today, we are the leading network silicon provider winning in wireless, enterprise, and cloud networks and delivering $6 billion in revenue this year, up approximately 20% versus 2019. Finally, we have enviable assets to lead the explosive growth of intelligent and autonomous edge computing. Our IOTG and Mobileye businesses have a combined annual revenue of $4 billion. Mobileye delivered a record fourth quarter and had an explosive start to 2021 with a number of exciting CES announcements. Third, we've maintained our discipline in thoughtfully allocating our shareholders' capital. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more than $22 billion and more than doubled EPS. We've driven spending from 36% of revenue to 25% of revenue, while investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, adding more than $1 billion of R&D targeted to higher growth initiatives, and focusing our product portfolio. As a result, we anticipate approximately $12 billion in proceeds from our NAND and McAfee exits over time. At the same time, we've been delivering substantial capital returns to shareholders, including $19.8 billion in 2020 alone through dividends and share buybacks, the latter of which included a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase announced in August. Building on this, today, we announced that we are increasing our annual dividend by $0.07 or 5% from $1.32 to $1.39 per share. Before I pass it to George for more details on our fourth quarter results, I want to reiterate that I couldn't be more proud of the team at Intel and I cherish the time I've spent here. I look forward to watching Pat and the team's continued progress as they build on Intel's purpose to deliver breakthrough technology that enriches the lives of everyone on the planet. I also thank our investors and analysts on the line today for their continued support of Intel and for our valued engagements over the years.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Q4 marked a much stronger than expected finish to a record year. Both Mobileye and our PC-centric segment achieved record quarters. Q4 revenue was $20 billion, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion. The revenue beat was broad based led by stronger than expected notebook and cloud demand along with contributions from desktop and enterprise and government. Data center related demand also led to stronger revenues in NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by three points due to flow through on higher revenue and the benefit of Ice Lake server achieving production qualification prior to year end. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.42 above our guide due to strong operational performance and further boosted by gains from our ICAP portfolio. Excluding a one-time tax adjustment, about two-thirds of our EPS beat was operational and one-third was below the line. For full year 2020, we achieved record revenue of $77.9 billion, $4.4 billion higher than our January guide, which reflects a one year acceleration relative to our 2019 Investor Day target. EPS was $5.30, up $0.43 year-over-year and $0.30 higher than our January guide. We generated $21.1 billion of free cash flow, up 25% year-on-year and returned 94% of free cash flow to shareholders. In total, we have repurchased approximately 17.6 billion shares as part of our planned $20 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance in Q1 2021. Moving briefly the segment performance, our data center group generated record revenue in 2020, up 11% year-over-year. In Q4, DCG delivered revenue of $6.1 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by enterprise and government weakness and cloud digestion albeit lower than expected. As a reminder, Q4 2019 was a tough compare with an all-time record for revenue with strength across all segments. DCG operating margin in Q4 was down $1.4 billion year-on-year on lower revenue and increased investment. Our other data centric businesses were up 1% year-over-year in 2020. In Q4, these businesses were down 5% year-over-year, driven largely by COVID-related demand impacts, partially offset by Mobileye growth. IOTG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to COVID effects on demand. We expect recovery in IOTG in 2021 and saw sequential growth of $100 million in the quarter on stabilizing industrial and video segments. Mobileye revenue was up 39% year-over-year in the quarter and operating margin was $110 million, both records as IQSoC demand continues to be strong. NSG revenue was $1.2 billion, down 1% year-on-year on lower ASPs, partially offset by higher volume growth. Operating margin was $76 million. PSG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due mostly to 5G ASIC transitions at key accounts in the communications segment. CCG delivered a fifth straight year of record revenue, up 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by record notebook unit volume. ASPs were down 11% due to increased volume in consumer entry and education segments. Adjacency revenue was down 31% driven by modem ramp down and the divestiture of our home gateway business. Operating income was $4.5 billion, up $420 million year-over-year on higher volume, partially offset by the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Moving to our outlook, as Bob and Trey said, we believe it is important to give Pat time to assume his new role and dig into the business before announcing our full year 2021 guidance and longer term plans. However, I will provide our Q1 outlook and then for the year, discuss high-level headwinds and tailwinds we expect. As a reminder, our outlook for 2021 excludes the NAND business. We expect Q1 revenue of $17.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year or down 6% excluding NAND. We see continuing strong demand for notebook PCs in Q1, up significantly year-over-year and expect desktop volumes to be down year-over-year. We anticipate further cloud digestion and continued COVID demand impacts on IOTG. The Q1 revenue estimate also includes approximately $500 million in corporate revenue that is one-time in nature and relates to a prepaid revenue arrangement. As we look at the remainder of the year, we see solid TAM growth in our core markets in 2021. We expect PC demand to be more first-half weighted than normal seasonality and expect data centric demand to be more concentrated in the second half as cloud digestion eases and COVID impacted markets such as enterprise, data center, and IoT improve. We have strong product roadmaps, but have anticipated a more competitive market and the continued mix shift to entry consumer PCs in our revenue plans this year. Finally, we will see lower modem revenue this year from our exit of that business. Gross margin in Q1 is expected to be approximately 58%, down year-over-year by approximately four points on mix-related ASPs from lower Xeon XCC volume and higher small core PC units partially offset by lower margin impact from divested businesses and some improvements from our DCG adjacencies. Q1 operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. We are forecasting EPS of approximately $1.10 per share and a tax rate of 14.5%. With that, let me turn it back over to Trey and get to your questions.\nTrey Campbell: All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Bob, it's been a pleasure working with you, and Pat, congrats and best of luck. I guess first question is around the fact, clearly, a final decision hasn't been made yet, but it certainly sounds pretty clear that you are pursuing a dual path strategy of manufacturing at the leading edge both internally and externally. So, how should we think about the impact to CapEx? Will you need to make investments with your foundry partner to secure capacity and importing certain products to very different foundry design rules, what impact will that have on OpEx? And is that what is driving higher OpEx intensity in Q1? Thank you.\nBob Swan: Yes, thanks, C.J. Maybe I'll start, and George, you can finish up. First, yes, we've been through an exhaustive effort over the course of the last six months. And as we highlighted, we've made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer process technology and that gives us a lot of comfort that the number one priority that we set in the middle of the year, which was a predictable cadence of leadership products that we would be able to deliver our 2023 roadmap using i7 or for our next-gen technology. So, the progress that the team has made has given us the confidence that we'll continue to leverage the IDM advantage and invest in technology development leadership in the future. At the same time, we also realize that with our disaggregated designs that we launched a few years back, that we have enhanced flexibility to see if when and what technologies or tiles we'll make inside, which will be the majority of our 2023 roadmap, but it gives us the flexibility to look at things outside. And the trade-offs that we make in doing that are one, performance of product in a predictable manner; two, economics; and three, ensuring that we have the capacity and the control of the supply chain, so that we can -- our customers can count on our deliveries. So, over the course in time preserving the IDM advantage while being more and more flexible on our architectures and our designs.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. And, C.J., in terms of spending, I would say, yes, we're increasing spending on 7-nanometer inside the company in preparation for the next-generation of tools. I wouldn't tie it explicitly in any way to the trade-off between manufacturing internally or externally. That's really going to be decided as Pat looks at the product roadmap. Most of our spending increase in the year compared to what we thought is tied to more spending on AI and on our Xeon roadmap, which pretty much was a redirection of the savings that we got from the divestitures.\nPat Gelsinger: And if I might, C.J., this is Pat, pleasure to join all of the investors on this call today. I just want to affirm, as I said in my formal statements, that I was very pleased to see the great progress on 7-nanometers and the TD team has really done a great job over the last six months. That gives me the confidence, as I said in my formal comments, that the majority will be internally, but we will be increasing the use of our foundry capabilities as well and we'll be more specific on this after I finally dig deeper with the team shortly after joining the company in the middle of next month. But overall, I think we're on a very good path now.\nC.J. Muse: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I'll echo C.J. in thanking Bob for all his help and welcoming Pat to the team. I guess my question, Bob, probably just around gross margins. Clearly, you significantly upside the December quarter. I would have thought that going into March, given the divestiture of NAND and that being gross margin accretive that maybe you'd get some better leverage on gross margin. So, maybe you can address that. And I guess more importantly, from the March quarter, Bob or George, can you talk about how we should think about the puts and takes to the cost sides on gross margins as 10-nanometer begins to ramp?\nGeorge Davis: Hey, John, I'll take it. This is George. In Q1, what we're really seeing is again atypical seasonality. So, when you look at the fact that we're in a digestion phase and we're actually in the third quarter of it, that has a significant impact on mix that's affecting our ASPs. You're also seeing tremendous demand in PCs well above our expectations, obviously, contributing to the beat in Q4, continuing into Q1 and actually, we think continuing strongly into the first-half and that's largely small core type devices. So, we have an ASP effect there as well. We are seeing some higher 7-nanometer costs impacting the \u2013 our outlook for gross margin and we are getting the benefit from NAND as you talk about, and -- but we're also seeing more savings in 10-nanometer costs as we're making more progress there than we\u2019ve \u2013 than actually we were even expecting. It's accelerating, so we're pleased with that. As you think about the full-year, I think trying to take a compare off of Q1 when we are impacted on ASPs both from DCG and from CCG makes for a difficult full-year extrapolation. We're going to come back to you with a full-year outlook and we can go more into it. But in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that we see as we go into the year, obviously, we're going to have higher 10-nanometer volume, which is going to impact gross margins overall. The client mix is going to continue to be heavily weighted, particularly in the first-half on small core. I think on data center, we think there will continue to be competitive pressures on ASPs, but I think DCG is really going to be more of a cost story with 10-nanometer coming in. Although we're much further along on the maturity of 10-nanometer, so it won't be as impactful as we saw with CCG last year. And then, of course, for DCG, you can expect the inclusion of Optane will have a little bit of impact on margin as well. So, the tailwinds still look very strong. Obviously, the ramp down on modem, our divestiture of the gateway business, the sale of NAND, and improvements in 10-nanometer are all tailwinds that should help us in gross margin, but we'll go into more detail on that when we guide the full-year.\nBob Swan: Yes. And I would -- I'd put maybe, John, just I think history here as a reasonably good indicator of the commentary that George provided for 2021. And if you go back a year, we said gross margins would be 59% for 2020 and we ended up at 57.5%. So, down 1.5 points. And if you look at the fundamental drivers of that 1.5 points versus what we thought at the beginning of the year,first, we generated $4 billion more revenue than we thought. So, volume was much higher. And then when you look at the makeup of that volume, it was -- in my mind, it was all good things that foreshadow important things for 2021 and beyond. First, the demand for our 10-nanometer products was much -- was higher -- greater than we expected and that was very positive in terms of income, but slight degradation in gross margin. Second, the PC demand that we experienced during the course of the year which relative to where we were at the beginning of the year was off the charts, including what we believe were share gains in the fourth quarter came predominantly with consumer entry and education. So, those two segments tend to be lower margin, but real strong demand and that was the gap that we didn't fill when we were capacity constrained last year. So, I think in terms of the mix of more 10-nanometer, much more PC demand at the lower ends, those were things that drove down less margin percent, but a lot more income than we expected a year ago. And those things as George mentioned going into 2021 are going to be -- you're going to have a much better mix because of the exit of modem and NAND, number one. Number two, 10-nanometer product cost, as George mentioned, is going to get much better during the course of the year. Number three, 14-nanometer is going to be more fully depreciated equipment. Those three things are very positive as we go into the year. At the same time, George flagged two issues, one of those mix dynamics of PC TAM we think is going to be relatively strong, but we do believe it's going to be at the lower-end. Education will be a big part of that demand that has lower margin and we renewed our commitment to 7-nanometer process technology and that, in fact, will have a degradation. So, in so many ways, we generated a lot more income and revenue in 2020 as the adoption of our better -- of our 10-nanometer products and lower end in consumer were very positive impacts for earnings and those trends you'll see as we go in the first quarter and throughout 2021.\nJohn Pitzer: That's a great explanation. Thanks Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if we could drill down on the progress on 7-nanometer. If I look back at the comments from July, you had talked about having your first client product first half of 2023. Is that still the right -- I know, I don't want be too granular about timeframe, but it seems like early 2023 versus late 2023 would make a big difference. Are you still kind of on the track that you talked about in July for the first 7-nanometer output?\nBob Swan: Yes, I think at the time we said that in effect, given the process challenges we were dealing with the product roadmap, we expected to shift a couple quarters into 2023 and as normal client will likely go first and server will go after that. So, the expectation is in our focus in improving 7-nanometer so that we can hit that predictable cadence of leadership products in 2023, we have dramatically improved our confidence in our ability to hit that product roadmap schedule that we talked about at the time.\nJoe Moore: That's very helpful. Thanks very much and congratulations and thanks for all your help the last few years.\nBob Swan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations and best wishes to Bob and band. One of my questions is if you're saying Intel will get to 7-nanometer by 2023, the competitive foundry products will still be one node ahead. TSMC is planning to ramp their 3-nanometer node next year, right and will probably have a much bigger ramp by 2023. So, I'm curious what does Intel need to do to kind of match or leapfrog foundry capability because in the two or three years that you were trying to get to your 7-nanometer, competition several with ARM-based capabilities is still making progress. So, I'm just trying to think to what is kind of a conceptual state of competitive play when we get to 2023? Thank you.\nBob Swan: Yes, Vivek, two things and we've talked about this a bit over the last couple of years, but first, our belief on delivering leadership products over time is going to be dependent on a multitude of factors. Process technology is very important, packaging technologies becomes increasingly important in our mind, a multitude of architectures, CPU to XPU or including graphics and AI capabilities, memory, security and last but not least software and you'll remember that we talked about those as the six pillars of technology required to deliver product leadership where process is very important, but it's not the only thing. So, that's kind of the strategy we've been on for the last couple of years. But secondly, we're going to continue to invest in process technology. So, yes, some of the progress we made on 7-nanometers over the last couple of quarters is important for the next generation of process technology. So, as we leverage our six pillars of technology to deliver leadership product, we will also continue to invest in next generation process technology beyond 7-nanometer.\nPat Gelsinger: Let me just add a couple of points to that. This is Pat again. As we said, we believe the majority will be on our 7-nanometers, but we will be increasing the use of foundry capabilities in that timeframe as well. Overall, it is about building as Bob said, a competitive product that is leadership in the marketplace and that's what our intent is to do and as we broaden the use of our technologies across packaging, software, internal and external, we are confident that we can deliver a leadership product family in the marketplace across all of our major product categories. Additionally, I was also very pleased to see some of the long-term innovations coming out of TD right as we work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as leap ahead and clearly we're not interested in just closing gaps, we're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology and that's our commitment. Also with the IDM model, we believe we have the right combination of being able to deliver supply to meet our customers' requirements by leveraging internal and external capabilities which our competition doesn't have and between all of these capabilities, we believe we are striking the right balance of internal and external to deliver an unquestioned leadership product in the marketplace that meets our customers' requirements for the long-term.\nVivek Arya: Thank you, Bob, Pat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you very much, Bob. Thanks, I really enjoyed my interactions with you. I had a question for you, Pat and I don't believe everything I read in the press, but, and even if you did look at the opportunity earlier. I just wanted to get a feel from you, what really appealed to you when you looked at this opportunity versus your very successful stint at VMware and especially in light of the challenges Intel has had which we could argue, Bob inherited from before. So, can you just help us understand kind of what are the challenges and the opportunities that you saw, which got you to this role again and welcome back by the way.\nPat Gelsinger: Well, thank you very much and a few general comments would be, one is, this is a great company and one that I have just great history with as I said 30 years as part of this company, Grove, Moore, Noyce, these are the people that I grew up right at their feet of learning and to me, it really is a privilege and an honor to come back to this company, as I said, my dream job. Second, this is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry for technology in America and to me it's an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in a technology leadership position. So, I'm excited by that opportunity to do that. It was also very exciting to see the unity of the Board in calling me to the role and with that working closely with the Board and their enthusiasm to bring me into the company as well as the alignment on the look forward strategy that we're laying out and those together. And I say the timing wasn't necessarily, I was enjoying my time at VMware, but the opportunity to come back now, be a part of this great company and Intel has gone through cycles before and clearly, as I was here, economic cycles, we've had periods where we were ahead and periods where we were behind others. Personally, I was very involved in the period where we were very right diminished in the marketplace and late to the multi-core and in that period of time in 2005 through 2009, we turned around the company and unquestionably established the leadership position after a period where many were questioning the ability of the company to be successful yet again. Great companies are able to come back from periods of difficulty in challenge and they come back stronger, better, and more capable than ever and that I believe is the opportunity at Intel and I'm confident that this company has its best days in front of it and I am looking forward to the opportunity to be part of that.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Thanks Pat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and Pat, welcome to Intel, glad to see you here. I'm going to address the elephant in the room a little bit and Pat I understand your initial perspective on 7-nanometer from looking at it for a short period of time. But at the same time, which I've got to say is the company was telling us for a year that 7-nanometer was on track, that it looked great and then all of the sudden, it wasn't to the point of considering potentially massive strategic shifts. So, now I guess how can we as investors have confidence that after a brief look that you've given it at this point that things really are on track. What are you seeing that gives you that confidence and how should we think about the current process and I guess and how they feed into the risks potentially the future nodes since it sounds like you're sticking around on the total manufacturing, especially just given what we've seen at both 7-nanometers, but also 10-nanometers and 14-nanometers, the last several nodes where we've had problems, like how do we get that confidence?\nPat Gelsinger: Well, I would also say that Bob and the team have been working on this for the last six months diligently. So, even though my investigation was really just a few days, I'm looking at data that's been thoroughly analyzed, trends over the last six months that clearly is bringing them to a point of greater confidence for. I looked at that data, I came to the same decisions that they were. At the same time, we're pausing, right, to say that everything is resolved to give me a little bit more time with the team to understand the roadmap and to dig deeper into those decisions and like we said, we'll be giving more clarity on that in the near future after I've had time to analyze it more carefully. Also, the team has been making adjustments of leadership. Ann has been doing a great job as we moved her into that role. You'll be seeing we're making adjustments in the leadership of our product development teams as well where talent is going to come into the company. We're excited about the roadmap that we're on. You might have seen we just announced a new fellow coming back, one of my absolute favorites when I was here in Glenn Hinton coming back to the company and you'll be seeing other announcements of key leaders coming back in. So, I think the team has been doing a great job getting us to this point. I expect with the leadership, the roadmap, and a few more weeks of analysis, we'll be making very solid decisions that allow us to put the company on a path that is merited to the great foundation that Intel has had in the past.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. Good luck.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Want to welcome back Pat to the team and Bob, thank you for all the contributions and support over the past few years. Underlying the strong performance of the data center group last year was the continued penetration of Xeon, ASICs, and networking connectivity solutions into your large 5G service provider customers as they continue to virtualize the core and radio access parts of their networks. I think this helped to drive the 50% growth in data center adjacencies last year. Your networking compute segment was $6 billion and up 20% as you mentioned. So, just given the continued build-out of 5G this year, does the team continue to see double-digit type of growth profile for the networking compute segment this year and compute networking has been a segment where Intel I think still owns a 100% share in the x86 server CPU market. Are you guys starting to see competition stepping it up in this fast-growing segment?\nBob Swan: Thanks for the question. You gave most of my answer in your inquisition. I mean, first is we've been saying for the last couple of years that we view 5G and network transformation as a significant opportunity for us to expand the role we play as more and more compute moves from the data center to the cloud to the network and those dumb pipes become smarter and smarter pipes. So, this has been a pretty large thrust for us for the last several years. We've made tremendous progress in migrating a custom-oriented environment to general purpose compute and that has been a big source of growth from a $1 billion business probably five or six years ago to $5 billion last year. That came primarily by leveraging the core GPU in the network environment, but a couple of years ago to your question, we expanded the role that we thought we could play as more and more compute happened at the network and that included moving into the radio access space with more -- with general purpose compute, but also custom architectures including FPGAs and ASICs and that allowed us to play a much bigger role in our customers' success and a key emerging technology that we've been focused on for a while. So, I think that maybe one other point that I would make that we've gone -- we targeted about 20% share in that radio access space by 2022 and we hit that 40% share in 2020. So, we're well ahead of where we expected. The role we play at 5G and the network is much bigger. We've developed partnerships along the way in this space including with VMware. So, I can only imagine those partnerships and complementary capabilities will allow us to play a bigger and bigger role as more and more compute moves to the network and to the edge.\nPat Gelsinger: And if I might pile on to this one, as Bob had said, Bob and I had struck a partnership when I was in my VMware role and I've been driving the 5G strategy at VMware. So, this is one I'm actually quite intimate with and the opportunity at 5G is it becomes a horizontal versus a vertically-controlled industry is absolutely enormous, but it's even more important than that because 5G is going to represent a platform that is redefining edge computing, it will open up smart cities, smart factories, it will displace Wi-Fi. This is a powerful technology; it will also be deployed in private 5G environments as well. So, not only is Intel establishing a beachhead in a very important market that was never a major source of revenue forward in the past, but it is redefining all aspects of distributed computing in the future. So, this leadership position that is established today is one that we'll be harvesting for the next decade and 5G isn't just faster LTE, it is a new network with increased security, connectivity, bandwidth, better than wired capabilities, and truly will open up markets as we've never seen before. This one is exciting and the leadership position that's already been established here will be harvested for many, many years to come.\nHarlan Sur: Thank you for the insights.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks Bob for everything. Pat, welcome home. I guess my question is a bigger picture one and Pat, you had mentioned a little bit about this in one of your previous answers and I guess the question is to Omar, yourself, and to Bob. No secret that Intel's success is hugely critical to U.S. competitiveness in the long-term on several pillars of technology. I wonder, Pat, your decision to come back, Omar your decision and the Board's decision to make the CEO change and go in that direction, how much of that influenced that and what the interactions with governments -- U.S. government, the Israeli government et cetera, what those conversations have been like in support of Intel? Thanks.\nOmar Ishrak: Well, let me take that one. First of all, the Board has a succession planning process, which we are looking at and we felt that this was the right time to make the move in partnership with Bob and there was no real government influence or anything like that in this decision. So, this was part of our regular process and we're just delighted to have Pat join us at this time and we're confident he can take this company to the next level as he's been saying and thanks to Bob for what he's done. So, there was no other motive other than the regular succession planning process that the Board does have.\nBob Swan: And then on the specific question about the dynamics and discussion with kind of the U.S. government or maybe just our foundry capabilities, I would just -- we've been talking about this for a couple of years and I think the implications of a couple of years ago, increased trade tariffs, now more increasing trade restrictions. At the time, we saw that as a challenge because China is a large market for us, but also was a big opportunity and the big opportunity were on two fronts. In the event of an increasingly East versus West world, we saw an opportunity for us to play a bigger role in 5G. So, we talked about that and I think as a result of the incremental investments we've made, the team has made tremendous progress on our 5G space. At the same time, we also talked about addressing a growing need in an East versus West world where there are dual supply chains and increased anxiety about having all your technology dependencies more in the East. So, for us what that meant was engaging both with the U.S. government and with commercial players who just were increasingly anxious about their exposures and what we've heard from the U.S. government is one, we need advanced access to advanced microelectronics technology and manufacturing here in the U.S. We need greater industrial manufacturing base here in the U.S. and we need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S. and with those with those three things, and this is both U.S. government and commercial customers, we're the only company that can really check all three boxes. So, along the way, as you know, Matt, we told the U.S. government that we would be in a position to, for the good of the industry, frankly, for the good of the country, for the good of Intel, we would leverage our competencies, our capabilities to provide foundry services to the U.S. government and then been working very closely because foundry services requires scale, how do we make sure that we have the technology that can be both USG needs and commercial players' needs. And that's a dialog that has been back and forth for a while and we think we've played a role both with ourselves and the Semiconductor Industry Association in trying to shape some of the incentives coming out of Washington that in effect do a more effective job in leveling the playing field to invest in foundry services here in the U.S.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much Bob. That was helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi thanks. I guess I had a broader question on just captive versus foundry as well. And Bob you had an interview I think maybe it was a month ago, maybe it was six weeks ago where you talked about licensing or the possibility to basically license a process from a foundry rather than just strictly outsourcing to a foundry and you said that, yes, that is actually possible that you could do that. I mean that would be quite a tectonic shift and I guess since Pat is also on the phone, I just wanted to ask you is this something that's remotely on the table as you sort of think about this? Thanks.\nBob Swan: Well, I'll be a little more generic. I think what I said is that our focus is on how do you deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve IDM advantages, and invest in technology development and along the way as a company be much more open and engaging with the ecosystem to make sure we understand the inherent technologies that are out there and embrace technologies to the extent they might be better than what we have or not as critical in the determination of product performance differentiation. So, that said, what we've characterized is just engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way and broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well. So, that's -- I just think it goes back to how do we take this wonderful business model called IDM where we co-optimize, design, and manufacturing, we make all the money and we control the supply chain, how do we evolve that very powerful business model in an industry and an ecosystem that's made dramatic advancements over the last 10 years where we think we can be more open minded in engaging and leveraging those.\nPat Gelsinger: And I would just add to that this will certainly be a topic that we'll discuss as I go forward with the company. Also that clearly this ability to work more closely with the equipment suppliers, right, the CAD tool suppliers, other technology sources in the industry. We're committed to the IDM model, we're committed to leadership products, but also innovation that fundamentally has us leading the industry on a consistent basis and sometimes that may happen outside of the company, sometimes it will be inside of the company, but we're committed to leading innovation and delivering the best products for our customers in every category that we participate in.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks. Good luck to you both.\nTrey Campbell: Yeah, thank you. And Pat, I'm just going to give maybe a few minutes here at the end for you to frame out your priorities as we leave the call and just give you a few seconds to do that.\nPat Gelsinger: Great, thank you, Trey and thanks again to Bob and really is incredible to come back home and have my dream job and thank you, Bob, for being the vehicle to deliver that up to me. Four areas that I touched on briefly in my formal comments that you'll see me focus on as I come into the company. One is great products, right, where we simply will be the leader in every category that we participate. You'll see me dive into details, we'll build out the partnerships with our customers, but we're going to deliver leadership products and have a development machine that consistently does that. Then, execution, obviously, we have to regain the confidence of our customers that our supply chain is the best; that our roadmap is the best; that they can rely on us for their products and their strategies for the future. Innovation, we're going to continue to be a source, a fountain, a continual delivery vehicle for the greatest innovations of the industry. We'll be doing that with the IDM model, 7-nanometers beyond, but continuing to find radical areas to innovate because the world is looking for more digital technology as more and more of every aspect of humanity is coming online and coming to the digital foundation that we uniquely build and deliver. And finally culture, I was trained at the feet of Grove and we will have the Grovian maniac execution, transparent data driven culture and rebuilding that as part of this company. And as we look across these areas, as I said, I'm convinced the best days for this company are in front of us and this is a priority for Intel, a priority for the technology industry and our nation and it is a sovereign duty, responsibility, and opportunity for me to be taking on that role. Thank you all for joining us today.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks Pat and thank you all for joining us. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Q4 marked a much stronger than expected finish to a record year. Both Mobileye and our PC-centric segment achieved record quarters. Q4 revenue was $20 billion, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion. The revenue beat was broad based led by stronger than expected notebook and cloud demand along with contributions from desktop and enterprise and government. Data center related demand also led to stronger revenues in NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by three points due to flow through on higher revenue and the benefit of Ice Lake server achieving production qualification prior to year end. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.42 above our guide due to strong operational performance and further boosted by gains from our ICAP portfolio. Excluding a one-time tax adjustment, about two-thirds of our EPS beat was operational and one-third was below the line. For full year 2020, we achieved record revenue of $77.9 billion, $4.4 billion higher than our January guide, which reflects a one year acceleration relative to our 2019 Investor Day target. EPS was $5.30, up $0.43 year-over-year and $0.30 higher than our January guide. We generated $21.1 billion of free cash flow, up 25% year-on-year and returned 94% of free cash flow to shareholders. In total, we have repurchased approximately 17.6 billion shares as part of our planned $20 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance in Q1 2021. Moving briefly the segment performance, our data center group generated record revenue in 2020, up 11% year-over-year. In Q4, DCG delivered revenue of $6.1 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by enterprise and government weakness and cloud digestion albeit lower than expected. As a reminder, Q4 2019 was a tough compare with an all-time record for revenue with strength across all segments. DCG operating margin in Q4 was down $1.4 billion year-on-year on lower revenue and increased investment. Our other data centric businesses were up 1% year-over-year in 2020. In Q4, these businesses were down 5% year-over-year, driven largely by COVID-related demand impacts, partially offset by Mobileye growth. IOTG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to COVID effects on demand. We expect recovery in IOTG in 2021 and saw sequential growth of $100 million in the quarter on stabilizing industrial and video segments. Mobileye revenue was up 39% year-over-year in the quarter and operating margin was $110 million, both records as IQSoC demand continues to be strong. NSG revenue was $1.2 billion, down 1% year-on-year on lower ASPs, partially offset by higher volume growth. Operating margin was $76 million. PSG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due mostly to 5G ASIC transitions at key accounts in the communications segment. CCG delivered a fifth straight year of record revenue, up 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by record notebook unit volume. ASPs were down 11% due to increased volume in consumer entry and education segments. Adjacency revenue was down 31% driven by modem ramp down and the divestiture of our home gateway business. Operating income was $4.5 billion, up $420 million year-over-year on higher volume, partially offset by the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Moving to our outlook, as Bob and Trey said, we believe it is important to give Pat time to assume his new role and dig into the business before announcing our full year 2021 guidance and longer term plans. However, I will provide our Q1 outlook and then for the year, discuss high-level headwinds and tailwinds we expect. As a reminder, our outlook for 2021 excludes the NAND business. We expect Q1 revenue of $17.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year or down 6% excluding NAND. We see continuing strong demand for notebook PCs in Q1, up significantly year-over-year and expect desktop volumes to be down year-over-year. We anticipate further cloud digestion and continued COVID demand impacts on IOTG. The Q1 revenue estimate also includes approximately $500 million in corporate revenue that is one-time in nature and relates to a prepaid revenue arrangement. As we look at the remainder of the year, we see solid TAM growth in our core markets in 2021. We expect PC demand to be more first-half weighted than normal seasonality and expect data centric demand to be more concentrated in the second half as cloud digestion eases and COVID impacted markets such as enterprise, data center, and IoT improve. We have strong product roadmaps, but have anticipated a more competitive market and the continued mix shift to entry consumer PCs in our revenue plans this year. Finally, we will see lower modem revenue this year from our exit of that business. Gross margin in Q1 is expected to be approximately 58%, down year-over-year by approximately four points on mix-related ASPs from lower Xeon XCC volume and higher small core PC units partially offset by lower margin impact from divested businesses and some improvements from our DCG adjacencies. Q1 operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. We are forecasting EPS of approximately $1.10 per share and a tax rate of 14.5%. With that, let me turn it back over to Trey and get to your questions. Yes. And, C.J., in terms of spending, I would say, yes, we're increasing spending on 7-nanometer inside the company in preparation for the next-generation of tools. I wouldn't tie it explicitly in any way to the trade-off between manufacturing internally or externally. That's really going to be decided as Pat looks at the product roadmap. Most of our spending increase in the year compared to what we thought is tied to more spending on AI and on our Xeon roadmap, which pretty much was a redirection of the savings that we got from the divestitures. Hey, John, I'll take it. This is George. In Q1, what we're really seeing is again atypical seasonality. So, when you look at the fact that we're in a digestion phase and we're actually in the third quarter of it, that has a significant impact on mix that's affecting our ASPs. You're also seeing tremendous demand in PCs well above our expectations, obviously, contributing to the beat in Q4, continuing into Q1 and actually, we think continuing strongly into the first-half and that's largely small core type devices. So, we have an ASP effect there as well. We are seeing some higher 7-nanometer costs impacting the \u2013 our outlook for gross margin and we are getting the benefit from NAND as you talk about, and -- but we're also seeing more savings in 10-nanometer costs as we're making more progress there than we've \u2013 than actually we were even expecting. It's accelerating, so we're pleased with that. As you think about the full-year, I think trying to take a compare off of Q1 when we are impacted on ASPs both from DCG and from CCG makes for a difficult full-year extrapolation. We're going to come back to you with a full-year outlook and we can go more into it. But in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that we see as we go into the year, obviously, we're going to have higher 10-nanometer volume, which is going to impact gross margins overall. The client mix is going to continue to be heavily weighted, particularly in the first-half on small core. I think on data center, we think there will continue to be competitive pressures on ASPs, but I think DCG is really going to be more of a cost story with 10-nanometer coming in. Although we're much further along on the maturity of 10-nanometer, so it won't be as impactful as we saw with CCG last year. And then, of course, for DCG, you can expect the inclusion of Optane will have a little bit of impact on margin as well. So, the tailwinds still look very strong. Obviously, the ramp down on modem, our divestiture of the gateway business, the sale of NAND, and improvements in 10-nanometer are all tailwinds that should help us in gross margin, but we'll go into more detail on that when we guide the full-year."

            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Omar, for the kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. I am thrilled and humbled to be coming home to my dream job as Intel's CEO. I was only 18 when I first joined Intel and I am proud to say I spent the following 30 years learning from such industry giants as Grove, Moore, and Noyce. My experience at Intel has shaped my entire career and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to now lead this great company. I have tremendous regard for Intel's rich history of innovation and the world-changing technologies invented here that now power the world's digital foundation. I can't wait to help lead this great technology innovator during a critical time of change and disruption. I know you're all very anxious to hear more from me on our long-term plans and I'll be sharing my detailed perspective after I assume my new role mid-February. That said, I do want to provide my view specifically on 7-nanometer progress. I've had the opportunity to personally examine progress on Intel's 7-nanometer technology over the last week. Based on initial reviews, I am pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program. I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally. At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it's likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products. We will provide more details on this and our 2023 roadmap once I fully assess the analysis that has been done and the best path forward. Bob and George will walk you through the financials and provide guidance for the first quarter shortly. We are holding off on providing guidance for the full-year until I join, but we will do so in a timely fashion no later than on our next earnings call in April. Looking ahead, the world is becoming more digitally connected, expanding the market in front of us. Intel is the only semiconductor company in the world that has the depth of intelligent silicon, platform vision, design and manufacturing capabilities, and scale that our customers need to fuel their next-generation innovations. There is enormous opportunity ahead for Intel. But to be able to seize these opportunities, we have to deliver the best products and stay ahead of our customers' needs. We need to become more agile in a very competitive market. We need to execute flawlessly and deliver on our commitments. We need to passionately innovate with boldness and speed. Intel culture and values must be healthy and vibrant assuring our ability to attract and retain the best engineering talent in the world. I look forward to working with the incredibly talented global Intel team and industry partners to continue delivering the best technologies for our customers around the world. I also look forward to engaging with you, our shareholders, in the coming months to hear your perspectives and discuss our vision and strategy for Intel. We will position this company for sustained growth and leadership for our industry, our country and an increasingly digital world. I also want to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to Bob for his leadership and significant contributions to Intel through this critical period. I'm just starting to dive into the business, but already I'm confident that the strong foundation and progress achieved under his leadership put us on the right track to build on Intel's great history and to create value for our customers and shareholders in the years to come. Thanks, again. Bob, over to you. And if I might, C.J., this is Pat, pleasure to join all of the investors on this call today. I just want to affirm, as I said in my formal statements, that I was very pleased to see the great progress on 7-nanometers and the TD team has really done a great job over the last six months. That gives me the confidence, as I said in my formal comments, that the majority will be internally, but we will be increasing the use of our foundry capabilities as well and we'll be more specific on this after I finally dig deeper with the team shortly after joining the company in the middle of next month. But overall, I think we're on a very good path now. Let me just add a couple of points to that. This is Pat again. As we said, we believe the majority will be on our 7-nanometers, but we will be increasing the use of foundry capabilities in that timeframe as well. Overall, it is about building as Bob said, a competitive product that is leadership in the marketplace and that's what our intent is to do and as we broaden the use of our technologies across packaging, software, internal and external, we are confident that we can deliver a leadership product family in the marketplace across all of our major product categories. Additionally, I was also very pleased to see some of the long-term innovations coming out of TD right as we work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as leap ahead and clearly we're not interested in just closing gaps, we're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology and that's our commitment. Also with the IDM model, we believe we have the right combination of being able to deliver supply to meet our customers' requirements by leveraging internal and external capabilities which our competition doesn't have and between all of these capabilities, we believe we are striking the right balance of internal and external to deliver an unquestioned leadership product in the marketplace that meets our customers' requirements for the long-term. Well, thank you very much and a few general comments would be, one is, this is a great company and one that I have just great history with as I said 30 years as part of this company, Grove, Moore, Noyce, these are the people that I grew up right at their feet of learning and to me, it really is a privilege and an honor to come back to this company, as I said, my dream job. Second, this is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry for technology in America and to me it's an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in a technology leadership position. So, I'm excited by that opportunity to do that. It was also very exciting to see the unity of the Board in calling me to the role and with that working closely with the Board and their enthusiasm to bring me into the company as well as the alignment on the look forward strategy that we're laying out and those together. And I say the timing wasn't necessarily, I was enjoying my time at VMware, but the opportunity to come back now, be a part of this great company and Intel has gone through cycles before and clearly, as I was here, economic cycles, we've had periods where we were ahead and periods where we were behind others. Personally, I was very involved in the period where we were very right diminished in the marketplace and late to the multi-core and in that period of time in 2005 through 2009, we turned around the company and unquestionably established the leadership position after a period where many were questioning the ability of the company to be successful yet again. Great companies are able to come back from periods of difficulty in challenge and they come back stronger, better, and more capable than ever and that I believe is the opportunity at Intel and I'm confident that this company has its best days in front of it and I am looking forward to the opportunity to be part of that. Well, I would also say that Bob and the team have been working on this for the last six months diligently. So, even though my investigation was really just a few days, I'm looking at data that's been thoroughly analyzed, trends over the last six months that clearly is bringing them to a point of greater confidence for. I looked at that data, I came to the same decisions that they were. At the same time, we're pausing, right, to say that everything is resolved to give me a little bit more time with the team to understand the roadmap and to dig deeper into those decisions and like we said, we'll be giving more clarity on that in the near future after I've had time to analyze it more carefully. Also, the team has been making adjustments of leadership. Ann has been doing a great job as we moved her into that role. You'll be seeing we're making adjustments in the leadership of our product development teams as well where talent is going to come into the company. We're excited about the roadmap that we're on. You might have seen we just announced a new fellow coming back, one of my absolute favorites when I was here in Glenn Hinton coming back to the company and you'll be seeing other announcements of key leaders coming back in. So, I think the team has been doing a great job getting us to this point. I expect with the leadership, the roadmap, and a few more weeks of analysis, we'll be making very solid decisions that allow us to put the company on a path that is merited to the great foundation that Intel has had in the past. Thank you. And if I might pile on to this one, as Bob had said, Bob and I had struck a partnership when I was in my VMware role and I've been driving the 5G strategy at VMware. So, this is one I'm actually quite intimate with and the opportunity at 5G is it becomes a horizontal versus a vertically-controlled industry is absolutely enormous, but it's even more important than that because 5G is going to represent a platform that is redefining edge computing, it will open up smart cities, smart factories, it will displace Wi-Fi. This is a powerful technology; it will also be deployed in private 5G environments as well. So, not only is Intel establishing a beachhead in a very important market that was never a major source of revenue forward in the past, but it is redefining all aspects of distributed computing in the future. So, this leadership position that is established today is one that we'll be harvesting for the next decade and 5G isn't just faster LTE, it is a new network with increased security, connectivity, bandwidth, better than wired capabilities, and truly will open up markets as we've never seen before. This one is exciting and the leadership position that's already been established here will be harvested for many, many years to come. And I would just add to that this will certainly be a topic that we'll discuss as I go forward with the company. Also that clearly this ability to work more closely with the equipment suppliers, right, the CAD tool suppliers, other technology sources in the industry. We're committed to the IDM model, we're committed to leadership products, but also innovation that fundamentally has us leading the industry on a consistent basis and sometimes that may happen outside of the company, sometimes it will be inside of the company, but we're committed to leading innovation and delivering the best products for our customers in every category that we participate in. Great, thank you, Trey and thanks again to Bob and really is incredible to come back home and have my dream job and thank you, Bob, for being the vehicle to deliver that up to me. Four areas that I touched on briefly in my formal comments that you'll see me focus on as I come into the company. One is great products, right, where we simply will be the leader in every category that we participate. You'll see me dive into details, we'll build out the partnerships with our customers, but we're going to deliver leadership products and have a development machine that consistently does that. Then, execution, obviously, we have to regain the confidence of our customers that our supply chain is the best; that our roadmap is the best; that they can rely on us for their products and their strategies for the future. Innovation, we're going to continue to be a source, a fountain, a continual delivery vehicle for the greatest innovations of the industry. We'll be doing that with the IDM model, 7-nanometers beyond, but continuing to find radical areas to innovate because the world is looking for more digital technology as more and more of every aspect of humanity is coming online and coming to the digital foundation that we uniquely build and deliver. And finally culture, I was trained at the feet of Grove and we will have the Grovian maniac execution, transparent data driven culture and rebuilding that as part of this company. And as we look across these areas, as I said, I'm convinced the best days for this company are in front of us and this is a priority for Intel, a priority for the technology industry and our nation and it is a sovereign duty, responsibility, and opportunity for me to be taking on that role. Thank you all for joining us today."

            "name": "Bob Swan",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and welcome back to Intel. It has been an honor to lead this incredible company and its talented team. It gives me great confidence in Intel's future knowing that I'll be passing the baton to Pat, whose technology expertise, industry knowledge, execution track record, and commitment to our company is indisputable. Over the last two years, we made significant progress on our strategy to transform Intel into a multi-architecture XPU company to move from silicon to solutions and to contemporize our IDM model. I am proud of what we're able to achieve together as an Intel team in a relatively short period of time and echo Omar's words that Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this transition. As demonstrated by the results we announced today, demand for Intel's innovative technologies remains very strong and our investments to capitalize on future growth opportunities are paying off. Our Q4 results significantly exceeded our expectations capping off our fifth consecutive year of record revenue. We generated $20 billion in revenue and $1.52 in EPS, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion and $0.42, respectively. For the full year, we delivered $77.9 billion in revenue, up 8% and $5.30 in EPS, up 9%. The client, data center, memory, and Mobileye businesses each set all-time revenue records. In Q4, we continued to advance our three strategic priorities; improving our execution to strengthen our core business, extending our reach to accelerate growth and redefine our position in the industry, and continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital to create value for our shareholders. Let me briefly discuss some of the highlights. Starting with improving our execution to strengthen our core business, let me start with an update on process technology and our product roadmap. Over the last few years, we've been following the IDM model to ensure we can deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve our IDM advantage, continue to invest in process technology leadership, and generate attractive returns on capital. This evolution includes a disaggregated design strategy, adoption of standard industry processes and common tools, flows, and methods, and deeper engagement with the industry ecosystem. In July, we highlighted a challenge with our 7-nanometer technology and started a process to improve it while evaluating the best approach for our 2023 product lineup. Since that time, we have made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer technology. When 7-nanometer was originally defined, the flow contained a particular sequence of steps that contributed to the defect issue we discussed in July. By re-architecting these steps, we've been able to resolve the defects. As part of this work over the last six months, we also streamlined and simplified our 7-nanometer process architecture to better ensure we'll be able to deliver on our 2023 product roadmap. The inline data we have been collecting and our pipeline of proven yield development projects gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments going forward. At the same time, as Pat mentioned, we will continue to leverage the relationships we've developed over the years with our external foundry partners and believe they can play a larger role in our product roadmap given our disaggregated designs. Once Pat has had a chance to join, he'll further assess our analysis and drive the final manufacturing decision for our 2023 CPU products. Therefore, we'll communicate that decision soon after he takes over, but not today. Turning to products, we've qualified several new products in the fourth quarter and we have an incredibly exciting lineup of CPUs for 2021 and 2022. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we introduced more than 50 processors resulting in more than 500 new designs for laptops and desktops coming to market in 2021. We are also seeing tremendous market response for PCs based on our new 11th Gen Intel Core Tiger Lake Processors. Our PC customers now have more than 150 Tiger Lake based systems in the market, well ahead of expectations. We believe we gained market share as PC CPU units grew an impressive 33% in the quarter. In a market where competitors are seeing supply challenges, this is a powerful example of the incredible value and scale of our factory network as we continue to deliver greater performance and cost efficiencies for our customers. Moving to data center, we are now shipping our first 10-nanometer based Xeon Scalable CPU Ice Lake and will be ramping volume through the first quarter. Customers are going to see significant value in Ice Lake across cloud, network, and edge workloads with excellent performance improvement and innovations such as PCIe Express Gen 4, next generation Intel Optane Persistent Memory and security enhancements such as SGX. As we look ahead, we are excited about the capabilities we are bringing to customers with Alder Lake for mobile and desktop PCs and Sapphire Rapids for the data center. These products take advantage of our Enhanced SuperFin process technology and numerous architectural improvements and both are broadly sampling to customers. We will qualify Alder Lake desktop and notebook for production and begin our volume ramp in the second half of 2021 and we expect production qualification of Sapphire Rapids at the end of 2021. In the expanded market opportunity in front of us, CPUs are critical, but multiple architectures or XPUs will be required to help customers optimize for specific workloads. We had a big XPU leap in the fourth quarter as we entered the discrete graphics market with Intel Iris Xe MAX graphics, Intel's first Xe-based discrete GPU. We are now shipping discrete graphics into thin and light notebooks from Acer, Asus, and Dell and we introduced our first discrete GPU for the data center, which is already delivering great cloud gaming experiences for customers such as Tencent. We also announced the gold release of oneAPI, our cross-industry open standards-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across architectures. Second, we've made strong progress extending our reach to accelerate our growth. Over the past several years, we have been making investments that have positioned us to lead key technology inflections such as AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent autonomous edge. We infuse AI capabilities into everything we make from the cloud to PCs and we see tremendous growth prospects as we build our position in data center training to complement the strength of our Intel Xeon for inference. We made a significant step in AI this quarter when Amazon announced EC2 instances that will leverage up to eight of our Habana Gaudi AI training accelerators and deliver up to 40% better price performance than current GPU-based EC2 instances for machine learning workloads. We've also invested to drive networking workload convergence on Intel silicon. In 2020, we expanded our footprint into the Radio Access Network delivering Xeon SoCs, FPGAs, and custom solutions for 5G base station designs and reaching our goal of 40% share, two years ahead of our original target. Today, we are the leading network silicon provider winning in wireless, enterprise, and cloud networks and delivering $6 billion in revenue this year, up approximately 20% versus 2019. Finally, we have enviable assets to lead the explosive growth of intelligent and autonomous edge computing. Our IOTG and Mobileye businesses have a combined annual revenue of $4 billion. Mobileye delivered a record fourth quarter and had an explosive start to 2021 with a number of exciting CES announcements. Third, we've maintained our discipline in thoughtfully allocating our shareholders' capital. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more than $22 billion and more than doubled EPS. We've driven spending from 36% of revenue to 25% of revenue, while investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, adding more than $1 billion of R&D targeted to higher growth initiatives, and focusing our product portfolio. As a result, we anticipate approximately $12 billion in proceeds from our NAND and McAfee exits over time. At the same time, we've been delivering substantial capital returns to shareholders, including $19.8 billion in 2020 alone through dividends and share buybacks, the latter of which included a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase announced in August. Building on this, today, we announced that we are increasing our annual dividend by $0.07 or 5% from $1.32 to $1.39 per share. Before I pass it to George for more details on our fourth quarter results, I want to reiterate that I couldn't be more proud of the team at Intel and I cherish the time I've spent here. I look forward to watching Pat and the team's continued progress as they build on Intel's purpose to deliver breakthrough technology that enriches the lives of everyone on the planet. I also thank our investors and analysts on the line today for their continued support of Intel and for our valued engagements over the years. Yes, thanks, C.J. Maybe I'll start, and George, you can finish up. First, yes, we've been through an exhaustive effort over the course of the last six months. And as we highlighted, we've made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer process technology and that gives us a lot of comfort that the number one priority that we set in the middle of the year, which was a predictable cadence of leadership products that we would be able to deliver our 2023 roadmap using i7 or for our next-gen technology. So, the progress that the team has made has given us the confidence that we'll continue to leverage the IDM advantage and invest in technology development leadership in the future. At the same time, we also realize that with our disaggregated designs that we launched a few years back, that we have enhanced flexibility to see if when and what technologies or tiles we'll make inside, which will be the majority of our 2023 roadmap, but it gives us the flexibility to look at things outside. And the trade-offs that we make in doing that are one, performance of product in a predictable manner; two, economics; and three, ensuring that we have the capacity and the control of the supply chain, so that we can -- our customers can count on our deliveries. So, over the course in time preserving the IDM advantage while being more and more flexible on our architectures and our designs. Yes. And I would -- I'd put maybe, John, just I think history here as a reasonably good indicator of the commentary that George provided for 2021. And if you go back a year, we said gross margins would be 59% for 2020 and we ended up at 57.5%. So, down 1.5 points. And if you look at the fundamental drivers of that 1.5 points versus what we thought at the beginning of the year,first, we generated $4 billion more revenue than we thought. So, volume was much higher. And then when you look at the makeup of that volume, it was -- in my mind, it was all good things that foreshadow important things for 2021 and beyond. First, the demand for our 10-nanometer products was much -- was higher -- greater than we expected and that was very positive in terms of income, but slight degradation in gross margin. Second, the PC demand that we experienced during the course of the year which relative to where we were at the beginning of the year was off the charts, including what we believe were share gains in the fourth quarter came predominantly with consumer entry and education. So, those two segments tend to be lower margin, but real strong demand and that was the gap that we didn't fill when we were capacity constrained last year. So, I think in terms of the mix of more 10-nanometer, much more PC demand at the lower ends, those were things that drove down less margin percent, but a lot more income than we expected a year ago. And those things as George mentioned going into 2021 are going to be -- you're going to have a much better mix because of the exit of modem and NAND, number one. Number two, 10-nanometer product cost, as George mentioned, is going to get much better during the course of the year. Number three, 14-nanometer is going to be more fully depreciated equipment. Those three things are very positive as we go into the year. At the same time, George flagged two issues, one of those mix dynamics of PC TAM we think is going to be relatively strong, but we do believe it's going to be at the lower-end. Education will be a big part of that demand that has lower margin and we renewed our commitment to 7-nanometer process technology and that, in fact, will have a degradation. So, in so many ways, we generated a lot more income and revenue in 2020 as the adoption of our better -- of our 10-nanometer products and lower end in consumer were very positive impacts for earnings and those trends you'll see as we go in the first quarter and throughout 2021. Yes, I think at the time we said that in effect, given the process challenges we were dealing with the product roadmap, we expected to shift a couple quarters into 2023 and as normal client will likely go first and server will go after that. So, the expectation is in our focus in improving 7-nanometer so that we can hit that predictable cadence of leadership products in 2023, we have dramatically improved our confidence in our ability to hit that product roadmap schedule that we talked about at the time. Thank you. Yes, Vivek, two things and we've talked about this a bit over the last couple of years, but first, our belief on delivering leadership products over time is going to be dependent on a multitude of factors. Process technology is very important, packaging technologies becomes increasingly important in our mind, a multitude of architectures, CPU to XPU or including graphics and AI capabilities, memory, security and last but not least software and you'll remember that we talked about those as the six pillars of technology required to deliver product leadership where process is very important, but it's not the only thing. So, that's kind of the strategy we've been on for the last couple of years. But secondly, we're going to continue to invest in process technology. So, yes, some of the progress we made on 7-nanometers over the last couple of quarters is important for the next generation of process technology. So, as we leverage our six pillars of technology to deliver leadership product, we will also continue to invest in next generation process technology beyond 7-nanometer. Thanks for the question. You gave most of my answer in your inquisition. I mean, first is we've been saying for the last couple of years that we view 5G and network transformation as a significant opportunity for us to expand the role we play as more and more compute moves from the data center to the cloud to the network and those dumb pipes become smarter and smarter pipes. So, this has been a pretty large thrust for us for the last several years. We've made tremendous progress in migrating a custom-oriented environment to general purpose compute and that has been a big source of growth from a $1 billion business probably five or six years ago to $5 billion last year. That came primarily by leveraging the core GPU in the network environment, but a couple of years ago to your question, we expanded the role that we thought we could play as more and more compute happened at the network and that included moving into the radio access space with more -- with general purpose compute, but also custom architectures including FPGAs and ASICs and that allowed us to play a much bigger role in our customers' success and a key emerging technology that we've been focused on for a while. So, I think that maybe one other point that I would make that we've gone -- we targeted about 20% share in that radio access space by 2022 and we hit that 40% share in 2020. So, we're well ahead of where we expected. The role we play at 5G and the network is much bigger. We've developed partnerships along the way in this space including with VMware. So, I can only imagine those partnerships and complementary capabilities will allow us to play a bigger and bigger role as more and more compute moves to the network and to the edge. And then on the specific question about the dynamics and discussion with kind of the U.S. government or maybe just our foundry capabilities, I would just -- we've been talking about this for a couple of years and I think the implications of a couple of years ago, increased trade tariffs, now more increasing trade restrictions. At the time, we saw that as a challenge because China is a large market for us, but also was a big opportunity and the big opportunity were on two fronts. In the event of an increasingly East versus West world, we saw an opportunity for us to play a bigger role in 5G. So, we talked about that and I think as a result of the incremental investments we've made, the team has made tremendous progress on our 5G space. At the same time, we also talked about addressing a growing need in an East versus West world where there are dual supply chains and increased anxiety about having all your technology dependencies more in the East. So, for us what that meant was engaging both with the U.S. government and with commercial players who just were increasingly anxious about their exposures and what we've heard from the U.S. government is one, we need advanced access to advanced microelectronics technology and manufacturing here in the U.S. We need greater industrial manufacturing base here in the U.S. and we need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S. and with those with those three things, and this is both U.S. government and commercial customers, we're the only company that can really check all three boxes. So, along the way, as you know, Matt, we told the U.S. government that we would be in a position to, for the good of the industry, frankly, for the good of the country, for the good of Intel, we would leverage our competencies, our capabilities to provide foundry services to the U.S. government and then been working very closely because foundry services requires scale, how do we make sure that we have the technology that can be both USG needs and commercial players' needs. And that's a dialog that has been back and forth for a while and we think we've played a role both with ourselves and the Semiconductor Industry Association in trying to shape some of the incentives coming out of Washington that in effect do a more effective job in leveling the playing field to invest in foundry services here in the U.S. Well, I'll be a little more generic. I think what I said is that our focus is on how do you deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve IDM advantages, and invest in technology development and along the way as a company be much more open and engaging with the ecosystem to make sure we understand the inherent technologies that are out there and embrace technologies to the extent they might be better than what we have or not as critical in the determination of product performance differentiation. So, that said, what we've characterized is just engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way and broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well. So, that's -- I just think it goes back to how do we take this wonderful business model called IDM where we co-optimize, design, and manufacturing, we make all the money and we control the supply chain, how do we evolve that very powerful business model in an industry and an ecosystem that's made dramatic advancements over the last 10 years where we think we can be more open minded in engaging and leveraging those."

            "content": "Thank you, Trey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you've heard, Intel has been in the midst of a major transformation to strengthen our CPU franchise, while evolving into a multi-architecture XPU company. The business is well-positioned to capitalize on key technology inflections and extend our reach into fast-growing markets. Under Bob's leadership, Intel has made significant progress on this strategy and once again delivered record results in the past year, which Bob and George will detail shortly. But before that, I'd like to share a few words about the CEO transition we announced last week. This decision came after very careful consideration and planning by the Board and in partnership with Bob. Pat Gelsinger will rejoin Intel on February the 15th as our new CEO and a member of our Board. Bob will remain in his role until then and will work with Pat to ensure a seamless transition. On behalf of the entire Intel team and Board of Directors, I'd like to thank Bob for his leadership and significant contributions through this period of transformation for Intel. The company faced challenging issues when Bob took over and he has been a fantastic leader. Bob clarified Intel's growth strategy, reenergized its culture, and made significant progress in improving execution. He leaves Intel in a strong strategic and financial position and we deeply appreciate his ongoing guidance during this transition. Last week, Bob and I introduced Pat to Intel employees around the world who gave him a very warm welcome. We believe this is the right time to make this change and we are confident Pat is the right person to lead Intel forward. In addition to deep technology expertise and unique insights of Intel's technology evolution based on 30 years as a leader here, Pat brings a distinguished record of driving growth and performance and shareholder returns. He lives by our values-based cultural leadership approach and has a hyper focus on talent development and operational execution. In sum, the Board is confident that Pat, together with the rest of the leadership team and our incredible dedicated 110,000 employees around the world, will ensure strong execution of Intel's strategy, build on its record of product leadership, and capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead to create long-term shareholder value. While he does not step into the role for another few weeks, he has kindly agreed to join us today. So, you will get to hear some of his initial observations with more to come after he officially takes over on February the 15th. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat for a few words. Well, let me take that one. First of all, the Board has a succession planning process, which we are looking at and we felt that this was the right time to make the move in partnership with Bob and there was no real government influence or anything like that in this decision. So, this was part of our regular process and we're just delighted to have Pat join us at this time and we're confident he can take this company to the next level as he's been saying and thanks to Bob for what he's done. So, there was no other motive other than the regular succession planning process that the Board does have."

The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob.\nBob Swan: Thanks Trey and thank you all for joining our call. We delivered solid third quarter revenue and profitability despite increasing COVID-driven headwinds affecting significant portions of our business. Led by strong consumer notebook demand and continued cloud growth, we generated $18.3 billion in revenue and delivered $1.11 in EPS. We exceeded our topline expectation by $133 million and our bottom-line expectation by $0.01. I'm incredibly proud of our employees' performance through these challenging conditions. Our team has shown tremendous perseverance and has really come together as one Intel to deliver for our customers. Over the last couple of years, we have been focused on three critical priorities; improving our execution to strengthen our core business, extending our reach to accelerate the growth of the company, and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me discuss our third quarter progress. First, improving our execution to strengthen our core business. This quarter we launched our 11th Gen Intel Core processors with Intel Iris Xe graphics, codename Tiger Lake. This is the world's best processor for thin and light notebooks. In real-world workloads versus competitive products, Tiger Lake delivers up to 2.7 times faster content creation, 20% faster office productivity, and more than 2x faster gaming plus streaming. I'm excited to announce that we now expect 100 Tiger Lake-based designs in the market by the end of this year, double the expectation we provided in April. Tiger Lake is a shining example of the product leadership we can deliver for our customers through our six pillars of technology innovation; breakthrough architectural improvements in CPU, graphics, AI, and software combined with our newest 10-nanometer-based technology, SuperFin, which delivers the largest single inter-node performance improvement in our history. Accompanying the Tiger Lake launch, we also updated our master brand and debuted a new platform brand Evo. Based on 11th Gen Core, Evo designs support the sleekest thin and light form factors with premium connectivity, audio, and video. Each Evo notebook is verified to deliver consistent responsiveness, outstanding real-world battery life, instant wake, and fast charging. We expect our customers to have 40 Evo designs in market by the end of the year. Turning to our data center business, we and our customers are excited about the upcoming launch of our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. We're targeting qualification at the end of Q4 with volume ramp shortly after in Q1. Recently, Oracle announced that they plan to leverage the computing performance of Ice Lake for the next generation of cloud-based high-performance computing instances within Oracle cloud infrastructure. The combination of 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with other improvements in Oracle's new X9 generation instance can drive up to 30% higher performance gains on certain workloads compared with the existing X7 generation instances. CPUs are foundational to our business, but we are also adding a range of other processing engines or XPUs to our portfolio. We've made great strides in graphics and we are now scaling our graphics architecture from integrated to discrete levels of performance. Our first discrete GPU DG1 is shipping now and will be in systems for multiple OEMs later in Q4. We also powered on our next-generation GPU for client DG2. Based on our Xe high-performance gaming architecture, this product will take our discrete graphics capability up the stack into the enthusiast segment. Beyond the CPU and the GPU, our customers tell us that they want a diverse range of AI solutions to fit every power level and performance needs from the intelligent edge to the data center. For the most demanding AI workloads, our customers are looking for purpose-built XPUs that leverage a standard-based programming environment. With that in mind, we acquired Habana Labs almost a year ago. We've integrated Habana with our platform capabilities and added software resources, so that we can deliver game-changing capability to the performance tier of the data center market. Habana's inference card is now in volume production and shipping to customers. And we're also in proof of concepts with several major cloud service providers on Habana's training card. In addition to our architectural advancements and process improvements with SuperFin, we've also advanced our packaging technologies. Several weeks ago the U.S. Department of Defense awarded us the second phase of its state-of-the-art heterogeneous integration prototype program or SHIPP. The SHIPP program enables the U.S. government to access Intel's state-of-the-art semiconductor packaging capabilities in Arizona and Oregon and take advantage of capabilities created by Intel's tens of billions of dollars of annual R&D and manufacturing investments.  Software is another essential pillar for product leadership which is why we have more than 15,000 software engineers working across the stack from BIOS to application optimization. As an example, we have dedicated software experts who optimize key workloads using our hardware capabilities. Through these efforts we have increased the performance of top data center workloads such as the NAMD molecular dynamic simulation code used in the fight against COVID-19 by 1.8 times via AVX512 and natural language processing using the BERT model by 6.8 times via a range of software optimizations. Additionally, we have been working closely with the ecosystem on the open standard oneAPI effort as part of the XPU transformation. With oneAPI we are creating an open unified software architecture that can support the variety of XPUs that our customers demand. We've made tremendous progress with developers and released spec 1.0 of oneAPI in the third quarter and on track to have the gold release of oneAPI software in the fourth quarter this year. Second, we're focused on extending our reach to accelerate our growth. We are actively executing against a diversified growth strategy and now have several multibillion-dollar businesses fueled by data and the rise of artificial intelligence 5G network transformation and the intelligent autonomous edge. We built these businesses by positioning the company to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history, in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer. Our ambitions are much greater. And to realize them we must play a larger role in our customers' success. Here are some recent examples. We created OpenVINO in 2018 so that developers could quickly accelerate applications with deep learning inference and solutions deployed from edge to cloud. In the third quarter our OpenVINO download rate was more than double our peak last year and we've now seen our OpenVINO-related edge design wins scale more than five times in the first half of this year versus the same time last year. And we're only beginning to realize the opportunities created by 5G. As communication service providers evolve their networks to support the rollout of future 5G networks, they are increasingly adopting a software-defined virtualized infrastructure. This quarter, Verizon successfully completed the world's first fully virtualized end-to-end 5G data session, leveraging Intel's vast portfolio of products including Xeon, FPGAs, ethernet cards and Flex-Ran software reference architecture and our years of experience in virtualization. We continue to see excellent customer momentum in our Mobileye business. Year-to-date we now have 29 new design wins for more than 26 million lifetime units. Following last quarter's landmark design win with Ford we announced collaborations with Geelys, AHG and WILLER. Geely Automotive Group the largest privately held auto manufacturer in China unveiled its new electric vehicle featuring Mobileye's SuperVision surround view for hands-free ADAS solution starting in late 2021. We expanded our Mobility-as-a-Service collaborations network with two important partnerships. The first is with Al Habtoor Group from the UAE; second with WILLER Japan to propel the deployment of autonomous vehicles and Mobility-as-a-Service. Mobileye is also first of our IOTG businesses to return to pre-COVID levels as global vehicle production improved in the third quarter. Finally we're always mindful of our role in thoughtfully allocating your capital. This week we signed an agreement to sell SK hynix our NAND memory business for $9 billion. We believe this is a fantastic win-win transaction that allows us to focus our energy and investment in differentiated technologies, where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. At the same time, SK hynix can build on the success of our NAND technology at a greater scale and grow the memory ecosystem to the benefit of our data center customers, partners and employees. We are retaining our Optane technology and intend to continue investing, developing and scaling the Optane business. We've also significantly improved supply for our customers. We've expanded our capacity by more than 25% in 2020 and currently have three high-volume fabs producing 10-nanometer products to meet our customer demands. Earlier this quarter, we also entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase $10 billion in stock. Following this repurchase we will have completed approximately $17.6 billion of the $20 billion repurchase commitment we made in October of 2019. We have a very strong balance sheet. And even as macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we are confident in our long-term strategy and the value we create as we grow our business. Finally, let me share a few thoughts about the guiding principles we use to deliver the most value for our customers. Our overarching and most important priority is to deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products. A few years ago we decided that an architectural shift to die disaggregation enabled by our differentiated advanced packaging would be a potent tool for employing the best technologies that we and the ecosystem can provide. We also realized that delivering on that promise meant engaging the ecosystem in a different way: treating the equipment and EDA providers and third-party foundries not as suppliers but as strategic partners that we can learn from and that can help us solve customer problems. Now we have more flexibility in whether we make or buy or whether we make for others. Many of our future products can no longer be described as manufactured inside or outside or as being a large core or a small core product. These products will take advantage of hybrid architectural approaches and the universe of IP deployed both inside and outside the walls of Intel. That said, we have and do get great benefits from internal manufacturing. We call it our IDM advantage, because it provides us attractive economics, co-optimization of design and process technology development and supply assurance. So as we engage the ecosystem more broadly, we want to preserve some of the advantages of IDM like schedule, performance and supply, as we work with our strategic partners. Finally, I want to reiterate our intention to continue investing in leading process technology development to bring future process nodes and advanced packaging capabilities to market. This is a powerful force in creating future differentiation for our products and provides tremendous option value for our business. As I look to the next several years of products, I am excited about the products we have coming. We are now sampling our 2021 client CPU Alder Lake, and we'll be sampling our 2021 data center CPU, Sapphire Rapids later in the fourth quarter. Both will deliver significant capabilities enabled by our six pillars of innovation including our enhanced SuperFin technology. We have another great lineup of products in 2022 and I'm increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes or a combination of both. I look forward to providing further update in the January call.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Despite intensifying COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in our data center, enterprise and government segment, we exceeded our revenue and EPS guidance, achieved record notebook sales and saw continued growth in our cloud and comm service provider, data center segments. Revenue came in at $18.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year and approximately $100 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue was $8.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year on COVID-related weakness in the DCG, enterprise and government segment in IOTG and NSG. PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year on strong notebook PC demand in consumer and education segments and on increased supply. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, two points below expectations due to lower data center ASPs, driven by mix shift from enterprise and government to cloud and lower PC client ASPs on increased demand for consumer and education PCs. Operating margin was 29%, down one point versus our expectations. Q3 EPS was $1.11 slightly better than our guide, as lower spending and the impact of our accelerated share repurchase more than offset lower client and data center ASPs. In Q3, we generated $8.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.7 billion in CapEx resulting in $4.5 billion of free cash flow. We paid $1.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and initiated an accelerated share repurchase program for an aggregate of $10 billion of common stock. Following settlement of these agreements by the end of 2020, we'll have repurchased a total of approximately $17.6 billion in shares as part of the planned $20 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the $2.4 billion balance and return to historical capital return practices when markets stabilize. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $25.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year; and year-to-date free cash flow is $15.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Let's move to segment performance in Q3. Against the challenging compare Data Center Group revenue of $5.9 billion was down 7% from the prior year. COVID-driven headwinds significantly impacted our enterprise and government segment, which was down 47% year-over-year following two consecutive quarters of more than 30% growth. Our cloud and comm service provider segments were up year-over-year 15% and 4% respectively. DCG adjacencies grew 34% as strong adoption of 5G network solutions continued. Platform units were up 4% and ASPs were down 15% on higher networking SoC volume and weaker enterprise and government volume. Operating margin was 32% down 17 points year-over-year on lower revenue, due to enterprise and government weakness and the ramp of 10-nanometer 5G base station SoCs and pre-PRQ reserves on our Ice Lake server product. Revenue in our other data-centric businesses was down 18% year-over-year, due to declines in our IOTG, NSG and PSG businesses. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 33% and 80% respectively on continued COVID-related demand weakness. Mobileye returned to profitability with revenue up 2% year-over-year and 60% sequentially as global vehicle production improved. NSG revenue was down 11% year-over-year on lower volume, partially offset by higher ASPs. Operating income was $29 million for the quarter, up $528 million year-over-year on improved ASPs and reduced unit costs. PSG revenue was down 19% year-over-year on weaker embedded and communications segment demand, partially offset by cloud segment growth of 43%. Operating income was down 57% on the lower revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 billion up 1% year-over-year driven by strong consumer notebook demand, offset by lower desktop volumes and declines in the modem and home gateway businesses due to divestiture. PC unit volumes were up 11% year-over-year on record notebook volume enabled by significantly increased supply. ASPs were down 6% year-on-year due to increased volume in our consumer entry in education segment. As Bob mentioned Tiger Lake ramp is exceeding expectation with 100 design wins expected by end of year up from 50 forecasted in Q2. As supply increases and we see strong demand for our leadership products including Tiger Lake, we continue to expect to regain share through year-end. Operating margin was 36% down eight points year-on-year on higher unit cost associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Moving now to our fourth quarter outlook, we see many of the same dynamics in Q4 that were in place in Q3. We see continued strength in consumer notebook PCs supported by work and learn-from-home dynamics and from increased supply. We also expect continued strong Mobileye growth as design win momentum continues and the automotive industry stabilizes. We expect continued demand weakness in IOTG and NSG as well as in the enterprise and government segment of DCG. Further, our guide assumes cloud segment demand moderates as key customers enter a digestion period following multiple quarters of above trend line growth. As a result, we expect total revenue of $17.4 billion with PC-centric down low single digits and data-centric down approximately 25% year-over-year. Gross margin is expected to be 55%, down five points year-over-year on the same operating environment we saw in Q3. Relative to our prior guide for Q4, we are expecting OpEx to be down modestly in the quarter and gains from our Intel capital portfolio to be up on the order of $0.08 per share. Q4 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is expected to be 14.5%. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our NAND business to SK Hynix. The sales consideration is $9 billion in two stages. The unique structure of this deal is strictly a factor of existing commitments within our long-term agreements with Micron. At the first close subject to regulatory approvals, we will receive $7 billion and transfer the assets of the factory and the Dalian facility overall. We will continue to operate the factory for SK Hynix until we can transfer the entirety of the business in 2025. We will begin accounting for the NAND business as held for sale effective this quarter for GAAP purposes. Non-GAAP reporting will be unchanged in Q4 and then NAND will be excluded from non-GAAP reporting effective Q1 2021. Under held for sale, depreciation is suspended from the announcement date forward. The benefit of this change will not be seen until existing inventory-carrying depreciation and cost of sales is sold through. So earliest benefit will be later in Q1 2021 or Q2 2021. Capital spending for the NAND business will be shown in assets held for sale and excluded from free cash flow. This will reduce our forecasted capital spend for 2020 by approximately $300 million and raise our free cash flow by a similar amount. We believe this sale is a true win-win as SK Hynix will commit the necessary investment to bring this business to scale and Intel will dispose of a non-strategic asset to focus on our core opportunities ahead. Let's move to the full year. Based on our Q4 guidance, we expect revenue of $75.3 billion and EPS of $4.90, $300 million and $0.05 higher respectively versus our July expectations. We expect our PC business to be up mid-single digits year-over-year against the TAM that is also up mid to high single digits year-over-year. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up mid single-digits year-over-year on strong cloud demand, NSG growth and increased 5G build-outs offset by COVID-related weakness in our IOTG business. Gross margin is expected to be 57% for the year down approximately one point versus July guidance on the mix dynamics we are seeing in both Q3 and Q4 and higher 10-nanometer volumes. Year-over-year gross margin is most heavily impacted by higher volumes of 10-nanometer products partially offset by higher NAND margins on ASPs and lower modem volumes from exit of that business. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.1 billion down approximately $400 million year-over-year. Spending as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 25% of revenue down two points year-on-year due to divestitures and improved operating leverage. The resulting operating margin is approximately 31.5% down 1.5 points year-over-year. Full year EPS of $4.90 is $0.05 above July expectations as higher equity gains, reduced spending and reduced share count are partially offset by lower COVID mix-related gross margins. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion and free cash flow of approximately $18 billion to $18.5 billion. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide as they continue to deliver for our customers in a most challenging environment. And with that I'll hand it back to Bob for some additional thoughts before we go to your questions. Bob? \nBob Swan: Thanks, George. Before we get to your questions just a little context on the year. 2020 has been the most challenging year in my career with a global pandemic geopolitical tensions challenging business principles of globalization and social unrest. Despite all this, we expect to deliver the best year in our storied 52-year history. We plan to grow revenue by $1.8 billion more than our January expectations even as COVID has significantly impacted our business mix. Full year gross margin will be down approximately two points versus our January expectation primarily driven by acceleration of 10-nanometer-based products and a change in mix of products in a work-from-home, study-from-home environment. We've maintained spending discipline even as we invest in our workforce communities and supply chain to combat COVID and the decision we made to sell our NAND business will drive one to two points of non-GAAP gross margin accretion next year. Finally, we are mindful of your capital and made decisions to increase shareholder value through our ASR and increase dividend and prudent management of our Intel capital portfolio. Nine months into 2020, we now expect to beat our January free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $2 billion. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through difficult circumstances to deliver these financial commitments and support our customers.\nTrey Campbell: All right. Thank you Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: Yes. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. George, I guess I wanted to double quick on gross margin. It came in, obviously, below for Q3 and Q4 is about 400 basis points below what it was thought to be. So there's not much of a recovery in Q4. And I certainly understand the weaker enterprise and government and mix, but you were already pretty cautious on those segments and you already paid the price for the pre-quals on the Tiger Lake. So it sounds like that's at least on track. And Q4 revenue is about as you thought it would be three or so months ago if not a bit better. So I guess I'm just trying to understand how mix could account for this much lower gross margin. I guess, the point that investors are going to say is that this is competition and it's the beginning of a slippery slope. So I wonder if you can both talk about that. Thanks.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks Tim. I think in many ways you kind of summarized what took place in the third quarter. And really the fourth quarter is quite similar with a few changes I'll talk about. But for the two-point falloff in the third quarter, it really was a factor of -- it turned out to be a very different quarter than we thought going in, a much heavier mix of the entry-level PC markets both consumer and education. So you saw that in the ASPs even as we saw strong unit demand. In server, enterprise and government after two consecutive quarters of growing 30% dropped 47% year-over-year. And as you know that's -- from an ASP standpoint that's a very healthy market for us. And so if you take that into account and also the fact that we saw growth in our SoCs within the data center that actually pulls down ASPs as they have very different ASPs obviously than the server chips. So overall it was really a mix story. Yes competition -- we're seeing increased competition in the second half of the year, but not different levels of competition than we thought. We feel good about where we are on the year. So I would say it's really a mix story and a very different mix than we thought going in.\nBob Swan: Maybe just\u2026\nGeorge Davis: Go ahead, go ahead.\nBob Swan: \u2026to add I was just going to say that the one other dynamic and we -- this impacted us as we thought about the second half but it's been even more exacerbated now is the demand for our 10-nanometer products. We said that it was going to be -- it was up 20% in the second half from what we thought back in the beginning of the year. And now we're saying it's up north of 30% from what we thought. And that's a function of the Tiger Lake product that we launched in the third quarter, real strong demand, double the design wins that'll be on the shelf during the course of the fourth quarter and the ramping of three high volume manufacturing fabs to enable more and more supply. We're going to get more 10-nanometer product than we even anticipated 90 days ago. So that's just the one added feature that -- on top of George's commentary.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. And I would say in Q4, Tim you'll see more of the benefit of Tiger Lake as the volume there ramps further. So notebook will be a stronger contributor in Q4 than they were in Q3. And then as we said we think cloud digestion starts. So we expect that to fall off and put pressure on gross margins because we don't see E&G coming back. So stronger notebook better flow through and I think it's kind of a rent-and-repeat quarter in terms of the gross margin outlook. But it's a mix story and it's one where we think as mix normalizes that gets healthy -- gross margin gets healthier.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks Tim. Operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Another question on gross margin. So the positive 10-nanometer demand acceleration this year, obviously, good to see but it is having the impact of muting your gross margins. You're still coming off the learning curve. But this should be a tailwind to gross margins in 2021 as more of the volume is going to be on 10, you're getting through the early yield learning and higher cost profile this year. Is that how the team sees it? And if so, should we expect the team to recapture the 200 basis points of gross margin next year that you gave up this year because of the more aggressive 10-nanometer pull-forward?\nGeorge Davis: The way we look at it, we said, as 10-nanometer accelerated because -- as it's displacing 14-nanometer, there's a margin impact from that. So we think, even as we see cost initiatives that are improving the cost structure of 10-nanometer, the teams are working on the yield performance of 10-nanometer all that should show up as positive. The impact of 10-nanometer will still be felt in 2021, as we guided back in May of 2019. So ramping earlier has changed the mix a little bit in 2020 from what we thought. And that has put some pressure on. But 2021 right now, I wouldn't call it a tailwind. We've got other tailwinds, for gross margin in 2021. For instance our IOTG business was really hurt this year. We think that starts to come back and we get margin accretion there. Mobileye has already returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter and as -- we see it accelerating further. We think E&G comes back. We kind of had the reverse of what you normally see in enterprise and government which is weak first half strong second half. And we saw a very strong first half and a weak second half. So we think normalization is good. We think cloud digestion will take some time but we expect cloud to be back acquiring in 2021. So -- and then on top of that, we have the modem exit. So as we sell fewer and fewer modems, that's actually margin accretive. And then of course, we announced the NAND exit which we think gives us about a one- to two-point tailwind on gross margins next year.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: Next question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your question please?\nBlayne Curtis: Hey guys. Thanks for question. Maybe just drilling down on the gross margin. Just looking at the op margin in DCG 32%, I think that's the lowest ever. So maybe if you can just redo that answer, I guess just focusing on gross margins in data center, because that's an area that you haven't yet really ramped 10-nanometer. So I'm just kind of curious how to look at that business as that, layers in. And also you fold Optane in later.\nGeorge Davis: Yes, obviously, what we saw was lower revenue than we expected there with the falloff of E&G. And as you look at the ASP dynamics of that -- of such a steep drop-off a 47% year-over-year drop-off, that certainly has an impact on gross margin which flows right through to operating margin. On operating margin too, we've also added the Habana business into the spending profile. So you've seen some growth in spending as we're investing in the AI area. And then again overall we think as E&G comes back and cloud recovers. We should be seeing strong margin performance out of DCG.\nBob Swan: But as George mentioned earlier, the -- year-on-year you have a 15% ASP decline, but when you look at within the segments of the business cloud growth continued to be really strong. So on a year-to-date basis cloud is up mid-30%. So cloud performance relatively strong. Our comms business real strong volume growth, as the role we play at network and the edge becomes larger. Yet that strong unit volume growth is much lower ASPs than our kind of normal cloud and enterprise business. And then third, with the enterprise decline being so big where the ASPs have a tendency to be higher prices, the combination of that mix effect mix alone of the business drove the lion's share of the 15% ASP decline. So, mix dynamics that George flagged, but with strong cloud growth -- I think the reality of E&G is -- remember we were up 34%, through the first six months of the year. So when you take into account third quarter volume on a year-to-date basis the E&G business is flat in a fairly challenging macro environment. So all told, I think what we saw in the course of the second quarter going into the third quarter inventory levels in the channel were probably relatively high. They bled off quite a bit, in the third quarter. And therefore, year-to-date at being flat it's probably in line with where we were when we started the year, with a stronger first half a weaker second half.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. And another way to look at it Harlan is, we kind of had a year that was -- compared to our normal seasonality, we had our strong second half of the year and the first half very, very big prints on operating margin for DCG year-over-year. And what we're seeing is, as we forecasted a weaker second half and which looks a lot more like what we would normally see in the first half. \nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for the color.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Blayne. Next, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask question. Bob, I appreciate your comments around 7-nanometer and your ability to kind of want to maintain maximum flexibility around your 7-nanometer decisions. But there comes a point in time where your own lead time for capacity or a foundry's need for lead time for capacity forces the decision upon you guys. So I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the window close to when you have to make a decision on 7 and if you could help us understand kind of the scenarios we should be thinking through. Is this as much as an all or nothing? Or are we talking percentages here? And how should we think about that?\nBob Swan: Yes. Thanks, John. I mean, first we have a very strong product lineup for 2020, 2021 and 2022 for client, for server and for IoT. So we feel very good about what our lineup looks like over the next three years. And not just for the CPU, but for the GPU for AI and for FPGA. So the next three years we feel very good about the product lineup. So as we think about 2023 and beyond, we're looking at the products required at that time. And we're evaluating our process versus other third-party processes. And the fundamental criteria, as you could imagine, are at the macro level fairly simple: schedule and schedule predictability, product performance and economics with supply chain -- our ability to control the supply chain best we possibly can. So the criteria are relatively simple and we're evaluating each one of those kind of as we exit 2020 and really early 2021, because that's the time that we'll have to make the determination as to whether we're buying more 7-nanometer equipment or whether a third-party foundry would be adding that capacity. So we're going through this process really looking at our capabilities others' capabilities around those three fundamental criteria. I would say since the last time we spoke, our 7-nanometer process is doing very well. I mean, last time we spoke we had identified an excursion. We had root caused it. We thought we knew the fix. Now, we've deployed the fix and made wonderful progress. But nonetheless, we're still going to evaluate third-party foundry versus our foundry across those three criteria. And the call will be towards the end of this year early next year. On your last question John about, is it an all or nothing. No, I'd say, we look at server or client. We look at big core, small core. We look at some segments of the stack within the product line. So we're looking at a variety of different parameters in terms of the makeup of the business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's probably not an all or nothing; it's probably a mix in terms of the best path to ensure that we had a predictable cadence of leadership products for 2023 and 2024 like we believe we will have in 2020, 2021 and 2022. And we'll learn a lot more as we have in the last 90 days during the course of the next 90 days and I think, be in a pretty good position to lay out our decision in the January time frame.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you. Helpful color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the server road map. And in particular, you've talked about Ice Lake being kind of more volume early part of next year and Sapphire Rapids also next year. It seems like a pretty quick transition to what seems like a pretty important Sapphire Rapids launch. Can you just talk about how that's going to play out with those two being so close together? \nBob Swan: Well, I mean, I think, Joe, it's been a fairly consistent road map over the course of the last 18 months or so with Cascade Lake now Ice Lake end of year, beginning to ramp early next year a very -- in our mind a very attractive and enhanced feature set for Sapphire Rapids at the end of the year, kind of, four quarters later which is kind of the road map that we've laid out for our customers over the course of the last 18 months. And I think people are pretty excited about getting Ice Lake out and equally excited about the enhanced feature set of Sapphire Rapids at the end of the year. So as long as we got it fairly laid out predictable, so our customers can plan effectively, we want to be able to continue to do that cadence of leadership products kind of in sequence in a 4 maybe 5 quarter kind of timeframe. And this is not dramatically different than how we've approached it in the past. \nJoe Moore: Okay. So just to make sure I understand so Sapphire Rapids will be sort of more volume in kind of early 2022? Or is it -- am I trying to cut it too finely there? \nBob Swan: You're doing a little too fine cutting it.\nJoe Moore: Okay. Thank you so much.\nBob Swan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your line is open.\nTristan Gerra: Hi, good afternoon. Under a scenario where TSMC starts building leading node processes for you and I understand you haven't - you still have to reevaluate all of this over the next 90 days, can you explain how easy it is to transition from TSMC back to your internal manufacturing? How comfortable that is? And would that be for existing type of architecture or more like chiplet type of architectures? \nBob Swan: Yes. It's a good question. I mean I gave kind of the criteria around should we under what circumstances go out more of schedule predictability performance and of economics if you will the bookend on that -- on those three criteria really around one, the ease of portability of our technologies to go out. And I would say, we feel very confident in the ability of us being able to port to TSMC. And the other bookend is in the event that we go out what's the ease in which we can port back if we conclude that's the best alternative for either core products or chiplets. I would just say that we feel increasingly confident that yes in fact, if we conclude going out makes sense that we can. And also that in the event we want to port back in, we can as well. And that's -- those are general observations around the bookend questions. And then there's a bit of complexity based on the nature of the product whether it's more big core versus more synthesizable cores. So we can go out we can come back in and we're in the process of evaluating that should we and under what circumstances. \nTristan Gerra: Great. Thank you very much.\nBob Swan: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your question please.\nGeorge Davis: Pierre, please make sure your line unmuted. Using the speaker phone, lift the handset.\nPierre Ferragu: Can you hear me well? \nGeorge Davis: We can now. \nPierre Ferragu: Okay. That's great. So yes, I'd like to go back to the PC market and the comments you've made on market share. So it looks like you're gaining -- regaining market share in the lower end of the market in the notebook market. How are things in the higher end of the market like for the gaming community? How did things play out in Q3? And how do you see them playing out over the next year? \nBob Swan: Yes. So I'll start. George you can pile on. I mean first, we're up 9% unit volume year-to-date 11% unit volume in the third quarter with a TAM that's probably up in the high single digits at this stage. So when we came into the year, we want to number one, increase our capacity which we have in fact done. Number two, launch some very good products; and then number three, with that incremental capacity and improved product roadmap to begin to recapture share. And I would say that we feel -- we don't exactly know how Q3 TAM is going to be, but I think on a year-to-date basis we feel like we've gained back some market share primarily by protecting the higher end and recapturing the small core. And I think those have all been a little bit exacerbated by a market that is much stronger than we anticipated, number one. And then as George flagged this massive mix shift that happened really in the third quarter and we expect to continue in the fourth quarter to more mobile notebook products where we think we've got a wonderful product offering. So in the aggregate we're looking at a TAM in the high -- mid to high single-digit growth for the year. Our volume through nine months is 9%. We got really good ramp of our 10-nanometer product in the holiday and we think we've got a nice supply chain kind of up and down the stack as we go into the holiday season. \nGeorge Davis: Yes. And we said in the first half of the year, we had seen share in the entry markets. We just didn't have the capacity to serve both the higher end PC markets and the entry level. We're seeing -- we expected some mix shift clearly not at the level that we saw in Q3 and Q4. So we're getting the opportunity to recover share in this space. And quite frankly, we could have sold -- if we -- everything we could have produced on top of what we produce we could have sold in Q3 and we're seeing super strong demand coming into Q4 as we're ramping more capacity. So we feel very good about starting to recover and grow that share in the second half that we -- where we were down in the first half in the entry market. \nPierre Ferragu: Thank you.\nGeorge Davis : Thank you, Pierre.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Danely: Hi. Thanks, guys. Actually just a clarification first and then a longer-term question on gross margin. So when you talked about the reasons for the pressure on gross margin as far as mix goes I just want to make sure that there's no I guess aggressive pricing on your part or no pricing pressure from the competition?  And then my longer-term question is, it seems like some of these headwinds on pricing such as mix and more comm revenue are not going away. So do you think longer-term, we should look at your gross margins as maybe being the range being a little bit lower than what you've indicated previously? Or is that going to be offset by the NAND situation? Maybe just a little clarification there. \nGeorge Davis : Sure. Maybe I'll start and Bob may want to throw in some things. So, on the pricing headwinds it's largely mix. Again, we're seeing the competitive environment that we expected to see. It's not to say that there isn't some pricing effect from competition, but the change is really dominated by the mix change. And in terms of long-term implications, I think we're in a very unusual circumstance. So just the dynamics of our year, kind of a 55-45 year and the radically different mix that we saw. And both of those were really responding to COVID related to demand dynamics. So I think I wouldn't draw too many long-term implications of this. I mean there's -- our focus is on having the most competitive profile in each of these segments. And we think we'll see a normalization to mix that probably is more like 2019 than '20 over the long run. \nBob Swan: Yes. And I would just add as we exit the year and I think it was Joe that asked this a little bit earlier. We go into 2021 with just some real tailwinds and some headwinds. But net-net, I think they're reasonably well balanced relative to the longer-term outlook that we gave you back in May 2019. And just to highlight the tailwinds and you mentioned one of them, we made decisions on some of the lower-margin businesses in our portfolio. Obviously this week's announcement on NAND, the decline that we expect to see in modem volume as we go into 2021, we exited home device connected business middle of the year. So the mix of the business is a net tailwind as we enter 2021. Secondly, we've made really good progress on 10-nanometer yields during the course of this year. And the expectation as we mature going into next year on 10-nanometer will in fact -- we expect will in fact improve. And then third, we will still have a significant portion of our volume in 2021 that will be on 14-nanometer and that will have an increasing portion of the equipment fully depreciated. So we have some real tailwinds in -- these are things that we knew of anticipated 6, 12, 18 months ago. So those are all kind of in line. The only real net positive is the decision on NAND. And then we have some headwinds. When we migrate more and more of our volume from 14 to 10 that will work against us as we anticipated as we planned. And the competitive environment from where we are today versus what we had assumed when we laid our longer-term numbers at not dramatically different. So I think the biggest wildcard now is mix. And that obviously surprised us a little bit, because in the second half I should say just the mix of the dynamics of the business that I'd characterize are more COVID-related and what are the implications of that on 2021 and beyond. But I'd say there's probably as much a chance of positive tailwinds as opposed to negative headwinds on that front. So we've got some real tailwinds some headwinds. Net-net, maybe I'd characterize as maybe a little better positioned today than where we were when we laid it out in May of 2019.\nChris Danely: Thanks a lot. That's very helpful.\nTrey Campbell: Bob, maybe just a couple of thoughts, if you want to close the call out.\nBob Swan: Yes. Well, first thanks for joining us. I'd just say through a very challenging market environment, we expect to grow revenue this year by $1.8 billion and free cash flow by $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion above what we laid out back at the beginning of the year. So despite all the inherent challenges, we'll deliver a stronger year and we'll have a better product portfolio as we go into next year. Second, we are relentlessly focused on delivering a predictable cadence of leadership products. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we have a great product lineup through 2022. The fact that we're working really hard on 2023 at this stage I think is a relatively good position to be in. Third, we continue to extend our reach and accelerate our growth by meeting these key technology inflections such as cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and AI. So I think we're positioning more and more of our resources into real strong growth characteristics. And last thing I'd just say is we're incredibly grateful for the dedication and resiliency of Intel employees, the partners that we work with and our collective efforts to continue to retain a health and safe environment while delivering for our customers. So we are collectively inspired by our purpose, which is simply to create world-changing technologies that enrich the lives of every person on Earth. And I can't imagine a time where that purpose could be more important than it has been during the course of this year. So thanks for joining us and we'll talk to you soon.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks, Bob, and thanks everyone for joining the call. With that operator, let's go ahead and close the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Despite intensifying COVID-related demand impacts, particularly in our data center, enterprise and government segment, we exceeded our revenue and EPS guidance, achieved record notebook sales and saw continued growth in our cloud and comm service provider, data center segments. Revenue came in at $18.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year and approximately $100 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue was $8.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year on COVID-related weakness in the DCG, enterprise and government segment in IOTG and NSG. PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year on strong notebook PC demand in consumer and education segments and on increased supply. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, two points below expectations due to lower data center ASPs, driven by mix shift from enterprise and government to cloud and lower PC client ASPs on increased demand for consumer and education PCs. Operating margin was 29%, down one point versus our expectations. Q3 EPS was $1.11 slightly better than our guide, as lower spending and the impact of our accelerated share repurchase more than offset lower client and data center ASPs. In Q3, we generated $8.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.7 billion in CapEx resulting in $4.5 billion of free cash flow. We paid $1.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and initiated an accelerated share repurchase program for an aggregate of $10 billion of common stock. Following settlement of these agreements by the end of 2020, we'll have repurchased a total of approximately $17.6 billion in shares as part of the planned $20 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the $2.4 billion balance and return to historical capital return practices when markets stabilize. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $25.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year; and year-to-date free cash flow is $15.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Let's move to segment performance in Q3. Against the challenging compare Data Center Group revenue of $5.9 billion was down 7% from the prior year. COVID-driven headwinds significantly impacted our enterprise and government segment, which was down 47% year-over-year following two consecutive quarters of more than 30% growth. Our cloud and comm service provider segments were up year-over-year 15% and 4% respectively. DCG adjacencies grew 34% as strong adoption of 5G network solutions continued. Platform units were up 4% and ASPs were down 15% on higher networking SoC volume and weaker enterprise and government volume. Operating margin was 32% down 17 points year-over-year on lower revenue, due to enterprise and government weakness and the ramp of 10-nanometer 5G base station SoCs and pre-PRQ reserves on our Ice Lake server product. Revenue in our other data-centric businesses was down 18% year-over-year, due to declines in our IOTG, NSG and PSG businesses. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 33% and 80% respectively on continued COVID-related demand weakness. Mobileye returned to profitability with revenue up 2% year-over-year and 60% sequentially as global vehicle production improved. NSG revenue was down 11% year-over-year on lower volume, partially offset by higher ASPs. Operating income was $29 million for the quarter, up $528 million year-over-year on improved ASPs and reduced unit costs. PSG revenue was down 19% year-over-year on weaker embedded and communications segment demand, partially offset by cloud segment growth of 43%. Operating income was down 57% on the lower revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 billion up 1% year-over-year driven by strong consumer notebook demand, offset by lower desktop volumes and declines in the modem and home gateway businesses due to divestiture. PC unit volumes were up 11% year-over-year on record notebook volume enabled by significantly increased supply. ASPs were down 6% year-on-year due to increased volume in our consumer entry in education segment. As Bob mentioned Tiger Lake ramp is exceeding expectation with 100 design wins expected by end of year up from 50 forecasted in Q2. As supply increases and we see strong demand for our leadership products including Tiger Lake, we continue to expect to regain share through year-end. Operating margin was 36% down eight points year-on-year on higher unit cost associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Moving now to our fourth quarter outlook, we see many of the same dynamics in Q4 that were in place in Q3. We see continued strength in consumer notebook PCs supported by work and learn-from-home dynamics and from increased supply. We also expect continued strong Mobileye growth as design win momentum continues and the automotive industry stabilizes. We expect continued demand weakness in IOTG and NSG as well as in the enterprise and government segment of DCG. Further, our guide assumes cloud segment demand moderates as key customers enter a digestion period following multiple quarters of above trend line growth. As a result, we expect total revenue of $17.4 billion with PC-centric down low single digits and data-centric down approximately 25% year-over-year. Gross margin is expected to be 55%, down five points year-over-year on the same operating environment we saw in Q3. Relative to our prior guide for Q4, we are expecting OpEx to be down modestly in the quarter and gains from our Intel capital portfolio to be up on the order of $0.08 per share. Q4 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is expected to be 14.5%. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our NAND business to SK Hynix. The sales consideration is $9 billion in two stages. The unique structure of this deal is strictly a factor of existing commitments within our long-term agreements with Micron. At the first close subject to regulatory approvals, we will receive $7 billion and transfer the assets of the factory and the Dalian facility overall. We will continue to operate the factory for SK Hynix until we can transfer the entirety of the business in 2025. We will begin accounting for the NAND business as held for sale effective this quarter for GAAP purposes. Non-GAAP reporting will be unchanged in Q4 and then NAND will be excluded from non-GAAP reporting effective Q1 2021. Under held for sale, depreciation is suspended from the announcement date forward. The benefit of this change will not be seen until existing inventory-carrying depreciation and cost of sales is sold through. So earliest benefit will be later in Q1 2021 or Q2 2021. Capital spending for the NAND business will be shown in assets held for sale and excluded from free cash flow. This will reduce our forecasted capital spend for 2020 by approximately $300 million and raise our free cash flow by a similar amount. We believe this sale is a true win-win as SK Hynix will commit the necessary investment to bring this business to scale and Intel will dispose of a non-strategic asset to focus on our core opportunities ahead. Let's move to the full year. Based on our Q4 guidance, we expect revenue of $75.3 billion and EPS of $4.90, $300 million and $0.05 higher respectively versus our July expectations. We expect our PC business to be up mid-single digits year-over-year against the TAM that is also up mid to high single digits year-over-year. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up mid single-digits year-over-year on strong cloud demand, NSG growth and increased 5G build-outs offset by COVID-related weakness in our IOTG business. Gross margin is expected to be 57% for the year down approximately one point versus July guidance on the mix dynamics we are seeing in both Q3 and Q4 and higher 10-nanometer volumes. Year-over-year gross margin is most heavily impacted by higher volumes of 10-nanometer products partially offset by higher NAND margins on ASPs and lower modem volumes from exit of that business. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.1 billion down approximately $400 million year-over-year. Spending as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 25% of revenue down two points year-on-year due to divestitures and improved operating leverage. The resulting operating margin is approximately 31.5% down 1.5 points year-over-year. Full year EPS of $4.90 is $0.05 above July expectations as higher equity gains, reduced spending and reduced share count are partially offset by lower COVID mix-related gross margins. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion and free cash flow of approximately $18 billion to $18.5 billion. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide as they continue to deliver for our customers in a most challenging environment. And with that I'll hand it back to Bob for some additional thoughts before we go to your questions. Bob? Thanks Tim. I think in many ways you kind of summarized what took place in the third quarter. And really the fourth quarter is quite similar with a few changes I'll talk about. But for the two-point falloff in the third quarter, it really was a factor of -- it turned out to be a very different quarter than we thought going in, a much heavier mix of the entry-level PC markets both consumer and education. So you saw that in the ASPs even as we saw strong unit demand. In server, enterprise and government after two consecutive quarters of growing 30% dropped 47% year-over-year. And as you know that's -- from an ASP standpoint that's a very healthy market for us. And so if you take that into account and also the fact that we saw growth in our SoCs within the data center that actually pulls down ASPs as they have very different ASPs obviously than the server chips. So overall it was really a mix story. Yes competition -- we're seeing increased competition in the second half of the year, but not different levels of competition than we thought. We feel good about where we are on the year. So I would say it's really a mix story and a very different mix than we thought going in. Go ahead, go ahead. Yes. And I would say in Q4, Tim you'll see more of the benefit of Tiger Lake as the volume there ramps further. So notebook will be a stronger contributor in Q4 than they were in Q3. And then as we said we think cloud digestion starts. So we expect that to fall off and put pressure on gross margins because we don't see E&G coming back. So stronger notebook better flow through and I think it's kind of a rent-and-repeat quarter in terms of the gross margin outlook. But it's a mix story and it's one where we think as mix normalizes that gets healthy -- gross margin gets healthier. The way we look at it, we said, as 10-nanometer accelerated because -- as it's displacing 14-nanometer, there's a margin impact from that. So we think, even as we see cost initiatives that are improving the cost structure of 10-nanometer, the teams are working on the yield performance of 10-nanometer all that should show up as positive. The impact of 10-nanometer will still be felt in 2021, as we guided back in May of 2019. So ramping earlier has changed the mix a little bit in 2020 from what we thought. And that has put some pressure on. But 2021 right now, I wouldn't call it a tailwind. We've got other tailwinds, for gross margin in 2021. For instance our IOTG business was really hurt this year. We think that starts to come back and we get margin accretion there. Mobileye has already returned to year-over-year growth in the third quarter and as -- we see it accelerating further. We think E&G comes back. We kind of had the reverse of what you normally see in enterprise and government which is weak first half strong second half. And we saw a very strong first half and a weak second half. So we think normalization is good. We think cloud digestion will take some time but we expect cloud to be back acquiring in 2021. So -- and then on top of that, we have the modem exit. So as we sell fewer and fewer modems, that's actually margin accretive. And then of course, we announced the NAND exit which we think gives us about a one- to two-point tailwind on gross margins next year. Next question, operator? Yes, obviously, what we saw was lower revenue than we expected there with the falloff of E&G. And as you look at the ASP dynamics of that -- of such a steep drop-off a 47% year-over-year drop-off, that certainly has an impact on gross margin which flows right through to operating margin. On operating margin too, we've also added the Habana business into the spending profile. So you've seen some growth in spending as we're investing in the AI area. And then again overall we think as E&G comes back and cloud recovers. We should be seeing strong margin performance out of DCG. Yes. And another way to look at it Harlan is, we kind of had a year that was -- compared to our normal seasonality, we had our strong second half of the year and the first half very, very big prints on operating margin for DCG year-over-year. And what we're seeing is, as we forecasted a weaker second half and which looks a lot more like what we would normally see in the first half. Thanks, Blayne. Next, operator? Pierre, please make sure your line unmuted. Using the speaker phone, lift the handset. We can now. Yes. And we said in the first half of the year, we had seen share in the entry markets. We just didn't have the capacity to serve both the higher end PC markets and the entry level. We're seeing -- we expected some mix shift clearly not at the level that we saw in Q3 and Q4. So we're getting the opportunity to recover share in this space. And quite frankly, we could have sold -- if we -- everything we could have produced on top of what we produce we could have sold in Q3 and we're seeing super strong demand coming into Q4 as we're ramping more capacity. So we feel very good about starting to recover and grow that share in the second half that we -- where we were down in the first half in the entry market. Thank you, Pierre. Sure. Maybe I'll start and Bob may want to throw in some things. So, on the pricing headwinds it's largely mix. Again, we're seeing the competitive environment that we expected to see. It's not to say that there isn't some pricing effect from competition, but the change is really dominated by the mix change. And in terms of long-term implications, I think we're in a very unusual circumstance. So just the dynamics of our year, kind of a 55-45 year and the radically different mix that we saw. And both of those were really responding to COVID related to demand dynamics. So I think I wouldn't draw too many long-term implications of this. I mean there's -- our focus is on having the most competitive profile in each of these segments. And we think we'll see a normalization to mix that probably is more like 2019 than '20 over the long run."

            "name": "Bob Swan",
            "content": "Thanks Trey and thank you all for joining our call. We delivered solid third quarter revenue and profitability despite increasing COVID-driven headwinds affecting significant portions of our business. Led by strong consumer notebook demand and continued cloud growth, we generated $18.3 billion in revenue and delivered $1.11 in EPS. We exceeded our topline expectation by $133 million and our bottom-line expectation by $0.01. I'm incredibly proud of our employees' performance through these challenging conditions. Our team has shown tremendous perseverance and has really come together as one Intel to deliver for our customers. Over the last couple of years, we have been focused on three critical priorities; improving our execution to strengthen our core business, extending our reach to accelerate the growth of the company, and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me discuss our third quarter progress. First, improving our execution to strengthen our core business. This quarter we launched our 11th Gen Intel Core processors with Intel Iris Xe graphics, codename Tiger Lake. This is the world's best processor for thin and light notebooks. In real-world workloads versus competitive products, Tiger Lake delivers up to 2.7 times faster content creation, 20% faster office productivity, and more than 2x faster gaming plus streaming. I'm excited to announce that we now expect 100 Tiger Lake-based designs in the market by the end of this year, double the expectation we provided in April. Tiger Lake is a shining example of the product leadership we can deliver for our customers through our six pillars of technology innovation; breakthrough architectural improvements in CPU, graphics, AI, and software combined with our newest 10-nanometer-based technology, SuperFin, which delivers the largest single inter-node performance improvement in our history. Accompanying the Tiger Lake launch, we also updated our master brand and debuted a new platform brand Evo. Based on 11th Gen Core, Evo designs support the sleekest thin and light form factors with premium connectivity, audio, and video. Each Evo notebook is verified to deliver consistent responsiveness, outstanding real-world battery life, instant wake, and fast charging. We expect our customers to have 40 Evo designs in market by the end of the year. Turning to our data center business, we and our customers are excited about the upcoming launch of our 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. We're targeting qualification at the end of Q4 with volume ramp shortly after in Q1. Recently, Oracle announced that they plan to leverage the computing performance of Ice Lake for the next generation of cloud-based high-performance computing instances within Oracle cloud infrastructure. The combination of 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with other improvements in Oracle's new X9 generation instance can drive up to 30% higher performance gains on certain workloads compared with the existing X7 generation instances. CPUs are foundational to our business, but we are also adding a range of other processing engines or XPUs to our portfolio. We've made great strides in graphics and we are now scaling our graphics architecture from integrated to discrete levels of performance. Our first discrete GPU DG1 is shipping now and will be in systems for multiple OEMs later in Q4. We also powered on our next-generation GPU for client DG2. Based on our Xe high-performance gaming architecture, this product will take our discrete graphics capability up the stack into the enthusiast segment. Beyond the CPU and the GPU, our customers tell us that they want a diverse range of AI solutions to fit every power level and performance needs from the intelligent edge to the data center. For the most demanding AI workloads, our customers are looking for purpose-built XPUs that leverage a standard-based programming environment. With that in mind, we acquired Habana Labs almost a year ago. We've integrated Habana with our platform capabilities and added software resources, so that we can deliver game-changing capability to the performance tier of the data center market. Habana's inference card is now in volume production and shipping to customers. And we're also in proof of concepts with several major cloud service providers on Habana's training card. In addition to our architectural advancements and process improvements with SuperFin, we've also advanced our packaging technologies. Several weeks ago the U.S. Department of Defense awarded us the second phase of its state-of-the-art heterogeneous integration prototype program or SHIPP. The SHIPP program enables the U.S. government to access Intel's state-of-the-art semiconductor packaging capabilities in Arizona and Oregon and take advantage of capabilities created by Intel's tens of billions of dollars of annual R&D and manufacturing investments.  Software is another essential pillar for product leadership which is why we have more than 15,000 software engineers working across the stack from BIOS to application optimization. As an example, we have dedicated software experts who optimize key workloads using our hardware capabilities. Through these efforts we have increased the performance of top data center workloads such as the NAMD molecular dynamic simulation code used in the fight against COVID-19 by 1.8 times via AVX512 and natural language processing using the BERT model by 6.8 times via a range of software optimizations. Additionally, we have been working closely with the ecosystem on the open standard oneAPI effort as part of the XPU transformation. With oneAPI we are creating an open unified software architecture that can support the variety of XPUs that our customers demand. We've made tremendous progress with developers and released spec 1.0 of oneAPI in the third quarter and on track to have the gold release of oneAPI software in the fourth quarter this year. Second, we're focused on extending our reach to accelerate our growth. We are actively executing against a diversified growth strategy and now have several multibillion-dollar businesses fueled by data and the rise of artificial intelligence 5G network transformation and the intelligent autonomous edge. We built these businesses by positioning the company to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history, in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer. Our ambitions are much greater. And to realize them we must play a larger role in our customers' success. Here are some recent examples. We created OpenVINO in 2018 so that developers could quickly accelerate applications with deep learning inference and solutions deployed from edge to cloud. In the third quarter our OpenVINO download rate was more than double our peak last year and we've now seen our OpenVINO-related edge design wins scale more than five times in the first half of this year versus the same time last year. And we're only beginning to realize the opportunities created by 5G. As communication service providers evolve their networks to support the rollout of future 5G networks, they are increasingly adopting a software-defined virtualized infrastructure. This quarter, Verizon successfully completed the world's first fully virtualized end-to-end 5G data session, leveraging Intel's vast portfolio of products including Xeon, FPGAs, ethernet cards and Flex-Ran software reference architecture and our years of experience in virtualization. We continue to see excellent customer momentum in our Mobileye business. Year-to-date we now have 29 new design wins for more than 26 million lifetime units. Following last quarter's landmark design win with Ford we announced collaborations with Geelys, AHG and WILLER. Geely Automotive Group the largest privately held auto manufacturer in China unveiled its new electric vehicle featuring Mobileye's SuperVision surround view for hands-free ADAS solution starting in late 2021. We expanded our Mobility-as-a-Service collaborations network with two important partnerships. The first is with Al Habtoor Group from the UAE; second with WILLER Japan to propel the deployment of autonomous vehicles and Mobility-as-a-Service. Mobileye is also first of our IOTG businesses to return to pre-COVID levels as global vehicle production improved in the third quarter. Finally we're always mindful of our role in thoughtfully allocating your capital. This week we signed an agreement to sell SK hynix our NAND memory business for $9 billion. We believe this is a fantastic win-win transaction that allows us to focus our energy and investment in differentiated technologies, where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. At the same time, SK hynix can build on the success of our NAND technology at a greater scale and grow the memory ecosystem to the benefit of our data center customers, partners and employees. We are retaining our Optane technology and intend to continue investing, developing and scaling the Optane business. We've also significantly improved supply for our customers. We've expanded our capacity by more than 25% in 2020 and currently have three high-volume fabs producing 10-nanometer products to meet our customer demands. Earlier this quarter, we also entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase $10 billion in stock. Following this repurchase we will have completed approximately $17.6 billion of the $20 billion repurchase commitment we made in October of 2019. We have a very strong balance sheet. And even as macroeconomic uncertainty persists, we are confident in our long-term strategy and the value we create as we grow our business. Finally, let me share a few thoughts about the guiding principles we use to deliver the most value for our customers. Our overarching and most important priority is to deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products. A few years ago we decided that an architectural shift to die disaggregation enabled by our differentiated advanced packaging would be a potent tool for employing the best technologies that we and the ecosystem can provide. We also realized that delivering on that promise meant engaging the ecosystem in a different way: treating the equipment and EDA providers and third-party foundries not as suppliers but as strategic partners that we can learn from and that can help us solve customer problems. Now we have more flexibility in whether we make or buy or whether we make for others. Many of our future products can no longer be described as manufactured inside or outside or as being a large core or a small core product. These products will take advantage of hybrid architectural approaches and the universe of IP deployed both inside and outside the walls of Intel. That said, we have and do get great benefits from internal manufacturing. We call it our IDM advantage, because it provides us attractive economics, co-optimization of design and process technology development and supply assurance. So as we engage the ecosystem more broadly, we want to preserve some of the advantages of IDM like schedule, performance and supply, as we work with our strategic partners. Finally, I want to reiterate our intention to continue investing in leading process technology development to bring future process nodes and advanced packaging capabilities to market. This is a powerful force in creating future differentiation for our products and provides tremendous option value for our business. As I look to the next several years of products, I am excited about the products we have coming. We are now sampling our 2021 client CPU Alder Lake, and we'll be sampling our 2021 data center CPU, Sapphire Rapids later in the fourth quarter. Both will deliver significant capabilities enabled by our six pillars of innovation including our enhanced SuperFin technology. We have another great lineup of products in 2022 and I'm increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes or a combination of both. I look forward to providing further update in the January call. Thanks, George. Before we get to your questions just a little context on the year. 2020 has been the most challenging year in my career with a global pandemic geopolitical tensions challenging business principles of globalization and social unrest. Despite all this, we expect to deliver the best year in our storied 52-year history. We plan to grow revenue by $1.8 billion more than our January expectations even as COVID has significantly impacted our business mix. Full year gross margin will be down approximately two points versus our January expectation primarily driven by acceleration of 10-nanometer-based products and a change in mix of products in a work-from-home, study-from-home environment. We've maintained spending discipline even as we invest in our workforce communities and supply chain to combat COVID and the decision we made to sell our NAND business will drive one to two points of non-GAAP gross margin accretion next year. Finally, we are mindful of your capital and made decisions to increase shareholder value through our ASR and increase dividend and prudent management of our Intel capital portfolio. Nine months into 2020, we now expect to beat our January free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $2 billion. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through difficult circumstances to deliver these financial commitments and support our customers. Maybe just... ...to add I was just going to say that the one other dynamic and we -- this impacted us as we thought about the second half but it's been even more exacerbated now is the demand for our 10-nanometer products. We said that it was going to be -- it was up 20% in the second half from what we thought back in the beginning of the year. And now we're saying it's up north of 30% from what we thought. And that's a function of the Tiger Lake product that we launched in the third quarter, real strong demand, double the design wins that'll be on the shelf during the course of the fourth quarter and the ramping of three high volume manufacturing fabs to enable more and more supply. We're going to get more 10-nanometer product than we even anticipated 90 days ago. So that's just the one added feature that -- on top of George's commentary. But as George mentioned earlier, the -- year-on-year you have a 15% ASP decline, but when you look at within the segments of the business cloud growth continued to be really strong. So on a year-to-date basis cloud is up mid-30%. So cloud performance relatively strong. Our comms business real strong volume growth, as the role we play at network and the edge becomes larger. Yet that strong unit volume growth is much lower ASPs than our kind of normal cloud and enterprise business. And then third, with the enterprise decline being so big where the ASPs have a tendency to be higher prices, the combination of that mix effect mix alone of the business drove the lion's share of the 15% ASP decline. So, mix dynamics that George flagged, but with strong cloud growth -- I think the reality of E&G is -- remember we were up 34%, through the first six months of the year. So when you take into account third quarter volume on a year-to-date basis the E&G business is flat in a fairly challenging macro environment. So all told, I think what we saw in the course of the second quarter going into the third quarter inventory levels in the channel were probably relatively high. They bled off quite a bit, in the third quarter. And therefore, year-to-date at being flat it's probably in line with where we were when we started the year, with a stronger first half a weaker second half. Yes. Thanks, John. I mean, first we have a very strong product lineup for 2020, 2021 and 2022 for client, for server and for IoT. So we feel very good about what our lineup looks like over the next three years. And not just for the CPU, but for the GPU for AI and for FPGA. So the next three years we feel very good about the product lineup. So as we think about 2023 and beyond, we're looking at the products required at that time. And we're evaluating our process versus other third-party processes. And the fundamental criteria, as you could imagine, are at the macro level fairly simple: schedule and schedule predictability, product performance and economics with supply chain -- our ability to control the supply chain best we possibly can. So the criteria are relatively simple and we're evaluating each one of those kind of as we exit 2020 and really early 2021, because that's the time that we'll have to make the determination as to whether we're buying more 7-nanometer equipment or whether a third-party foundry would be adding that capacity. So we're going through this process really looking at our capabilities others' capabilities around those three fundamental criteria. I would say since the last time we spoke, our 7-nanometer process is doing very well. I mean, last time we spoke we had identified an excursion. We had root caused it. We thought we knew the fix. Now, we've deployed the fix and made wonderful progress. But nonetheless, we're still going to evaluate third-party foundry versus our foundry across those three criteria. And the call will be towards the end of this year early next year. On your last question John about, is it an all or nothing. No, I'd say, we look at server or client. We look at big core, small core. We look at some segments of the stack within the product line. So we're looking at a variety of different parameters in terms of the makeup of the business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's probably not an all or nothing; it's probably a mix in terms of the best path to ensure that we had a predictable cadence of leadership products for 2023 and 2024 like we believe we will have in 2020, 2021 and 2022. And we'll learn a lot more as we have in the last 90 days during the course of the next 90 days and I think, be in a pretty good position to lay out our decision in the January time frame. Well, I mean, I think, Joe, it's been a fairly consistent road map over the course of the last 18 months or so with Cascade Lake now Ice Lake end of year, beginning to ramp early next year a very -- in our mind a very attractive and enhanced feature set for Sapphire Rapids at the end of the year, kind of, four quarters later which is kind of the road map that we've laid out for our customers over the course of the last 18 months. And I think people are pretty excited about getting Ice Lake out and equally excited about the enhanced feature set of Sapphire Rapids at the end of the year. So as long as we got it fairly laid out predictable, so our customers can plan effectively, we want to be able to continue to do that cadence of leadership products kind of in sequence in a 4 maybe 5 quarter kind of timeframe. And this is not dramatically different than how we've approached it in the past. You're doing a little too fine cutting it. Thanks a lot. Yes. It's a good question. I mean I gave kind of the criteria around should we under what circumstances go out more of schedule predictability performance and of economics if you will the bookend on that -- on those three criteria really around one, the ease of portability of our technologies to go out. And I would say, we feel very confident in the ability of us being able to port to TSMC. And the other bookend is in the event that we go out what's the ease in which we can port back if we conclude that's the best alternative for either core products or chiplets. I would just say that we feel increasingly confident that yes in fact, if we conclude going out makes sense that we can. And also that in the event we want to port back in, we can as well. And that's -- those are general observations around the bookend questions. And then there's a bit of complexity based on the nature of the product whether it's more big core versus more synthesizable cores. So we can go out we can come back in and we're in the process of evaluating that should we and under what circumstances. Thanks. Yes. So I'll start. George you can pile on. I mean first, we're up 9% unit volume year-to-date 11% unit volume in the third quarter with a TAM that's probably up in the high single digits at this stage. So when we came into the year, we want to number one, increase our capacity which we have in fact done. Number two, launch some very good products; and then number three, with that incremental capacity and improved product roadmap to begin to recapture share. And I would say that we feel -- we don't exactly know how Q3 TAM is going to be, but I think on a year-to-date basis we feel like we've gained back some market share primarily by protecting the higher end and recapturing the small core. And I think those have all been a little bit exacerbated by a market that is much stronger than we anticipated, number one. And then as George flagged this massive mix shift that happened really in the third quarter and we expect to continue in the fourth quarter to more mobile notebook products where we think we've got a wonderful product offering. So in the aggregate we're looking at a TAM in the high -- mid to high single-digit growth for the year. Our volume through nine months is 9%. We got really good ramp of our 10-nanometer product in the holiday and we think we've got a nice supply chain kind of up and down the stack as we go into the holiday season. Yes. And I would just add as we exit the year and I think it was Joe that asked this a little bit earlier. We go into 2021 with just some real tailwinds and some headwinds. But net-net, I think they're reasonably well balanced relative to the longer-term outlook that we gave you back in May 2019. And just to highlight the tailwinds and you mentioned one of them, we made decisions on some of the lower-margin businesses in our portfolio. Obviously this week's announcement on NAND, the decline that we expect to see in modem volume as we go into 2021, we exited home device connected business middle of the year. So the mix of the business is a net tailwind as we enter 2021. Secondly, we've made really good progress on 10-nanometer yields during the course of this year. And the expectation as we mature going into next year on 10-nanometer will in fact -- we expect will in fact improve. And then third, we will still have a significant portion of our volume in 2021 that will be on 14-nanometer and that will have an increasing portion of the equipment fully depreciated. So we have some real tailwinds in -- these are things that we knew of anticipated 6, 12, 18 months ago. So those are all kind of in line. The only real net positive is the decision on NAND. And then we have some headwinds. When we migrate more and more of our volume from 14 to 10 that will work against us as we anticipated as we planned. And the competitive environment from where we are today versus what we had assumed when we laid our longer-term numbers at not dramatically different. So I think the biggest wildcard now is mix. And that obviously surprised us a little bit, because in the second half I should say just the mix of the dynamics of the business that I'd characterize are more COVID-related and what are the implications of that on 2021 and beyond. But I'd say there's probably as much a chance of positive tailwinds as opposed to negative headwinds on that front. So we've got some real tailwinds some headwinds. Net-net, maybe I'd characterize as maybe a little better positioned today than where we were when we laid it out in May of 2019. Yes. Well, first thanks for joining us. I'd just say through a very challenging market environment, we expect to grow revenue this year by $1.8 billion and free cash flow by $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion above what we laid out back at the beginning of the year. So despite all the inherent challenges, we'll deliver a stronger year and we'll have a better product portfolio as we go into next year. Second, we are relentlessly focused on delivering a predictable cadence of leadership products. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we have a great product lineup through 2022. The fact that we're working really hard on 2023 at this stage I think is a relatively good position to be in. Third, we continue to extend our reach and accelerate our growth by meeting these key technology inflections such as cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and AI. So I think we're positioning more and more of our resources into real strong growth characteristics. And last thing I'd just say is we're incredibly grateful for the dedication and resiliency of Intel employees, the partners that we work with and our collective efforts to continue to retain a health and safe environment while delivering for our customers. So we are collectively inspired by our purpose, which is simply to create world-changing technologies that enrich the lives of every person on Earth. And I can't imagine a time where that purpose could be more important than it has been during the course of this year. So thanks for joining us and we'll talk to you soon."

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Mr. Trey Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nTrey Campbell: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Intel\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you\u2019ve not received both documents, they\u2019re available on our Investors website intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we\u2019ll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder, that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob.\nBob Swan: Thanks, Trey. And thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected, and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue, and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom-line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the Company\u2019s revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%. I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate. On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against three key priorities: Accelerating the growth of the Company; improving our execution; and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each. We\u2019re transforming the Company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but positioning our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We\u2019ve built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU; it\u2019s more and more Intel silicon, inside more and more computers, so we can have a larger impact on our customers\u2019 success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today\u2019s results. I\u2019ll highlight a few examples from the past 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI, with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test the latest Intel-optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16, and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge. In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services. Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory-optimized Azure Virtual Machines. We were also excited to be a part of an industry first with Rakuten\u2019s full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world\u2019s first end-to-end fully virtualized cloud-native mobile network and it\u2019s powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core. Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and mobility-as-a-service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading mobility-as-a-service solution company. Combining Mobileye\u2019s market-leading ADAS and AV technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we were excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design wins to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units. We\u2019re also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced three new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S and H series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world\u2019s fastest gaming processors, and our new 10th Gen Intel Core vPro processors delivered uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel Hybrid Technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability. We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role-modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during this crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply, while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first six months of the year. We\u2019re on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year. Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer -based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intranode improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake. Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and will be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021, led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of 2021. Let me provide some updates on our technology roadmap. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture. This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered on a petaflop-scale GPU with high bandwidth memory using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge or EMIB 2D packaging technology. Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate six-month shift in our 7-nanometer -based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We\u2019ve root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We\u2019re mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology roadmap. Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be in our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of 2023. Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the six technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all six technology pillars, process; packaging; architecture; memory; interconnect; and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day. Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting non-core assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the Company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion mobility-as-a-service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India. Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth has never been more essential. But the global problems we face are bigger than any one company can solve alone. That\u2019s why we established 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which call for a collective response to revolutionize health and safety, make technology fully inclusive and help address climate change. We\u2019ve also committed more than $50 million and extended our expertise, global reach and influence to combat COVID-19 as well as social injustice. The early results of our Pandemic Response Technology Initiative, which we announced earlier this week, underscore Intel\u2019s unique ability to partner and collectively solve critical problems. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this challenging time to deliver our purpose and support our customers.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. The atypical seasonal effects of COVID-related demand for mobility products and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 revenue for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 20% year-on-year and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 52% of our total revenue, an-all time high. Strong demand for NAND and 5G networking solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our expectations. Q2 PC-centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales, enabled through increase manufacturing supply on capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive relative to the Company average and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R&D related to 7-nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product. This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the zero dollar units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this quarter. Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, $0.13 above our guide as stronger than expected operating results from notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item. In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow, and invested $3.4 billion in CapEx with $7.7 billion of free cash flow, up 92% year-over-year. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance of our $20 billion share repurchase program and return to our historical capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize. Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer segments. Year-over-year platform volumes in ASPs were up 29% and 5% respectively. DCG adjacencies also delivered significant growth with revenue up 118% year-on-year on strong adoption of 5G networking solutions. While year-over-year comparisons for DCG benefited from a weaker Q2 \u201819, revenue in the quarter came in at the second highest level ever for DCG and the highest revenue ever in our cloud business. Revenue year-over-year was up 47% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government, and 44% for communications service providers. Operating margin was 44%, up 8% year-on-year on higher revenue and high-end compute mix. We see increased competition this year but we\u2019ve also seen strong customer response to our product portfolio and now expect to end the year with market share that is somewhat higher than our original expectations. Our other data-centric businesses were up 14% year-over-year, primarily on the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting demand in our more GDP sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76% respectively, primarily on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye revenue was down 27% and operating income turned to a modest loss as the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches. NSG\u2019s record quarterly revenue of approximately $1.7 billion was up 76% year-on-year on strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing. Q2 was an all time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 million in operating income. PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on cloud strength, which was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and communications segments. Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit costs. CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year-over-year, driven by notebook demand and higher modem and Wi-Fi sales, which more than offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we begin to recover unit share in notebooks utilizing our smaller Core products, which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for our large Core products. Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year-on-year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products and the pre-PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more than offset the benefits of higher revenue. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3. But we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.2 billion with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year. In Q3, we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory draw-down softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year-over-year as accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products and lower platform revenue more than offset NAND margin improvement. We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily due to a lower FDII [ph] benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D tax credits in California, and the effect of a push-out of a foreign grant. The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.03 versus our prior rate expectation. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to full year. We\u2019re providing full year guidance although visibility remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some part or the Company\u2019s first half outperformance will be additive to our estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting revenue of $75 billion and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single-digits year-over-year. Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower modem revenue in the second half. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up approximately 10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G buildouts. After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We\u2019re also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into the second half. We expect continued global GDP-related impacts to our IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the second half of the year. Overall, our implied first half, second half revenue contribution is an anomalous 53% to 47%, as opposed to a more typical year with underserved seasonal buying patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to be 58% for the year, down 1 point versus our reasonable expectations for the year and 2 points lower year-over-year. This change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher than expected demand for our 10-nanometer products, and the push out of a government grant for our memory business. These effects coupled with softness in our IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix in DCG, and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales related to the product timing delays Bob discussed earlier. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% of revenue, down one point year-on-year. Full year spending is up versus our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the previously discussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales, and costs related to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and other portfolio actions, as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The resulting operating margin is 32%, down 1 point, year-over-year. The tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items and the lower FDII benefit. Full year EPS of $4.85 is $0.15 below our January expectations as increased server and notebook PC demand, and slightly higher equity gains are more than offset by COVID-related impacts to IOTG and Mobileye, higher product costs from accelerating 10-nanometer, a higher tax rate and the impact of improving our liquidity by raising additional debt and temporarily pausing our share buyback. The combination of our liquidity actions and the higher tax rate alone impact full year EPS by more than $0.15. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $15 billion and free cash flow of approximately $17.5 billion. To conclude, I\u2019d like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide. Very much appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors who delivered excellent results in the face of a very difficult environment. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Trey and we\u2019ll get to your questions.\nTrey Campbell: All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the competitive and the financial implications of the 7-nanometer delays that Bob you mentioned. So, on the competitive side, by the time you come up with 7, TSMC is planning to be on the 3-nanometer, so will still be a generation ahead. So, what\u2019s the market share implication of that? And then, related on the financial side, what\u2019s the CapEx and gross margin implications, and even pricing implications if you stay on 10-nanometer longer next year? And I guess, the bigger question that a lot of investors would have is, at what point Intel should just consider outsourcing a lot more to foundries, so that you can keep in line with the state-of-the-art and manufacturing technologies? \nBob Swan: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I mean, first, our primary focus is on ensuring that we\u2019re delivering leadership, an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner. So, what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10-nanometer, much like what we\u2019re able to do on 14-nanometer is to get another node of performance within that -- within 10-nanometer in and of itself. So, we feel very good about our product roadmap through 2022. That being said, as we think about that next generation of products in late \u201822 and \u201823 and beyond, we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. And our priority in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But, the focus will be leadership products. So, to the extent that we need to use somebody else\u2019s process technology and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that. And if we do, there\u2019s lots of moving parts. But, the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody else\u2019s foundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our costs, continue to deliver leadership products, so we capture attractive ASPs, and reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry on an older node, or on a last gen kind of process node. So, in the aggregate, for the last couple of years with the real focus on product leadership, we\u2019ve been engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way. We\u2019ve been designing our products and advancing our packaging technologies, so that we have much more flexibility to decide if when we will use our fabs or somebody else\u2019s to deliver that annual cadence for leadership products. We feel very good through \u201822 timeframe. And now, we\u2019re evaluating the optionality that we have on \u201823 and beyond.\nGeorge Davis: Hey, Vivek. Let me just comment on your question around what we\u2019re going to see -- what we might see next year? Next year is still going to be, as it was, when we talked about last in May \u201819 is still going to be largely a 10-nanometer with some 14-nanometer year. And the dynamics there are, as we\u2019re coming into it with having moved a little bit further along the yield curve, as we\u2019ve seen more demand for 10-nanometer products in 2020 than we had expected. So, we\u2019re not going to update \u201821 at this time. But, I think, we\u2019re more concerned about what the global economy is doing than where we are on 10-nanometer.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, a follow-up question on the 7-nanometer delay. I guess, curious, how should we think about the implications for CapEx and required capacity adds at 10-nanometer and 14-nanometer? And then, just to circle back on the comment around contingency plans after \u201822. Considering your first data center CPU will launch in first half \u201823, are you suggesting that that could be found out and not be built internally at Intel? Thank you.\nBob Swan: I think, the first part of your question, with 2022 be in -- in essence say, it\u2019s full array of 10-nanometer product, the expectation is, all else equal, little more 10-nanometer spend and less 7-nanometers spend, provided we decide to continue to do all of our production inside. In the event we decide that we\u2019re going to leverage third-party foundries more effectively, we would add a little more 10 and a lot less 7. And that\u2019s kind of the optionality that we\u2019ve try to build in as we evaluate the future of Moore\u2019s law. And that\u2019s in technology development leadership. In the event we\u2019re not there and there\u2019s a better alternative, be prepared to take advantage of it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Sticking on the same topic of 7-nanometer. Bob, if you could just help me understand yields are 12 months behind where you would expect them but the product ramp is only 6. If you could square that circle that\u2019d be helpful. But more importantly, you had multiple sort of push-outs of 10-nanometer. You\u2019re identifying this 7-nanometer push-out today. What confidence level do you have that this is sort of a one and done issue and it doesn\u2019t turn in to a repeat of 10 where you kind of had multiple periods of push-outs?\nBob Swan: Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly two quarters while process we expect now to be roughly four quarters. The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things. One, a buffer and our planning process between process and product to make sure that we don\u2019t -- minimal disruption on customers, because of process. Second, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside, and therefore further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage. So, that\u2019s why, we\u2019ve been able to be confident in a six-month products slip, even though process was moving out 12 months. In terms of -- I think your second question was about, we\u2019ve seen this movie before, maybe. And I think, the important of our many lessons coming out of 10-nanometer. One of them was how do we ensure that we have contingency plans, in the event that our advancements in process technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership products for our customers on that annual cadence? So, I\u2019m sure things won\u2019t play out exactly the way we want. We think we\u2019ve dialed in a 7. But, at the same time, what\u2019s different is we\u2019re going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match, inside and outside or go outside in its entirety, if we need to. And that\u2019s kind of one of our learnings coming out of 10 is in the event process doesn\u2019t move along as we expect, let\u2019s make absolutely sure with advanced contingency planning, and real milestones that we can switch the best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in light of process complexities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. I\u2019m going to stick with the theme and ask about the 7-nanometer as well. I guess, Bob, it\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re being -- you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to be more pragmatic about internal versus external. But, it seems like contingency plan three years down the road is how the external option is being treated. I think investors are frustrated with how long this execution on manufacturing has happened. Are there steps where instead of being a contingency plan, you actually start making the external side the primary source before 2023? Obviously on the design side, more than the revenue side. And maybe a follow-up, if three to five years down the road, the 20-80, 20 external, 80 internal mix, do you think that changes?\nBob Swan: Maybe, I\u2019ll flip those around. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically, when do we use third-party foundries, rather than do everything ourselves. And we call that engaging in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a variety of different reasons, so we don\u2019t have to build everything ourselves as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So, in general, I would say for planning purposes, we\u2019ve been engaging with the ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 28% to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business. Your first question in terms of planning then, we feel like we have a real solid product roadmap, again for the second half of this year for \u201821 and for \u201822 and that we\u2019ll do it on our existing 10-nanometer that\u2019s ramping fast than we expected, it yields in line with what we expected. So, for the near-term, we think we got a great lineup of products and we expect to fight and protect our share, while standing the role we play in a variety of different places in the industry. But, now is when we\u2019re planning for \u201820, \u201823. And we are evaluating now in light of where we are, where we think the industries, the competition or third parties are, evaluating now what\u2019s the best option for us to make sure that we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. And those decisions are not decisions that we\u2019ll make in 2023. Those decisions, based on the information that we have along the way, will be made long before then. Whether it\u2019s decisions that are about how much capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage more effectively somebody else\u2019s process capabilities and factories, so that we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there is higher demand, or because you\u2019re trying to offset the 7-nanometer delay? Because it\u2019s hitting the margins big time, which doesn\u2019t really tie in my head to like yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January. So, how do we think about the drivers of that 7-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7 -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7-nanometer delay, given what\u2019s going on with margins?\nGeorge Davis: Hey Stacy, this is George. Maybe I\u2019ll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year. So, this clearly -- it\u2019s having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we\u2019re growing faster than we expected in 2020 and where part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and I would say on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we have forecast for the year. So, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It\u2019s a positive growth story in that. Again, we\u2019re seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer product\u2026 \nStacy Rasgon: Wait a minute. If I look at your annual guidance now versus [Technical Difficulty] higher, but it\u2019s actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied when you first gave the annual guidance six months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were, given you\u2019ve actually lowered the second half?\nGeorge Davis: It\u2019s the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue space.\nBob Swan: Well, I think I\u2019ll start with our full year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue.\nStacy Rasgon: Yes. But you just\u2026\nBob Swan: Let me just finish this. I think it\u2019s a good question that maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So, full year demand to the Company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer, we\u2019ve kind of said are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months. And we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, both because customers are demanding it more, the implications are that our margins all else equal, will be lower. And George kind of highlighted those are the primary drivers of a 1 point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster and our 5G comms business in the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put that -- I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category. We feel -- we know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think it\u2019s a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield if it\u2019s more of our growth than we had anticipated. All else equal margins will be a little bit lower. And that\u2019s kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we\u2019re ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume all else equal will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask also on the same manufacturing topic. So, I think, Bob, when you were talking about Ponte Vecchio, I think you said that you\u2019re going to package it internally, but it seemed like you were implying an external foundry contingency, even for this first GPU product. I guess, my question is, did I read that right? And also, I wanted to ask George, what the long-term implications are, if you move to somebody else\u2019s fab? What does this do to your 57% to 63% long-term gross margin? And how does it impact free cash flow? I mean, obviously, it saves you on CapEx but can it be accretive to free cash flow?\nBob Swan: Yes. On Ponte Vecchio, originally the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes an IO based die, connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of package together. That\u2019s kind of the design of Ponte Vecchio. From the beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles outside, and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of how do we mix and match different designs into one package. So, that was the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff inside some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio is really -- Ponte Vecchio on the data center side and Lakefield on the client side, were kind of our test products, both -- one of which we\u2019ve launched, the other one which is in development. So, that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility. As we go forward now, we can think about whether we introduce Ponte Vecchio with -- I think, I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from the beginning. Now, as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out one of our tiles for a third-party foundry or not. Again, that\u2019s the beauty and value of this change and design methodology that gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So, in the event, there\u2019s a process slip, we can buy something rather than make it all ourselves.\nGeorge Davis: And with respect to the long-term outlook, first off, our long-term margin outlook is not 57%, we\u2019ve talked about it being well above that over time. But in terms of as we dynamically move, potentially move product depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more flexibility to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So, we talked a little bit about that actually back in May of \u201819 that embracing the ecosystem and balancing some of our activity externally is going to be important as we look to improving returns over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nWeston Twigg: I wanted to ask about the data-centric revenue heading into Q3. The mid-single-digit decline year-over-year implies a pretty big decline from Q2. You helped a little bit on the call, but I\u2019m wondering if you could help us better understand the reason for that big quarterly drop. And kind of as an aside, you also mentioned increased competition in DCG in the second half, and I\u2019m just wondering what exactly you were referring to on that side?\nGeorge Davis: As you look at the data-centric revenue, we\u2019ll see a number of factors that play. Obviously, year-over-year you\u2019re going to see the impact of the fall of in IoT and in Mobileye. But what we\u2019re seeing in the data -- or the DCG side is, we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all time record, so not a bad peak. We\u2019ve probably peaked back in Q4 of \u201819 on enterprise and government. And while it was reasonably strong in Q1, it\u2019s -- you can see it coming down over the next few quarters. It may have -- it often has a little bit of a bounce in Q4, we\u2019ll have to see. And our comms provider, I would say, we expect Q2 to have been a peak there. And it\u2019ll start rolling off from there. So, everything on the DCG side is got a step down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and comms as our current outlook. Does that help?\nWeston Twigg: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then, the comment on increased competition in DCG in second half?\nGeorge Davis: Yes. We expected, based on the competition\u2019s product roadmap that we would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also thought -- we\u2019ve been a little bit pleasantly surprised in the strength of the demand for our products in the first half of the year and it\u2019s continuing into the second half. So, we don\u2019t think the impact will be quite as large competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on PC, we think we\u2019re going to actually gain share.\nBob Swan: When we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made that statement. So, George is just reiterating that we see a more competitive world and we\u2019ll be prepared to deal with it. And we factored that into our outlook for the second half of the year.\nTrey Campbell: Operator, I think, we have time for one more question, and then we\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you, George. I have a question about your guidance for the full year. I think, it implies DCG declining again in Q4, pretty much in double-digit sequentially. So, just trying to understand, I mean is it primarily because of digestion that you talked about? And also, if you can talk about to what extent do you have visibility into Q4 or are you just taking a conservative stance because you just simply don\u2019t have visibility into Q4?\nGeorge Davis: I think, as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even comms, off very-high levels. And we expect that we continue into Q4. And so, again, I think, when we look at the full year, stronger than expected overall. This would be -- in many ways, we\u2019re delighted to be as close to our forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, we\u2019ve seen very strong demand peaking for cloud in the third quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter, peaking for comms in the second quarter, and it\u2019s just going to be a period of a little bit of digestion as one would expect.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you.\nBob Swan: Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we began. First, over the last couple years, as you know, we\u2019ve expanded our TAM in the quest to play a much larger role in our customers\u2019 success by investing in key leading technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty good about the investments that we\u2019ve been making. And last year, we wrapped up our year best year in the Company\u2019s history, entering2020. Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts. But, at the same time, we expect \u201820 to be the best year in our Company\u2019s history, our fifth record year in a row, delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected. So, competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020. Third point I\u2019d make is our execution is improved. Capacity and supply is in place. We\u2019re ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio. We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned. And we have a strong pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deliver another node of performance on 10-nanometer itself. Fourth point, at the same time, our 7-nanometer products will be delayed. We pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node. But along the way, we have taken steps, die disaggregation, advanced packaging, deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength, not as a sign of weakness that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions where it\u2019s the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers. And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we\u2019re not happy. I\u2019m not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance. But, as we sit here today, six months through the year, our people are safe. We\u2019re delivering for our customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And next 90 days from now, we\u2019ll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth. So, thanks for joining us. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks, Bob. And thank you all for joining us today. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. The atypical seasonal effects of COVID-related demand for mobility products and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 revenue for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 20% year-on-year and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 52% of our total revenue, an-all time high. Strong demand for NAND and 5G networking solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our expectations. Q2 PC-centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales, enabled through increase manufacturing supply on capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive relative to the Company average and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R&D related to 7-nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product. This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the zero dollar units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this quarter. Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, $0.13 above our guide as stronger than expected operating results from notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item. In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow, and invested $3.4 billion in CapEx with $7.7 billion of free cash flow, up 92% year-over-year. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance of our $20 billion share repurchase program and return to our historical capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize. Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer segments. Year-over-year platform volumes in ASPs were up 29% and 5% respectively. DCG adjacencies also delivered significant growth with revenue up 118% year-on-year on strong adoption of 5G networking solutions. While year-over-year comparisons for DCG benefited from a weaker Q2 \u201819, revenue in the quarter came in at the second highest level ever for DCG and the highest revenue ever in our cloud business. Revenue year-over-year was up 47% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government, and 44% for communications service providers. Operating margin was 44%, up 8% year-on-year on higher revenue and high-end compute mix. We see increased competition this year but we've also seen strong customer response to our product portfolio and now expect to end the year with market share that is somewhat higher than our original expectations. Our other data-centric businesses were up 14% year-over-year, primarily on the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting demand in our more GDP sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76% respectively, primarily on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye revenue was down 27% and operating income turned to a modest loss as the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches. NSG's record quarterly revenue of approximately $1.7 billion was up 76% year-on-year on strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing. Q2 was an all time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 million in operating income. PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on cloud strength, which was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and communications segments. Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit costs. CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year-over-year, driven by notebook demand and higher modem and Wi-Fi sales, which more than offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we begin to recover unit share in notebooks utilizing our smaller Core products, which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for our large Core products. Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year-on-year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products and the pre-PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more than offset the benefits of higher revenue. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3. But we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.2 billion with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year. In Q3, we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory draw-down softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year-over-year as accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products and lower platform revenue more than offset NAND margin improvement. We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily due to a lower FDII [ph] benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D tax credits in California, and the effect of a push-out of a foreign grant. The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.03 versus our prior rate expectation. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to full year. We're providing full year guidance although visibility remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some part or the Company's first half outperformance will be additive to our estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting revenue of $75 billion and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single-digits year-over-year. Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower modem revenue in the second half. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up approximately 10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G buildouts. After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We're also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into the second half. We expect continued global GDP-related impacts to our IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the second half of the year. Overall, our implied first half, second half revenue contribution is an anomalous 53% to 47%, as opposed to a more typical year with underserved seasonal buying patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to be 58% for the year, down 1 point versus our reasonable expectations for the year and 2 points lower year-over-year. This change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher than expected demand for our 10-nanometer products, and the push out of a government grant for our memory business. These effects coupled with softness in our IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix in DCG, and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales related to the product timing delays Bob discussed earlier. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% of revenue, down one point year-on-year. Full year spending is up versus our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the previously discussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales, and costs related to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and other portfolio actions, as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The resulting operating margin is 32%, down 1 point, year-over-year. The tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items and the lower FDII benefit. Full year EPS of $4.85 is $0.15 below our January expectations as increased server and notebook PC demand, and slightly higher equity gains are more than offset by COVID-related impacts to IOTG and Mobileye, higher product costs from accelerating 10-nanometer, a higher tax rate and the impact of improving our liquidity by raising additional debt and temporarily pausing our share buyback. The combination of our liquidity actions and the higher tax rate alone impact full year EPS by more than $0.15. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $15 billion and free cash flow of approximately $17.5 billion. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide. Very much appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors who delivered excellent results in the face of a very difficult environment. With that, I'll hand it back to Trey and we'll get to your questions. Hey, Vivek. Let me just comment on your question around what we're going to see -- what we might see next year? Next year is still going to be, as it was, when we talked about last in May \u201819 is still going to be largely a 10-nanometer with some 14-nanometer year. And the dynamics there are, as we're coming into it with having moved a little bit further along the yield curve, as we've seen more demand for 10-nanometer products in 2020 than we had expected. So, we're not going to update \u201821 at this time. But, I think, we're more concerned about what the global economy is doing than where we are on 10-nanometer. Hey Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year. So, this clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020 and where part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and I would say on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we have forecast for the year. So, that's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that. Again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer product... It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue space. And with respect to the long-term outlook, first off, our long-term margin outlook is not 57%, we've talked about it being well above that over time. But in terms of as we dynamically move, potentially move product depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more flexibility to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So, we talked a little bit about that actually back in May of \u201819 that embracing the ecosystem and balancing some of our activity externally is going to be important as we look to improving returns over time. As you look at the data-centric revenue, we'll see a number of factors that play. Obviously, year-over-year you're going to see the impact of the fall of in IoT and in Mobileye. But what we're seeing in the data -- or the DCG side is, we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all time record, so not a bad peak. We've probably peaked back in Q4 of \u201819 on enterprise and government. And while it was reasonably strong in Q1, it's -- you can see it coming down over the next few quarters. It may have -- it often has a little bit of a bounce in Q4, we'll have to see. And our comms provider, I would say, we expect Q2 to have been a peak there. And it'll start rolling off from there. So, everything on the DCG side is got a step down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and comms as our current outlook. Does that help? Yes. We expected, based on the competition's product roadmap that we would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also thought -- we've been a little bit pleasantly surprised in the strength of the demand for our products in the first half of the year and it's continuing into the second half. So, we don't think the impact will be quite as large competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on PC, we think we're going to actually gain share. I think, as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even comms, off very-high levels. And we expect that we continue into Q4. And so, again, I think, when we look at the full year, stronger than expected overall. This would be -- in many ways, we're delighted to be as close to our forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, we've seen very strong demand peaking for cloud in the third quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter, peaking for comms in the second quarter, and it's just going to be a period of a little bit of digestion as one would expect."

            "name": "Bob Swan",
            "content": "Thanks, Trey. And thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected, and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue, and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom-line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the Company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%. I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate. On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against three key priorities: Accelerating the growth of the Company; improving our execution; and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each. We're transforming the Company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but positioning our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G, and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU; it's more and more Intel silicon, inside more and more computers, so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results. I'll highlight a few examples from the past 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI, with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test the latest Intel-optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16, and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge. In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services. Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory-optimized Azure Virtual Machines. We were also excited to be a part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end fully virtualized cloud-native mobile network and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core. Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and mobility-as-a-service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading mobility-as-a-service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AV technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we were excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design wins to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units. We're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced three new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S and H series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors, and our new 10th Gen Intel Core vPro processors delivered uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel Hybrid Technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability. We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role-modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during this crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply, while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first six months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year. Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer -based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intranode improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake. Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and will be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021, led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of 2021. Let me provide some updates on our technology roadmap. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture. This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered on a petaflop-scale GPU with high bandwidth memory using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge or EMIB 2D packaging technology. Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate six-month shift in our 7-nanometer -based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology roadmap. Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be in our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of 2023. Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the six technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all six technology pillars, process; packaging; architecture; memory; interconnect; and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day. Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting non-core assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the Company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion mobility-as-a-service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India. Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth has never been more essential. But the global problems we face are bigger than any one company can solve alone. That's why we established 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which call for a collective response to revolutionize health and safety, make technology fully inclusive and help address climate change. We've also committed more than $50 million and extended our expertise, global reach and influence to combat COVID-19 as well as social injustice. The early results of our Pandemic Response Technology Initiative, which we announced earlier this week, underscore Intel's unique ability to partner and collectively solve critical problems. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this challenging time to deliver our purpose and support our customers. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I mean, first, our primary focus is on ensuring that we're delivering leadership, an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner. So, what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10-nanometer, much like what we're able to do on 14-nanometer is to get another node of performance within that -- within 10-nanometer in and of itself. So, we feel very good about our product roadmap through 2022. That being said, as we think about that next generation of products in late \u201822 and \u201823 and beyond, we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. And our priority in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But, the focus will be leadership products. So, to the extent that we need to use somebody else's process technology and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that. And if we do, there's lots of moving parts. But, the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody else's foundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our costs, continue to deliver leadership products, so we capture attractive ASPs, and reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry on an older node, or on a last gen kind of process node. So, in the aggregate, for the last couple of years with the real focus on product leadership, we've been engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way. We've been designing our products and advancing our packaging technologies, so that we have much more flexibility to decide if when we will use our fabs or somebody else's to deliver that annual cadence for leadership products. We feel very good through \u201822 timeframe. And now, we're evaluating the optionality that we have on \u201823 and beyond. I think, the first part of your question, with 2022 be in -- in essence say, it's full array of 10-nanometer product, the expectation is, all else equal, little more 10-nanometer spend and less 7-nanometers spend, provided we decide to continue to do all of our production inside. In the event we decide that we're going to leverage third-party foundries more effectively, we would add a little more 10 and a lot less 7. And that's kind of the optionality that we've try to build in as we evaluate the future of Moore's law. And that's in technology development leadership. In the event we're not there and there's a better alternative, be prepared to take advantage of it. Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly two quarters while process we expect now to be roughly four quarters. The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things. One, a buffer and our planning process between process and product to make sure that we don't -- minimal disruption on customers, because of process. Second, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside, and therefore further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage. So, that's why, we've been able to be confident in a six-month products slip, even though process was moving out 12 months. In terms of -- I think your second question was about, we've seen this movie before, maybe. And I think, the important of our many lessons coming out of 10-nanometer. One of them was how do we ensure that we have contingency plans, in the event that our advancements in process technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership products for our customers on that annual cadence? So, I'm sure things won't play out exactly the way we want. We think we've dialed in a 7. But, at the same time, what's different is we're going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match, inside and outside or go outside in its entirety, if we need to. And that's kind of one of our learnings coming out of 10 is in the event process doesn't move along as we expect, let's make absolutely sure with advanced contingency planning, and real milestones that we can switch the best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in light of process complexities. Maybe, I'll flip those around. Over the last couple of years, we've been talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically, when do we use third-party foundries, rather than do everything ourselves. And we call that engaging in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a variety of different reasons, so we don't have to build everything ourselves as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So, in general, I would say for planning purposes, we've been engaging with the ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 28% to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business. Your first question in terms of planning then, we feel like we have a real solid product roadmap, again for the second half of this year for \u201821 and for \u201822 and that we'll do it on our existing 10-nanometer that's ramping fast than we expected, it yields in line with what we expected. So, for the near-term, we think we got a great lineup of products and we expect to fight and protect our share, while standing the role we play in a variety of different places in the industry. But, now is when we're planning for \u201820, \u201823. And we are evaluating now in light of where we are, where we think the industries, the competition or third parties are, evaluating now what's the best option for us to make sure that we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. And those decisions are not decisions that we'll make in 2023. Those decisions, based on the information that we have along the way, will be made long before then. Whether it's decisions that are about how much capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage more effectively somebody else's process capabilities and factories, so that we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed. Well, I think I'll start with our full year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. Let me just finish this. I think it's a good question that maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So, full year demand to the Company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer, we've kind of said are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first six months. And we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, both because customers are demanding it more, the implications are that our margins all else equal, will be lower. And George kind of highlighted those are the primary drivers of a 1 point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster and our 5G comms business in the data center group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put that -- I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category. We feel -- we know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think it's a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield if it's more of our growth than we had anticipated. All else equal margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume all else equal will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you. Yes. On Ponte Vecchio, originally the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes an IO based die, connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of package together. That's kind of the design of Ponte Vecchio. From the beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles outside, and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of how do we mix and match different designs into one package. So, that was the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff inside some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio is really -- Ponte Vecchio on the data center side and Lakefield on the client side, were kind of our test products, both -- one of which we've launched, the other one which is in development. So, that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility. As we go forward now, we can think about whether we introduce Ponte Vecchio with -- I think, I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from the beginning. Now, as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out one of our tiles for a third-party foundry or not. Again, that's the beauty and value of this change and design methodology that gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So, in the event, there's a process slip, we can buy something rather than make it all ourselves. When we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made that statement. So, George is just reiterating that we see a more competitive world and we'll be prepared to deal with it. And we factored that into our outlook for the second half of the year. Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we began. First, over the last couple years, as you know, we've expanded our TAM in the quest to play a much larger role in our customers' success by investing in key leading technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty good about the investments that we've been making. And last year, we wrapped up our year best year in the Company's history, entering2020. Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts. But, at the same time, we expect \u201820 to be the best year in our Company's history, our fifth record year in a row, delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected. So, competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020. Third point I'd make is our execution is improved. Capacity and supply is in place. We're ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio. We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned. And we have a strong pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deliver another node of performance on 10-nanometer itself. Fourth point, at the same time, our 7-nanometer products will be delayed. We pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node. But along the way, we have taken steps, die disaggregation, advanced packaging, deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength, not as a sign of weakness that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions where it's the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers. And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we're not happy. I'm not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance. But, as we sit here today, six months through the year, our people are safe. We're delivering for our customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And next 90 days from now, we'll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth. So, thanks for joining us. And we'll talk to you soon."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Trey Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTrey Campbell: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you\u2019ve not received both documents, they\u2019re available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we\u2019ll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we\u2019ll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob.\nBob Swan: Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the Company\u2019s revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%. We\u2019ll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites. Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our number one priority. That\u2019s why we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, including a special recognition award for employees that have been working on site. Intel\u2019s purpose is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that purpose been more essential. Intel technology runs 95% of the world\u2019s Internet communication and government digital infrastructure. And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our customers are providing a unifying fabric that\u2019s bringing us closer together, helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver goods and services. Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 as hospitals and health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our products and capabilities are also delivering vital computing power for medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global communities need us to continue delivering technology to help overcome this COVID-19 challenge, and we\u2019re fully focused on that task. Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on-time delivery. We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories\u2019 operations. By design, our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world. While most of our construction projects have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line. We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world\u2019s innovation in new ways. Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis. To that end, we\u2019ve pledged $50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are also granting free access to our IP to all COVID-19 researchers and scientists. At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. Between Intel and our foundation, we are providing $10 million towards coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, medical equipment and small business support. We also want to assist our communities\u2019 critically important health care workers in any way possible, so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment. We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other gear that we\u2019ve sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need. Beyond Intel\u2019s donations, our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills, generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis. George will give more detail on what we\u2019re seeing and expect in the business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even as COVID-19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long-term strategy, to deliver the world\u2019s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our priorities are unwavering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our factories. Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we\u2019ve expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS, FPGAS, GPUs and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers\u2019 success. And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move, store and process data. Through this crisis, the world\u2019s cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers. Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have now become indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, to help our customers meet these growing needs. These two segments now drive 70% of our data center segment revenue. New usages and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19. One example is Medical Informatics\u2019 Sickbay platform. Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly. Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within one day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is largely stalled, Mobileye delivered another proof point, demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM. Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make. AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries, including cutting-edge health care diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19. Our combined work will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and create better diagnostic methods. And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform. We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also now sampling Habana\u2019s first deep learning training processor to large CSPs. I\u2019ll now take a few minutes to discuss how we\u2019re executing to our supply and road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China, force many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and fulfill all of our customers\u2019 committed client CPU orders as expected. We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more normal levels. Near-term PC demand has increased due to work from home and online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We continue to assess how COVID-19 impacts to the economy will offset the immediate catalysts for more remote work and will balance wafer start plans accordingly. We have made strong progress on a wave of 10-nanometer-based product introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10-nanometer-based new addition to our portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to be the base station market segment leader by 2021, a year earlier than previously committed. In the middle of this year, we\u2019ll debut our next-generation mobile processor, Tiger Lake. Using our second-generation 10-nanometer process, Tiger Lake will deliver breakthrough performance, and our customers have more than 50 fantastic Tiger Lake-based notebook designs lined up for the holiday season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. While product development in a work-from-home environment is extremely challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables. We are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your capital. We generate significant cash flow and have an excellent balance sheet. We\u2019re committed to our dividends, and we repurchased $4.2 billion in shares during the quarter. In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen our liquidity position that we felt were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as circumstances warrant. Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, including an agreement to divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We have transformed our company to lead the data-driven revolution that\u2019s fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID-19 has only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our customers to accelerate the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one. To use Andy Grove\u2019s words, bad companies are destroyed by crises. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by our cultural values, competitive advantages and financial strength, we will emerge from this situation even stronger. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to George for more details on our Q1 results, our Q2 outlook and how we\u2019re actively managing the business through this challenge.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong demand for both PCs and servers as work-from-home and learn-from-home dynamics played out globally. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% year-on-year and $800 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.1 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 51% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business. Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the environment. Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios, along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment. In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.3 billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year-over-year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share repurchase program as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning $20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to resume the program when market dynamics stabilize. With Q1 buybacks at $4.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1. Let\u2019s move to segment performance in Q1. Data Center Group revenue of $7 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 2019, revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG. Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35% year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions. Our other data-centric businesses were up 19% year-over-year in Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 3%, primarily on lower revenue from industrial and retail. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially by eroding conditions in the automotive market. While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19. NSG revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market conditions versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million. PSG revenue grew 7% year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength, partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment. Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 billion in Q1, up 14% year-over-year, driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders. Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year-on-year, on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Let\u2019s move to our second quarter outlook. Given the environment and the global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25% year-over-year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%, down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin, largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily to three reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lower sequential revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products, including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC. The Tiger Lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are monitoring and our response to the market dynamics. Tailwinds are most evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in place. In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened liquidity. In addition to spending repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. We have positioned the company to support investment in technology transitions, our new products, and our customers\u2019 requirements across these scenarios. As you would expect, we are very focused on cash flow management and believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital oversight. To conclude, I\u2019d like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide who are working diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the world. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Trey, and we\u2019ll get to your questions.\nTrey Campbell: All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As this our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the gross margin decline heading into the calendar second quarter. George, you kind of broke it up into three different categories. I\u2019d be interested on magnitude of Tiger Lake versus just lower volumes and then other 10-nanometer parts. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about kind of normalized sort of gross margins as you get past some of the start-up costs for a faster 10-nanometer ramp?\nGeorge Davis: Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what we\u2019ve talked about in the past in terms of how we think our product road map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin structure. And what you\u2019re seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue. And about half of the impact that you\u2019re seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that \u2013 and that\u2019s both sequentially and year-over-year. And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we\u2019re not seeing anything as \u2013 if you take COVID out of the year, we\u2019re really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics, with the exception of we\u2019re seeing stronger pull-in of demand for some of our 10-nanometer products. I mean I think one of the things \u2013 we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter, it\u2019s about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of 2019. And yet we have about double the number of units in the \u2013 being reserved. And I think it gives you an indication of just how much our performance was improving on 10-nanometer.\nBob Swan: So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross margins are stronger through the first quarter. They\u2019re in line with our expectations through the second quarter. And to George\u2019s point, despite the timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel confident in accelerating the ramp for 10. So from our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the year, and we feel very good about gross margin performance. We\u2019re very excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announced. So all in all, gross margin dynamics, pretty strong. On the second part of your question, I\u2019d go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a new node, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2 to 2.5-year cadence, which means in 2021, we\u2019ll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we\u2019re investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021. So those dynamics of \u2013 from a mature node to a new node, impacts the gross margins of the business, but we feel like it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re well on track from the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and an outlook for the second quarter in line or better than what we expected.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question please.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a follow-on, John, with the gross margin. I mean I know you\u2019re not guiding full year anymore, but when we look out at that trajectory that you had given us, I was wondering if you can just kind of step us through with the acceleration. And actually, maybe looking back to last year, if you look at the improvement you saw of that low quarter, just kind of any kind of directional guidance of where this gross margin can go from here.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. I mean first off, I think you\u2019re going to see, Blayne, that gross margin is going to improve, all things being equal, just from the fact that starting in the third quarter, we\u2019ll start to see the chips that have been reserved this quarter coming out on a zero cost basis in the gross margin. And again, it\u2019s really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance, which is because of the \u2013 all the obvious issues related to COVID. I\u2019d just go back to \u2013 as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of 2019, if anything, we\u2019re ramping 10-nanometer a little faster. We\u2019re seeing clear evidence of improved performance on 10-nanometer. And so we feel good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of the 6-point impact that\u2019s being offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay COVID, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and I appreciate all the color in these uncertain times. I\u2019m curious how you are directionally feeling about the CapEx guidance for the year. I think you had about a $17 billion number before. I understand the need to be responsive to the macro dynamics and in preserving the balance sheet. But you upsided first half by quite a bit, and you\u2019re also accelerating the move to 10-nanometers. Does that create some upward bias or at least protect the kind of capital spending plans that you had for the year? Any puts and takes would be very helpful. Thank you.\nBob Swan: Yes. Vivek, I\u2019ll start, and then George will fill in. First, both our R&D and our capital spend for this year are directed towards the multiyear plan that we shared with you back last year. So both the product road map over the next several years, the capital required to support the growth that we anticipate over the medium to long-term horizon while adding capacity for the ramp of 10 as well. So coming into the year, we\u2019re very bullish about the medium and long-term outlook. And we\u2019re putting our capital to work to support that medium and long-term outlook, and that\u2019s not going to change. That being said, in the near term, as we try to get a better read on what the demand signals will be for the second half, whether we\u2019re dealing with being very disciplined on our spending levels, ensuring that wafer starts are in line with true demand signals and being very disciplined on the capital that isn\u2019t directly related to more capacity and/or technology development, we are going to be very disciplined through this near-term horizon. But I\u2019d just go back to the first point, which is we\u2019re very bullish about the multiyear view. We have the largest TAM in the company\u2019s history. We got a great set of products that we\u2019re building and developing, and we\u2019re going to invest to position ourselves well to capitalize on the current disruptions that we\u2019re wrestling with.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. What I would add is there\u2019s some natural things in addition to the discipline that will help us lower CapEx a little bit. It\u2019s part of why we said we think our free cash flow is going to be pretty resilient in the year because we\u2019ve seen in some of the geographies where we have major construction projects underway, we\u2019re actually seeing that being pushed somewhat by regulatory requirements. And so we \u2013 the way I would describe it is we probably see six to eight weeks\u2019 worth of capital pushing out of this year. But any capital that is important for our 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and even the start of 5-nanometer is going to be spent in line with the timetables that we\u2019ve already laid out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about some of the changes to the server road map? And it seems like you\u2019ve deemphasized Cooper Lake and are more focused on Ice Lake server. Is that about confidence of the \u2013 in the 10-nanometer plus? Is that \u2013 just kind of describe what led to that decision.\nBob Swan: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes, during the course of the year, we\u2019ve been \u2013 our product road map for servers is very focused on delivering workload-optimized platform foundation that\u2019s scalable for the real-world environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped \u2013 Skylake was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because the architecture is very simple to the fastest-growing Cascade Lake ramp. And we\u2019re very focused on Ice Lake in the second half of the year or in the fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lake and refresh while positioning for Ice Lake.\nJoe Moore: Okay. That makes sense. And as you\u2019ve started to ramp 10-nanometer plus, is it possible to talk about the changes that you\u2019ll see versus 10? Is it better clock speeds, better yields, better \u2013 is there better transistor performance implicit in that transition?\nBob Swan: I presume you\u2019re talking about second gen for server products, Sapphire Rapids product or \u2013 oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client \u2013 the Tiger Lake product, we are extremely excited about. We \u2013 as I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentiator for customers on \u2013 in thin and light format. So this is going to be a great launch. We\u2019re very excited about it. And to George\u2019s earlier point, the demand signals we\u2019re seeing and our confidence in both the product and the yield is \u2013 has us at a point where we expect to accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask first about the 10-nanometer mix exiting the year just given what you\u2019re seeing: a strong Tiger Lake demand signals and a potentially faster 10-nanometer. Like what do you think your product mix by node is going to be exiting the year? Do you think there\u2019ll be a crossover point on 10-nanometers?\nGeorge Davis: Stacy, this is George. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a crossover point this year. And this is \u2013 again, I\u2019m just going to take COVID out of the equation, so thinking through, I do think we\u2019re going to see more demand on 10-nanometer this year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong \u2013 is going to be strong in the first half. We\u2019re seeing our 5G SoCs on 10-nanometer getting stronger demand as the market there just gets stronger and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob just covered. And \u2013 but it won\u2019t be enough to cause a crossover.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRoss Seymore: Hey, guys. Thanks for that. I want to go to the Data Center Group, you have the color commentary about the enterprise and government being weaker in the second half, and I don\u2019t think that surprises anybody. But I wanted to see what sort of color you\u2019re getting in the other 70% of that segment on the cloud and the comms side? And specifically, you had worried earlier this year that we\u2019d enter a digestion period. So I wanted to see if your views have changed on that. And then in the comms service provider side, how much of that actually acts like the enterprise and government versus the side that benefits from the 5G ramp? Any pluses and minuses there would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nBob Swan: Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were that Q1 would continue that strength. But then the cloud service providers would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of what we indicated back in January. First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In our raised outlook for Q2, we expect that demand for the cloud folks to \u2013 the strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of the year, that\u2019s TBD, but the trends are relatively encouraging, the demand signals are very high. The product that\u2019s being pulled is the XCC product. So ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong. So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively strong kind of going into Q3. That\u2019s TBD. On the comms side, fantastic growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share in that segment. And as we\u2019ve expanded the 5G SoC, expanded our TAM within that sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks back. So we expect share gains, the infrastructure \u2013 share gains to continue, infrastructure in 5G to continue, if not go faster, and we\u2019re relatively well positioned in the \u2013 with the key players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment as well. And as you flagged, the ones that we\u2019re proud \u2013 that we\u2019re most anxious about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals we\u2019ll see in the second half. So the first two are as good, if not stronger. Enterprise and government, a big \u2013 a bit of an unknown for us at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your question please.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019d like to get back to your performance in PC in the first quarter. So you\u2019re up 40% year-on-year. I was wondering a couple of things. The first one is how much is that really stronger demand, and that\u2019s just about it? And how much of that is more you catching up on capacity and being better able to serve the market and catching up maybe on demand you couldn\u2019t meet in the two, three previous quarters? And then what\u2019s your early view on market share? Are you starting to regain share in PCs? And if not, when do you see that happening this year?\nGeorge Davis: Pierre, it\u2019s George. I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home, learn-at-home dynamics. But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the dynamics that we\u2019re talking about. We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some \u2013 a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically. But we saw notebook volumes up over 20% in the quarter. And I would say that that\u2019s more than just the pent-up demand. And that\u2019s at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains, which is why there\u2019s some parts in their channel that\u2019s all opened up now. So we think that actually \u2013 one of the good signs is though even that\u2019s opened up, we\u2019re still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So \u2013 and we had expected solid PC in the first half. But I would say it\u2019s \u2013 with COVID, it\u2019s been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the notebook.\nBob Swan: And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain was able to \u2013 coming out of last year, not only able to deal with the backlog coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George flagged at the latter part of March.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. I should have mentioned that. It\u2019s really heroic work, both at the supply chain level, we have a fantastic supply chain group, but also our manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering 90% on-time commits in a quarter like this is really remarkable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question please.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I realized that you removed your guidance for the full year. But if I look at your results and your guide for Q2, it would suggest data-centric tracking, maybe down 2% half-on-half in the second half; and PC, down 14%. I\u2019m just curious, is that directionally how you\u2019re seeing things? Or I guess given the positive the positive trends in notebooks and the weakness on the enterprise and government side, perhaps it\u2019s a bit more muted, and would love to hear your thoughts on that.\nGeorge Davis: Yes. We\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be able to give you a full year guide by pieces. But I appreciate the question. I think the \u2013 maybe talking a little bit, C.J., headwinds and tailwinds, which we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a tailwind and \u2013 cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for sure. I think cloud continues to be \u2013 will probably be helpful throughout the year. The \u2013 but at some point, we\u2019re going to see the impacts of the recession start to impact demand on PCs. So we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s certainly a headwind. That is a reasonable expectation for the second half of the year. We\u2019re already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG, particularly in industrial and retail. We\u2019re seeing in automotive, Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They\u2019re in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially. And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the data center side, enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those things all play up and what percentages play out, C.J., I really can\u2019t say, but those are the things that we\u2019re watching to see how the year is going to play out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. Your question please.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. George, I want to go back to the gross margins. I think you did a great job giving us color about half of the impact from Tiger Lake. I\u2019m just wondering, the remaining half, is that because of reserves, which is going to reverse in the second half? Or is this something more structural or mix related that\u2019s going to persist for the next few quarters? I would love to hear some color on that. Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: Well, I think the things that are structural is we\u2019re going to see more 10-nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. And that will have a little bit of dampening on margins but not materially different from what we had seen coming into the year. The temporary impact is really the reserve action, which will reverse. It is about half of the year-over-year effect. And so I would say the other impact, again, is if we look year-over-year, we\u2019re just seeing a much larger uptake of Ice Lake and 5G SoCs year-over-year, but much of that was expected. I would say both Ice Lake and the 5G SoCs are a little bit stronger than we would have thought coming into the year and \u2013 which is consistent with just the demand activity that we\u2019re seeing in mobility and the infrastructure around that.\nBob Swan: Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin for the year. And I would just say through the first 90 days, we\u2019re much better. To the next 90 days, we\u2019re better or in line. And the dynamics of the pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net-net, to the first six months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin performance and even better about our ability to ramp 10-nanometer. So we\u2019re feeling very good about how the first half of the year is playing out relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross margin performance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk about channel. Inventory, there\u2019s a \u2013 customers in a lot of your end markets seem to be a little concerned about supply disruptions, and they \u2013 sell-in seems to be a little bit above sell-through. Sell-through seems to be weakening a little bit. So can you talk about the potential for some inventory correction later this year and sort of how you track that? Thanks.\nGeorge Davis: We\u2019re \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re very focused on understanding that. I would say the \u2013 any kind of dislocation that we\u2019re looking at right now is more a function of just the supply chain challenges that some of the OEMs had, particularly in the first half of the first quarter. But we\u2019ve been watching that pretty closely because we want to make sure that this kind of buildup at our customer level makes its way through to the end customer. And we\u2019re seeing customers telling us that their end-customer demand continues to be very strong, and their order profile reflects that they\u2019re going to clear their existing revenue. Now when that plays out, I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s part of why we struggle to understand how that second half is going to play out. But we feel good about the demand signals we\u2019re seeing now, and we understand the movements of our products in the system from the dynamics that we saw in the first quarter.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks, Tim. Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.\nOperator: Our final question then comes from Chris Danely from Citi. Your question please.\nChris Danely: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you just run down the supply demand sort of balance throughout the server, desktop and notebook lines? I guess are you on track for the high single-digit unit increase in output? And then did the shortages anywhere get any worse during the during Q1? Or it sounds like they\u2019re abating in certain areas? Just any color there would be great.\nBob Swan: Yes. On \u2013 as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention \u2013 well, we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another mid-20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong output. And we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was greater for \u2013 across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we were able to keep pace with accelerating demand as the quarter closed. So we\u2019re in pretty good shape in terms of the promise we\u2019ve made to our customers, and that is that we will not \u2013 we\u2019ll put the capacity in place so we are not a constraint on their growth. So we\u2019re in very good shape despite all the challenges. That being said by, we haven\u2019t replenished inventory levels. So meaning mix dynamics across the board is \u2013 we\u2019re still not quite there yet, but we\u2019re in line a little bit better than we had hoped. We delivered more demand, and we got to continue to build the inventory levels back so we can deal with the variation by SKU mix.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks, Chris.\nBob Swan: Yes. So look, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I just kind of want to wrap with \u2013 to reiterate our purpose, and that is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. And that\u2019s never been more important than it is during this time. Our strategy is resolute, and our business is built to withstand challenges. We have a very diversified portfolio of businesses that are highly leveraged to major technology inflections like cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and artificial intelligence. We generate significant and durable free cash flows, and our team of 110,000 people is operating as one team to enable our customers\u2019 success. So guided by our cultural values, our competitive advantages and our financial strength, we\u2019re confident that we will emerge from this situation even stronger. Thanks again for joining us. We hope you all stay safe as we work together to overcome this global crisis. And we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person over the near term. Thanks again for joining us.\nTrey Campbell: Thanks, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call?\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong demand for both PCs and servers as work-from-home and learn-from-home dynamics played out globally. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% year-on-year and $800 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.1 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 51% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business. Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the environment. Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios, along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment. In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.3 billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year-over-year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share repurchase program as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning $20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to resume the program when market dynamics stabilize. With Q1 buybacks at $4.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1. Let's move to segment performance in Q1. Data Center Group revenue of $7 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 2019, revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG. Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35% year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions. Our other data-centric businesses were up 19% year-over-year in Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 3%, primarily on lower revenue from industrial and retail. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially by eroding conditions in the automotive market. While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19. NSG revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market conditions versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million. PSG revenue grew 7% year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength, partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment. Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 billion in Q1, up 14% year-over-year, driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders. Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year-on-year, on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Let's move to our second quarter outlook. Given the environment and the global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25% year-over-year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%, down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin, largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily to three reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lower sequential revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products, including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC. The Tiger Lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are monitoring and our response to the market dynamics. Tailwinds are most evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in place. In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened liquidity. In addition to spending repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. We have positioned the company to support investment in technology transitions, our new products, and our customers' requirements across these scenarios. As you would expect, we are very focused on cash flow management and believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital oversight. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide who are working diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the world. With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions. Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what we've talked about in the past in terms of how we think our product road map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin structure. And what you're seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue. And about half of the impact that you're seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that \u2013 and that's both sequentially and year-over-year. And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we're not seeing anything as \u2013 if you take COVID out of the year, we're really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics, with the exception of we're seeing stronger pull-in of demand for some of our 10-nanometer products. I mean I think one of the things \u2013 we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter, it's about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of 2019. And yet we have about double the number of units in the \u2013 being reserved. And I think it gives you an indication of just how much our performance was improving on 10-nanometer. Yes. I mean first off, I think you're going to see, Blayne, that gross margin is going to improve, all things being equal, just from the fact that starting in the third quarter, we'll start to see the chips that have been reserved this quarter coming out on a zero cost basis in the gross margin. And again, it's really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance, which is because of the \u2013 all the obvious issues related to COVID. I'd just go back to \u2013 as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of 2019, if anything, we're ramping 10-nanometer a little faster. We're seeing clear evidence of improved performance on 10-nanometer. And so we feel good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of the 6-point impact that's being offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay COVID, it's \u2013 we'll just have to see how that plays out. Yes. What I would add is there's some natural things in addition to the discipline that will help us lower CapEx a little bit. It's part of why we said we think our free cash flow is going to be pretty resilient in the year because we've seen in some of the geographies where we have major construction projects underway, we're actually seeing that being pushed somewhat by regulatory requirements. And so we \u2013 the way I would describe it is we probably see six to eight weeks' worth of capital pushing out of this year. But any capital that is important for our 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and even the start of 5-nanometer is going to be spent in line with the timetables that we've already laid out. Stacy, this is George. I don't think we'll see a crossover point this year. And this is \u2013 again, I'm just going to take COVID out of the equation, so thinking through, I do think we're going to see more demand on 10-nanometer this year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong \u2013 is going to be strong in the first half. We're seeing our 5G SoCs on 10-nanometer getting stronger demand as the market there just gets stronger and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob just covered. And \u2013 but it won't be enough to cause a crossover. Pierre, it's George. I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home, learn-at-home dynamics. But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the dynamics that we're talking about. We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some \u2013 a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically. But we saw notebook volumes up over 20% in the quarter. And I would say that that's more than just the pent-up demand. And that's at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains, which is why there's some parts in their channel that's all opened up now. So we think that actually \u2013 one of the good signs is though even that's opened up, we're still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So \u2013 and we had expected solid PC in the first half. But I would say it's \u2013 with COVID, it's been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the notebook. Yes. I should have mentioned that. It's really heroic work, both at the supply chain level, we have a fantastic supply chain group, but also our manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering 90% on-time commits in a quarter like this is really remarkable. Yes. We're \u2013 I'm not going to be able to give you a full year guide by pieces. But I appreciate the question. I think the \u2013 maybe talking a little bit, C.J., headwinds and tailwinds, which we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a tailwind and \u2013 cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for sure. I think cloud continues to be \u2013 will probably be helpful throughout the year. The \u2013 but at some point, we're going to see the impacts of the recession start to impact demand on PCs. So we're \u2013 that's certainly a headwind. That is a reasonable expectation for the second half of the year. We're already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG, particularly in industrial and retail. We're seeing in automotive, Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They're in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially. And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the data center side, enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those things all play up and what percentages play out, C.J., I really can't say, but those are the things that we're watching to see how the year is going to play out. Well, I think the things that are structural is we're going to see more 10-nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year.

I would say the \u2013 any kind of dislocation that we're looking at right now is more a function of just the supply chain challenges that some of the OEMs had, particularly in the first half of the first quarter. But we've been watching that pretty closely because we want to make sure that this kind of buildup at our customer level makes its way through to the end customer. And we're seeing customers telling us that their end-customer demand continues to be very strong, and their order profile reflects that they're going to clear their existing revenue. Now when that plays out, I'm not sure. It's part of why we struggle to understand how that second half is going to play out. But we feel good about the demand signals we're seeing now, and we understand the movements of our products in the system from the dynamics that we saw in the first quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the Company's revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%. We'll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites. Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our number one priority. That's why we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, including a special recognition award for employees that have been working on site. Intel's purpose is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that purpose been more essential. Intel technology runs 95% of the world's Internet communication and government digital infrastructure. And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our customers are providing a unifying fabric that's bringing us closer together, helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver goods and services. Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 as hospitals and health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our products and capabilities are also delivering vital computing power for medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global communities need us to continue delivering technology to help overcome this COVID-19 challenge, and we're fully focused on that task. Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on-time delivery. We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories' operations. By design, our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world. While most of our construction projects have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line. We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world's innovation in new ways. Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis. To that end, we've pledged $50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are also granting free access to our IP to all COVID-19 researchers and scientists. At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. Between Intel and our foundation, we are providing $10 million towards coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, medical equipment and small business support. We also want to assist our communities' critically important health care workers in any way possible, so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment. We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other gear that we've sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need. Beyond Intel's donations, our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills, generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis. George will give more detail on what we're seeing and expect in the business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even as COVID-19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long-term strategy, to deliver the world's best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our priorities are unwavering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Over the last several years, we've transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our factories. Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we've expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS, FPGAS, GPUs and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move, store and process data. Through this crisis, the world's cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers. Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have now become indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, to help our customers meet these growing needs. These two segments now drive 70% of our data center segment revenue. New usages and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19. One example is Medical Informatics' Sickbay platform. Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly. Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within one day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is largely stalled, Mobileye delivered another proof point, demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM. Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make. AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries, including cutting-edge health care diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19. Our combined work will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and create better diagnostic methods. And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform. We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also now sampling Habana's first deep learning training processor to large CSPs. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss how we're executing to our supply and road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China, force many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and fulfill all of our customers' committed client CPU orders as expected. We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more normal levels. Near-term PC demand has increased due to work from home and online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We continue to assess how COVID-19 impacts to the economy will offset the immediate catalysts for more remote work and will balance wafer start plans accordingly. We have made strong progress on a wave of 10-nanometer-based product introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10-nanometer-based new addition to our portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to be the base station market segment leader by 2021, a year earlier than previously committed. In the middle of this year, we'll debut our next-generation mobile processor, Tiger Lake. Using our second-generation 10-nanometer process, Tiger Lake will deliver breakthrough performance, and our customers have more than 50 fantastic Tiger Lake-based notebook designs lined up for the holiday season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. While product development in a work-from-home environment is extremely challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables. We are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your capital. We generate significant cash flow and have an excellent balance sheet. We're committed to our dividends, and we repurchased $4.2 billion in shares during the quarter. In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen our liquidity position that we felt were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as circumstances warrant. Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, including an agreement to divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We have transformed our company to lead the data-driven revolution that's fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID-19 has only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our customers to accelerate the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one. To use Andy Grove's words, bad companies are destroyed by crises. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by our cultural values, competitive advantages and financial strength, we will emerge from this situation even stronger. I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our Q1 results, our Q2 outlook and how we're actively managing the business through this challenge. So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross margins are stronger through the first quarter. They're in line with our expectations through the second quarter. And to George's point, despite the timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel confident in accelerating the ramp for 10. So from our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the year, and we feel very good about gross margin performance. We're very excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announced. So all in all, gross margin dynamics, pretty strong. On the second part of your question, I'd go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a new node, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2 to 2.5-year cadence, which means in 2021, we'll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we're investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021. So those dynamics of \u2013 from a mature node to a new node, impacts the gross margins of the business, but we feel like it's \u2013 we're well on track from the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and an outlook for the second quarter in line or better than what we expected. Yes. Vivek, I'll start, and then George will fill in. First, both our R&D and our capital spend for this year are directed towards the multiyear plan that we shared with you back last year. So both the product road map over the next several years, the capital required to support the growth that we anticipate over the medium to long-term horizon while adding capacity for the ramp of 10 as well. So coming into the year, we're very bullish about the medium and long-term outlook. And we're putting our capital to work to support that medium and long-term outlook, and that's not going to change. That being said, in the near term, as we try to get a better read on what the demand signals will be for the second half, whether we're dealing with being very disciplined on our spending levels, ensuring that wafer starts are in line with true demand signals and being very disciplined on the capital that isn't directly related to more capacity and/or technology development, we are going to be very disciplined through this near-term horizon. But I'd just go back to the first point, which is we're very bullish about the multiyear view. We have the largest TAM in the company's history. We got a great set of products that we're building and developing, and we're going to invest to position ourselves well to capitalize on the current disruptions that we're wrestling with. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes, during the course of the year, we've been \u2013 our product road map for servers is very focused on delivering workload-optimized platform foundation that's scalable for the real-world environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped \u2013 Skylake was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because the architecture is very simple to the fastest-growing Cascade Lake ramp. And we're very focused on Ice Lake in the second half of the year or in the fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lake and refresh while positioning for Ice Lake. I presume you're talking about second gen for server products, Sapphire Rapids product or \u2013 oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client \u2013 the Tiger Lake product, we are extremely excited about. We \u2013 as I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentiator for customers on \u2013 in thin and light format. So this is going to be a great launch. We're very excited about it. And to George's earlier point, the demand signals we're seeing and our confidence in both the product and the yield is \u2013 has us at a point where we expect to accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the year. Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were that Q1 would continue that strength. But then the cloud service providers would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of what we indicated back in January. First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In our raised outlook for Q2, we expect that demand for the cloud folks to \u2013 the strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of the year, that's TBD, but the trends are relatively encouraging, the demand signals are very high. The product that's being pulled is the XCC product. So ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong. So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively strong kind of going into Q3. That's TBD. On the comms side, fantastic growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share in that segment. And as we've expanded the 5G SoC, expanded our TAM within that sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks back. So we expect share gains, the infrastructure \u2013 share gains to continue, infrastructure in 5G to continue, if not go faster, and we're relatively well positioned in the \u2013 with the key players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment as well. And as you flagged, the ones that we're proud \u2013 that we're most anxious about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals we'll see in the second half. So the first two are as good, if not stronger. Enterprise and government, a big \u2013 a bit of an unknown for us at this stage. And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain was able to \u2013 coming out of last year, not only able to deal with the backlog coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George flagged at the latter part of March. Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin for the year. And I would just say through the first 90 days, we're much better. To the next 90 days, we're better or in line. And the dynamics of the pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net-net, to the first six months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin performance and even better about our ability to ramp 10-nanometer. So we're feeling very good about how the first half of the year is playing out relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross margin performance. Yes. On \u2013 as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention \u2013 well, we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another mid-20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong output. And we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was greater for \u2013 across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we were able to keep pace with accelerating demand as the quarter closed. So we're in pretty good shape in terms of the promise we've made to our customers, and that is that we will not \u2013 we'll put the capacity in place so we are not a constraint on their growth. So we're in very good shape despite all the challenges. That being said by, we haven't replenished inventory levels. So meaning mix dynamics across the board is \u2013 we're still not quite there yet, but we're in line a little bit better than we had hoped. We delivered more demand, and we got to continue to build the inventory levels back so we can deal with the variation by SKU mix. Yes. So look, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I just kind of want to wrap with \u2013 to reiterate our purpose, and that is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. And that's never been more important than it is during this time. Our strategy is resolute, and our business is built to withstand challenges. We have a very diversified portfolio of businesses that are highly leveraged to major technology inflections like cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and artificial intelligence. We generate significant and durable free cash flows, and our team of 110,000 people is operating as one team to enable our customers' success. So guided by our cultural values, our competitive advantages and our financial strength, we're confident that we will emerge from this situation even stronger. Thanks again for joining us. We hope you all stay safe as we work together to overcome this global crisis. And we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person over the near term. Thanks again for joining us."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 2021 Intel Corp. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Tony Balow, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nTony Balow: Thank you, operator. Welcome to Intel's fourth quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you have not received both documents, they are available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our new CFO, Dave Zinsner. Also joining us is our prior CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Pat and Dave followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and, as such, it does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include both the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. In today's call, we will be discussing both the Q4 2021 and the full year 2021 results, providing forward-looking guidance for Q1 '22. We will be providing guidance for full year '22 at our Investor Day on February 17.  With that, let me hand it over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say welcome to Dave, who is joining us for his first earnings call. Many of you know Dave well and know his track record of successfully driving shareholder value. We're very excited to have him join our team. I also want to take a moment to thank George for his many contributions during the critical period in the company's transformation. Everyone here at Intel wishes him all the best in his future endeavors as he begins his planned retirement in May. Q4 was a tremendous finish to a transformational year where we beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. We exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $1 billion on the top line, finishing with our best quarter and our best full year revenue ever. We had a record quarter for DCG, where we grew 20% year-on-year and where we continue to be the partner of choice for cloud and data center customers. We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021. We had a record year for our client business. And in Q4, we outperformed our plan and delivered another $10 billion quarter, highlighting again that the PC is more essential than ever. Continuing our momentum as the market leader in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye grew more than 40% year-on-year in 2021, delivering a 14th consecutive year of revenue growth. And finally, IOTG had another $1 billion quarter to cap a record year as the need for compute at the edge continues to grow. Supporting these record results, our manufacturing network continued its superb execution throughout the year. As an IDM, we were able to rapidly adjust to support customers' mix changes, often with a normal lead time, and manufactured more than 2 million wafers. We broke ground on 2 new fabs in Arizona 3 months ahead of schedule as part of the largest overall manufacturing expansion in Intel's history and all while managing a challenging COVID environment and focusing on the safety of our employees, suppliers and partners. We also took several in a series of key steps to shape our business. To begin with, we've recently completed the first close of the sale of our NAND business on time, a critical step in optimizing our portfolio in line with our new strategy. Second, we began unfolding our plan to find innovative ways to sustainably unlock shareholder value with the announcement of our intent to take Mobileye public in 2022.  Third, just last week, we announced our new manufacturing site in Ohio, which will support our future growth and advances our plan to create a more geographically balanced, resilient supply chain. While there is a lot left to do, we're building momentum, and we intend to continue our laser focus on execution, innovation and growing the business. Finally, Q4 was a sacred moment for the entire technology industry as we led the 50th anniversary celebration of the Intel 4004, the chip that changed the world. Microprocessor technology sparked by the Intel 4004 allows us to stay connected during the pandemic. It has opened up new ways to work and learn. It has removed geographical boundaries and changed almost every aspect of our lives. We are committed to accelerate this impact for the next 50 years as the insatiable need for compute that started with the 4004 continues to drive the value of Moore's Law. At IEDM, we outlined a long-term path toward more than 10x density improvement in packaging and a 30% to 50% area improvement in transistor scaling. As the steward of Moore's Law, we remain committed to keeping it alive for the next decade and beyond. Looking across the industry, 2021 was dominated by 2 recurring themes, unprecedented demand and ecosystem supply constraints. The strong demand we saw throughout 2021 continued in Q4, and markets remained robust across all our businesses. We expect this trend to continue as the digitization of everything, driven by the 4 superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute and cloud-to-edge infrastructure leads to an era of sustainable growth. 2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry, with third parties reporting a growth rate of approximately 15%, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles and increased market penetration.  In Q4, we also saw the strong recovery in the channel as increased supply led to a record sell-through for Intel, and we started to see inventories return to pre-pandemic levels. The data center market was strong across all geographies in Q4, led by the enterprise where the market continued to recover from COVID lows. We expect the data center, network and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud CapEx investment plans. The ongoing need for data privacy and security drives additional edge and on-prem deployments. 5G network and edge build-outs are scaling and workloads like AI continue to expand. This unprecedented demand continues to be tempered by supply chain constraints as shortages in substrates, components and foundry silicon has limited our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Across the industry, this was most acutely felt in the client market, particularly in notebooks, but constraints have widely impacted other markets, including automotive, the Internet of Things and the data center. As we predicted, these ecosystem constraints are expected to persist through 2022 and into 2023, with incremental improvements over this period. The industry will continue to see challenges in a variety of areas, including specialty and overall foundry shortages, substrates as well as third-party silicon. While constraints will remain, our IDM2.0 strategy affords us a superior position to navigate this environment. With control over our manufacturing network and supply chain, we are able to react to rapid changes in demand that help solve challenges for our customers, suppliers and partners. Equally important as an IDM, we remain more resilient to foundry price increases as only a minority of our volume is produced by third parties. Turning from the ecosystem to Intel. We made incredible progress over the last year improving our execution in technology development, manufacturing and product leadership. With unprecedented transparency, we laid out an ambitious path to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years and regain process performance parity by 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025. We are shipping Intel 7 in volume today. And as I was able to say last quarter and can reaffirm today, we remain on or ahead of schedule for Intel 4, 3, 20A and 18A against the time lines we laid out in July. Our manufacturing execution continued to improve. And in Q4, as we ship a record number of servers and we have more than a 30% year-on-year reduction in 10-nanometer wafer costs, we had record quarterly increase in our substrate capacity with our vendors, and we accelerated our pace of innovation with a record number of PDK releases and new product introductions in our factories. Finally, as part of our strategy to use both internal and external manufacturing, we signed multiple long-term supply agreements ranging from foundry partners to substrates to equipment suppliers that will support the growth of our business for years to come. In particular, we announced the deepening of our ASML partnership and our leadership position with the second generation of EUV High-NA. In client, we had another $10 billion quarter, and 2021 was our 6th straight year of revenue growth. We feel great about our position within the sustainably larger client market, and we had an all-time record shipments with customers like Dell. We have a great product lineup starting with Tiger Lake, which has now shipped over 100 million units, making it the fastest-ramping notebook in our history. We are extending our leadership position further with products like our 12th generation Alder Lake, the fastest client processor ever, which is now shipping to over 140 customers in 30 countries around the world. As our first performance hybrid product, it features the highest-performance CPU core Intel has ever built as well as the efficient cores optimized for power. It leads the industry transition on DDR5 and PCIe 5 to enhance gaming and creator experiences. The Alder Lake family will scale across every PC segment from ultra-thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktops, where we've now set new overclocking records to mobile gaming, where the Core i9-12900HK, the world's best mobile gaming processor, is up to 40% faster than the prior generation. Following on the success of Alder Lake, we will continue to build momentum later this year when we expect to introduce Raptor Lake, which is already booted in our labs. In addition to leadership products, we are also driving platform innovations. And at CES, we unveiled our third-gen EVO platform. This new generation includes features like intelligent collaboration to optimize remote work and learning experiences as well as Thunderbolt 4 and WiFi 6E. With no legacy Wi-Fi interference, WiFi 6E will enable incredible performance with low latency, the biggest WiFi advancement in 20 years. We are further reinvigorating the PC ecosystem with technologies like Screenovate, which provides a seamless multi-device and screen-sharing experience, which will begin rolling out on select Intel Evo platforms starting later this year. Driven by the strong product and platform lineup, we feel confident in our ability to compete and drive growth going forward. Our Data Center Group had its best quarter ever as customers continued rebuilding their confidence in choosing Intel. Enabled by our IDM advantage, Ice Lake servers shipped more than 1 million units, equal to the amount we had shipped in the prior 3 quarters combined. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and all of our major cloud customers have announced instances, including our third instance with Amazon Web Services. Going forward, our road map only gets better, and we expect to ship initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers in Q1. Sapphire Rapids will offer significant performance improvements across a range of workloads, including AI, where we are targeting up to 30x total gain for Xeon. This demonstrates that a general-purpose CPU with built-in AI acceleration can solve even more customer use cases that once necessitated GPU acceleration. Customers remain excited about Sapphire Rapids, and it has been chosen, along with HPE, to power the new Kestrel supercomputer, built for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Kestrel will accelerate discovery of renewable power. Once completed in 2023, Kestrel will have more than 5x greater capability than NREL's existing system with approximately 44 petaflops of peak performance. Beyond the core data center, we continue to build on our leadership position from the network to the edge with our comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software solutions. We are leading the transformation of the network where Xeon and FlexRAN software are used in almost all DRAM commercial deployments. We are driving AI inferencing adoption at the edge with our OpenVINO software and partners like BMW Group and Samsung in the factory and medical environments. And we are extending the IPU ecosystem and accelerating the creation of fully programmable network by collaborating on new FPGA-based IPU solutions with Inspur, Ruijie Networks and Silicom. In our discrete and accelerated graphics business, we are starting the year very quickly. Alchemist, the first product in our Intel Arc Discrete Graphics lineup, is now shipping to customers with more than 50 new mobile and desktop designs, including with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. Our Arc family of products will scale from mainstream up to the performance graphics segment and will be available in the market later this quarter. In high-performance computing, our Ponte Vecchio GPU is already sampling to customers. With 100 billion transistors, Ponte Vecchio has our highest compute density ever and along with Sapphire Rapids will power the 2 exaflop Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. There are over 100 HPC applications running on Ponte Vecchio, which, enabled by 1 API, provides a unified and open programming model across CPU and GPU. We are working with numerous partners and customers, including Atos, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Quanta and Supermicro to deploy our HPC-tuned CPUs and GPUs in their latest systems. Our IFS business continues to see strong and enthusiastic customer support. We have a strong pipeline of potential customers and IP development with the ecosystem is progressing well. We are shipping for revenue on our packaging solutions, and we continue to expect customer test chips in our factories on our Intel 16 process this year. Innovations like RibbonFET and PowerVia are proving to be very attractive features to potential customers, and the Intel 18A design kit has now been released to 3 RAMP-C customers. Overall, we are ahead of where I thought we'd be, and I am thrilled with the progress of our IFS team. In mobility, Mobileye continues to be an industry leader in both ADAS and AV, and we recently hit a significant milestone shipping our 100th million IQ SoC. At CES, we gave a glimpse of the future with the EyeQ Ultra, which will do the work of 10 EyeQ 5 SoCs in a single package and was designed to deliver the optimum power and performance for a fully self-driving vehicle. In Q4, we also introduced our first autonomous on-demand service in Paris in collaboration with the RATP Group. Paris is the latest in a list of locations where Mobileye is piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets, including New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel and China. Looking ahead, we still expect to launch commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022. As we announced in December, we are working to take Mobileye public to unlock shareholder value. We are making good progress, and we'll share more as we go through the year. You'll hear a lot more about how we are rearchitecting our business for growth as part of our upcoming Investor Day. We will lay out details on how we are leveraging our core strengths to accelerate our plans and how we are uniquely positioned to create value. We'll give you the proof points you should expect to see in 2022 that show that we are on track for our long-term plan, all backed up by the transparency and accountability that our new reportable segments will provide. Let me close by saying again that Q4 was an incredibly strong finish to a great 2021. And I believe that, with growing markets, our strong product road map and our increasingly solid execution, 2022 will only be better. In fact, just in the past 24 hours, we were pleased to see the ruling from the General Court in Europe and their decision to overturn the EUR 1.1 billion fine. The semiconductor industry has never been more competitive than it is today, and we look forward to continuing to invest and grow in Europe. At the same time, here in the U.S., we were very excited to see the progress on the CHIPS Act with the House introducing their version of the bill yesterday. The President and other members of the administration have been clear on the importance of this transformational investment, and it's encouraging to see the strong bipartisan and bicameral support as we continue to work together to address the long-term impacts of the semiconductor shortage, restore U.S. leadership in this critical industry and rebalance the global supply chain. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Zinsner: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say how happy I am to be part of Intel. It's a really exciting time, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to support Intel's transformation and plans for growth. I think we have a great opportunity to drive compelling returns and shareholder value, which all starts with the plans that we will lay out for you at Investor Day in February. Q4 was a record quarter, delivering a stronger-than-expected finish to another record year. Both DCG and IOTG achieved record quarters, with CCG, IOTG and Mobileye delivering full year record revenue. Q4 revenue was $19.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected enterprise and government demand in data center, desktop PC strength and better-than-expected notebook demand. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.4%, exceeding our guidance by 190 basis points due to strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.09, $0.19 above our guide due to strong operational performance. For full year 2021, we achieved record revenue of $74.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from our previous guidance and up 2% year-over-year. 2021 gross margin was 57.7%, and EPS was $5.47, up $0.37 year-over-year. We generated $11.3 billion of free cash flow in 2021, approximately $1 billion lower than prior expectations as higher net income was offset by Q4 working capital fluctuations. Now turning to our business units. CCG delivered record annual revenue, its 6th straight year of revenue growth, up 1% year-over-year and up 6% when excluding the modem and connected home divestitures. For the quarter, revenue was $10.1 billion, up 5% sequentially on strong commercial demand. Platform ASPs were up 15% year-over-year on a richer mix, driven by strong demand for our highest-performing platforms and industry-wide constraints leading our customers to prioritize limited components to higher-end systems. Operating profit was down 3% year-over-year on increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. The Data Center Group delivered a record $7.3 billion in revenue for Q4, up 12% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year on strong enterprise and government demand. Full year revenue was down 1% due to a slower-than-expected recovery earlier in the year as well as competitive pressure, partially offset by stronger enterprise and government and communications service provider demand. Platform ASPs were up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year on improved mix to our highest-performing products. Operating profit in Q4 was down 17% year-over-year, primarily due to the previously disclosed Intel Federal-related onetime charge and 10-nanometer product ramp. Full year operating profit was down due to lower revenue, with an increased mix of 10-nanometer products, Intel 4 start-up charges and increased investment in our product road map. IOTG achieved record Q4 and full year revenue. Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year on broad-based strength, led by the industrial and retail segments. Full year revenue was $4 billion, up 33% year-over-year as the business saw a strong recovery from COVID-related impacts. Operating profit for the year was $1 billion, up 110% year-over-year. PSG delivered $484 million in Q4 revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up slightly quarter-over-quarter as industry-wide supply constraints continue to severely limit revenue growth. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Operating profit was $51 million, up 19% year-over-year. If not for the external supply constraints, we believe the PSG business would have delivered over $500 million in additional revenue in 2021. Mobileye reported Q4 revenue of $356 million and $1.4 billion for full year, up 43% year-over-year. Full year operating profit was $460 million, up 91% year-over-year. Before moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI. Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical CCG business plus workstation revenue; Data Center and Artificial Intelligence, which includes our data center CPU products plus our PSG business; Networking and Edge, which includes our IOTG business plus our networking-focused products previously included in DCG; Accelerated Computing and Graphics, which includes all discrete graphics products; Mobileye, which is unchanged from our prior segmentation; and Intel Foundry Services, which includes revenue from our wafer and packaging offerings. This new reporting structure enables transparent accountability relative to how well we are managing and executing against the 6 business units that will be further communicated at Investor Day in February. Moving to our Q1 outlook. We continue to see strong demand across all our businesses, and note that Q1 includes the impact of an additional 14th week. We expect results to be tempered by continued industry-wide component constraints, normal seasonality and PC notebook inventory burn as OEMs work through inventory imbalances created by ecosystem constraints that have limited their ability to ship systems in certain segments. We expect Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 2% when adjusting for an approximately $600 million onetime corporate revenue item recognized in Q1 '21.  As we signaled in our Q3 call, gross margin will be impacted by our 10-nanometer product ramp and increased process technology investments. The aforementioned onetime corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of approximately $0.80 and a tax rate of approximately 15%. Note that we will provide full year 2022 guidance and more details on our long-term financial model as part of our Investor Day on February 17. We hope to see you there in person for a full day of presentations and Q&A sessions with our most senior leaders. Finally, I want to thank George for his 3 years at Intel, delivering outstanding results and making many of the changes necessary to begin our transition to a growth company. And now, let me hand it off to George to say a few words.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Dave. I want to close my final earnings call with sincere thanks to our Intel employees who amaze me every day and for the privilege to have served as your CFO. And I could not be more delighted that Dave is taking over, knowing all the incredible strengths he brings to the role. Thanks all.\nDavid Zinsner: Thanks, George. With that, let me turn the call back over to Tony to get to your questions.\nTony Balow: All right. Thank you, Dave. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would that ask each participant ask only one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Congratulations on the results. Pat, it's great to see a second quarter of year-over-year growth in DCG and an acceleration over the calendar third quarter. But if you look underneath the covers, there's sort of 2 stories at play. Enterprises coming back extremely strong. But if you look at the cloud part of the business, I think this is the 5th consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. And so I guess there's 2 parts to my question. One, when do you see a return to year-over-year growth in cloud? And two, to the extent that the investment community has a bias that everything eventually ends up in the cloud, what is kind of your long-term view of the sustainability of this enterprise demand?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks for the comments on a great finish to a great year. So as we look at the DCG business, we just say we started out behind early in the year digestion. And we've sort of been catching up and building momentum in the cloud piece of that business all year long. And we do see that momentum carrying into next year. So that creates some of the year-on-year quarterly compares that you described. E&G, really a tremendous second half and a really strong Q4 for that business where we have higher market share and have seen just a great environment. What we're hearing from our customers is that the momentum in E&G continues in the next year with very strong backlog positions, and it would have been even stronger had it not been for other supply constraints and match sets that we see. And as you may have heard me talk about before, we don't see everything going to the cloud. We see this balance of on-prem and cloud-based delivery. And cloud continues to grow faster than on-prem, but workloads continue to grow on-prem. Also, we expect to see an acceleration of edge-based -- and I spoke about this at our innovation conference, where the big story as we get out to 2 or 3 years from now is going to be accelerating edge growth. And that's an area that Intel has a very strong position in the edge, very high market share, leadership platforms in 5G in inference and AI. So overall, we expect to see a very balanced across our portfolio. We do see strength to see growth in our cloud business next year, continued sustainability of E&G. But the real story over the next couple of years we see as explosive edge growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Congrats on the strong end of the year. And thank you to George, and congrats to Dave. So with all that out of the way, Pat, I want to talk about the PC market. I know you've been one of the more optimistic folks on that. And the fourth quarter results showed a little bit of evidence as to why you're optimistic. But you also talked about some interesting inventory dynamics in there, where channel inventory was rising. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for this year? Again, not front-running the Analyst Day too much, but the expectations for growth for the year and a little bit more on how you reconcile inventory rising with shortages still persisting?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And 2021 was really good, if not great year, for the PC. And I think most of the forecasts now are coming in estimating about 15% growth last year. As we're seeing IDC, Canalys, modest growth in the market next year. So as you've heard me -- and I think this matches exactly what Sacha said yesterday -- we'll just say a structurally larger market for us for next year and a couple of percent growth in that. So we see that we will be able to have continued growth in our client business. And obviously, with a stronger and stronger product line, we see ourselves in a very good position for our client market share. Now the inventory position is one where we have just been at historically low inventories for an extended period of time, just racing to catch up with demand. And so we would say that some of this is just getting to inventory levels that are even approaching what we consider normal for a business of this size and one that's managing these still significant supply constraints at different areas, power controllers, display led controllers, other aspects of substrates and different component pieces. So a lot of these challenges have really led to, I'll just say, supply issues throughout the customer base. So as we go to next year, we hope to see some of those starting to moderate and turn to a more normal behavior in the industry, in particular, the channel inventory levels, the ones that were essentially zero, right, for almost all of the year. And now we're starting to see just a little bit of build back in that area, which particularly, for our channel and distribution partners, sort of for the first time, giving them something to sell for the whole year. So a lot of response positively there. Overall, we still see that the PC is now becoming this essential part in an increasingly work from home, learn from home environment; Windows 11, a strong upgrade cycle being introduced by that. So a lot of good tailwinds and a great product line. It's going to be a great year for us in the client space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great. I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending a little bit. And again, I don't want to tread on material you're going to cover at the Analyst Day. But the footprint in Ohio, the various comments that you've made about not being able to foresee having too much capacity in the next couple of years, as you think about that, how much of that is your existing x86 business versus foundry and other opportunities? And any sense for the capital spending you felt through this year, how much of that is going to be buildings versus equipment?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Joe. And I'll kick it off and ask Dave to comment as well. Overall, we would just say that supply constraints, we just have a lot of catching up to do in building out the capital footprint. And some of that is catching up. Some of that's building for the new process technologies are 5 of those in 4 years. But it also is leveraging the smart cap strategy that we've laid out, where, boy, I lost for having a free shell today that we could be ramping into. We simply have to build some more shell capacity. And then we'll be determining where is the best use and how to fill that as we start to build out those shelves. Everything that we've described, our Arizona build-out, our Ohio build-out, we do expect that, that will be satisfying both our internal products as well as creating capacity corridors for our foundry business as well. At Analyst Day, we'll be shaping that with more clarity. And Dave will be giving updates on a number of the capital aspects at the foundry -- for foundry as well as for internal capacity there. So Dave, what else might you add?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. First of all, thanks, Pat. And I just did want to say thanks for joining the call, and I'm really happy to be part of Intel. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us, and I couldn't be more excited to be a part of IDM 2.0. I think there's a lot of opportunity to create a lot of shareholder value. In fact, one of the areas we're doing that right now is increasing the dividend 5%. So it's great to -- my first quarter dividend raise\u2026.  On the CapEx -- on the CapEx front, Joe, obviously, as Pat mentioned, we'll give you a lot more granularity in terms of '22 and beyond in terms of CapEx. But if you look back at the 2021 CapEx split, it was roughly 60% equipment, 40% space build-out. So that's at least the ratio last year. Of course, it might evolve over time, but it gives you kind of a rough magnitude of the numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I wanted to dig into your inventory comments again. So I know you're talking -- you're saying you're building inventories, but your PC volumes were down 18% year-over-year. The PC market wasn't down 18% year-over-year. So it doesn't feel like you're building inventory. If anything, it feels like inventory is bleeding out. So for your parts only. So how do we square that circle? What's going on there?\nPat Gelsinger: You want to address that, Dave or George?\nGeorge Davis: Yes. Maybe I'll just comment a little bit on it. When we do a year-over-year comparison, obviously, Q4 of last year was a huge quarter for CCG, particularly with the consumer and entry SKUs. And so what we've seen really starting with the second half, in particular, for 2021, is a rotation out of the consumer and entry area into the, what we call, our big core notebooks and our desktop, which desktop had really dropped off. And now we're seeing kind of a strong recovery there. So we -- if we think a little bit about the growth of CCG year-over-year, we certainly look to be growing lower than the TAM. But if you take into account the fact that we -- you look at our exit of modem and our exit of Home Gateway and the impact that, that had on a year-over-year comparison, that's about 6 points of growth. And then the customer's decision to go vertical on -- a large customer decided to go vertical, that's about another 6 points. So the overall growth, the pattern is a little different because of the mix year-over-year. But the growth relative to the TAM, when you take into account these changes, is much more in line with the overall growth of the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: On Intel Foundry Services, it appears that the team is off to a good start. It looks like a lot of good early engagements. If I'm a potential IFS customer and I start my design today, realistically, right, I'm not expecting my chip design to be ready for manufacturing conservatively for at least 2 years because that's just how long the design cycle times are for these leading-edge chips. And it seems consistent with your prior commentary on IFS customers more focused on your 20 and 18A nodes which is kind of 2024, 2025 timeframe. So if I think about the real big CapEx outlay to support IFS, my assumption is that it's probably not until 2024 or maybe even 2025 timeframe. Is that kind of the right way to think about it that most of the CapEx spend for IFS is probably 2 to 3 years' delay and more of the CapEx spend over the next 2, 3 years is to support growth of the core compute businesses?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Your comments sort of dimensionalize it almost right. The key thing to augment what you said is that to be able to put the capital in place in '24, '25, you have to be building the shelves in '22, '23. So that's what we've -- and why, for instance, the Ohio announcement, we said, hey, we are building shelves so that we can fill it with our products and with foundry customers as well. But clearly, when we get to Intel 3 as well as Intel 18A ramps for foundry customers, those capital investments, most of that being back-end loaded, right, when you're putting equipment in place, really ramp up in '24 and '25. But we've got to start building the shelve capacity for those in '22 and '23. Your other comments, we do expect some of the Intel 16 customers that some of those products will start ramping next year. So we do expect some of those design starts that are already underway today to start giving us some revenues for our foundry offerings on Intel 16 in '23. We would expect Intel 3 to start contributing in '24 and Intel 18A in '25 and beyond. So it's sort of that nice ramp. But we've also said, hey, we already have packaging customers, and those revenues have already started in Q4 of this year. And obviously, some of the services, some of these are paid for services as well. So those will start contributing even before then. But overall, the world wants more capacity. The world is looking for leading-edge foundry capabilities. We've seen very strong interest from many different sectors. And I'll just say, across whether it's leading-edge, high-performance computing, mobile customers, industrial customers and clearly, automotive customers, a very broad swath of customers who are interested in the Intel Foundry Services and great momentum that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and thank you to George and a welcome to Dave. I actually ha a near and longer term question on gross margins. So in the near term, I am wondering the 52%, how does this kind of evolve through the year? I know you're not trying to give a specific number right now. But what are the puts and takes and kind of the key drivers? Is this the floor or ceiling or kind of the average level that we should be thinking about? And then longer-term, Pat, how do we reconcile that your main competitor who is kind of just fabless is pretty much at the same gross margins without having to spend any of the CapEx that Intel plans to spend? When can Intel start using the pricing power in the markets where you have very large incumbency?\nDavid Zinsner: Okay. Let me start, and Pat can certainly provide us color around pricing. So you're right that we are going to provide a lot more details around the year at the Investor Day and give you actually some perspective over the longer term. But I think I can help you think through a little bit about the trend based on the following commentary. So in our third quarter earnings call that Pat and George were representing Intel, we said that we had to make investments, both in terms of newer process technologies and the start-up costs associated with that and we needed to ramp 10-nanometer. And that was going to put pressure on gross margins. And they create -- they presented a range of somewhere between 51% and 53% was the gross margin level that we would need to operate at while we were getting ourselves caught up from a technology perspective. So we're in that range for their guidance, the 52%. And we feel very good about 51% to 53% range for the year. So that's -- so when you look at this number, it can bounce around a little bit. But the 51% to 53% range we've given, we feel real confidence around for the time being. Now after that, as we get back to a leadership position in terms of technology and in terms of products, of course, there's absolutely opportunity to improve upon that. And we will, I think, provide you good evidence of that at the Investor Day in February. So that should give you some incentive to come.\nPat Gelsinger: And a couple of comments on the longer-term margin picture, as we said, leadership products, when we get to process leadership, right, and the nice cadence for those process technologies, those will become nicely accelerants. And we said that we will see our margins recover in the latter part of the 5-year window that we gave guidance on our last earnings call. So we do see those as contributors, and we'll see our margins rise over time as a result. Additionally, we do expect our long-term margins to be a composite of our foundry business, which will be on the lower end of the margin range that we'll operate the company in and combining that characterization of that at the -- at our investor meeting as well. Further, we'd say, over time, we think we have a structurally superior margin model for our business where I think everybody is seeing acute inflation and foundry costs and others in the industry where our factory network will give us a lot more opportunities to create a more balanced cost structure that others in the industry will not be able to accomplish. So overall, we see great margin outlook, great cash flow and free cash flow opportunities over the horizon, and we'll characterize those much more carefully as part of our investor meeting. But we see the advantages of our business model over anybody else in the industry to be quite substantial for supply, for margin creation, for cash flow generation. And all of these will come together in a very powerful way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.\nChristopher Danely: So you're spinning out Mobileye to maximize shareholder value, which I think everybody likes. Have you given any thought or is there any possibility of spinning out Altera to maximize shareholder value as well?\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you for the question. The Mobileye spinout, things are progressing smoothly. We'll give updates on that as appropriate as we go out over time. But -- and as we said, it will be a partial spin, so we still see continuing and substantive value creation for Mobileye having a high relationship with Intel. So we'll be updating on that as things progress there. I won't say that's the last one that we'll consider for such moves. We see this as a formula for value creation that may have other areas that could benefit from such approaches from the Intel family as we look to the future. And we said this is a model for value creation that we think is a powerful one and one that we'll be exercising in the industry, but we have no other specifics to talk about at this time. But keep showing up, we're going to have lots of good things to talk about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Pat, I had a question about how you think about DCG and your server share. And obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to be a lot more competitive. But Gen was also going to be ramping kind of right on top of it. So -- is there kind of a line in the sand that you think of that you won't let share go below X percentage? Can you just talk big picture about how you think about market share in server? Is there a threshold over which you'd use price to get more competitive?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And overall, we do see that the product line is getting more competitive. Sapphire Rapids will be a stronger product. But we're already seeing that the product line is getting more competitive with Ice Lake. And our Q4 numbers on Ice Lake were very good. And we see the Q4 equaled all of the shipments of the first 3 quarters of the year. So Ice Lake is an improvement. Sapphire Rapids gets better. We do expect that there's going to be a bit of to and fro with the competitive alternatives where they'll deliver a product, we'll deliver the next product. And as you've heard me say, we are on a path to sustained unquestioned leadership into this area. It's going to take us a few generations until we're unquestionably in a leadership position, but we believe our product teams, our packaging teams and our process technologies, our factory capacity, all of these give us the tools to create leadership products. And then we combine that with our platform leadership and our software technologies, we have a path to unquestioned leadership over time. Obviously, we believe we're going to have a superior cost structure, as we've already touched on, given that many of our server products come from our factories. So we're going to be in a better margin and cost position and capacity we think we have a lot of tools to address market share over time. And we're going to dimensionalize the business a bit more as part of our Analyst Day coming up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay: Just following up on the Data Center Group. The revenue very strong, but the operating margin, I think, was down 10 points year-over-year. And I wanted to dig into that a little bit. The slides and the release mentioned an Intel Federal charge, if you guys could quantify that. But the bigger part of the question is now with the Ice Lake ramp, there's a lot more volume in DCG that's going on to the 10-nanometer node. And my question, Pat, is do we need to evolve the product set to where we get to Granite Rapids and we get off of 10-nanometer before we see margin improvement in DCG? Or is there going to Sapphire Rapids in a tiled approach with smaller tiles while still on 10? Is that enough for the margins to recover?\nPat Gelsinger: Do you want to start that, Dave?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, I'll start. Yes. So I mean, just in the strict walk of the operating margins of the DCG business. So it's -- some of the things I talked about in terms of the aggregate story around gross margins, there's the ramp of 10-nanometer for the data center space. There's higher start-up costs associated with new process technologies, so that's certainly driving it. We also had a onetime charge in our E&G business for a Federal charge that also negatively impacted the operating margins. And then lastly, as we talked about, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in terms of product technology in R&D. And so we had some increased OpEx investment that also drove it. But all of this is kind of executing to the plan that Pat laid out a quarter or so ago. And so this is all part of where we wanted to be at this point to drive the future of the company.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I'd say, over time, we absolutely expect that we're going to improve the operating margin of this business again. And we haven't ramped the new node for 5 years in our data center business. And that's something that -- it's an embarrassing thing to say on the one hand. And obviously, as a result, we've been in an area that we shouldn't have had operating margins that high in this business. It's just been that we've been running on very mature nodes well past the time that a normal cycle should be. And now we're aggressively ramping 10. We're also starting to ramp the cost of 7 and 4 as well. So all of these taken together, I think, you're seeing a very unusual period in the gross margins and operating margins of this business. We fully expect that this is a very healthy business for us long term. And as we're going through the cycle of new process technologies, investments in the business, nothing here is surprising to us. And you can expect that over the long term this is a great business for Intel as we ramp leadership process technologies with unquestioned leadership products, we're going to do well here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Dave, a question on gross margins, actually a clarification. If I take your, I guess, the fourth then add back the Federal charge, and then you're guiding to 52% for Q1, that's roughly 5 to 6 points of drop. So I'm just wondering what are some of the puts and takes that impacting, if there are any -- I mean I see the headwinds that you talked about, but I'm wondering if there are any tailwinds or mix-related impacts as well.\nDavid Zinsner: Sure. So definitely, the Federal charge not repeating itself in the first quarter is certainly helpful. And there are a couple of mix benefits that we're seeing. But the charges associated with ramping 10-nanometer, particularly in the data center space, and the start-up costs on Intel 4 are predominantly what's driving the reduced gross margins. But again, it's exactly where we thought we would be in the first fiscal quarter. I mean this is the number that we were planning to drive the business to. And ultimately, the ROI on all the investments we're making that that drive headwinds in the gross margins for the first quarter will turn around and drive a very good ROI down the road.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Pat, I just wanted to check in on the expansion plans that you have. How much of that is dependent on the CHIPS Act passing and also from other incentives? And I asked that because I was listening to your presentation, I guess, earlier in the week at the Ohio site. And you did make a comment there urging attendees to make sure that they weigh into the standard they can to get the act passed. So I just was wondering how much of that of the expansion plans are dependent on the act here as well as in Europe, some government incentives.\nPat Gelsinger: Well, thank you for that question. It's one I hoped would be raised in the call. So thank you for that. And I'll just say overall, I mean, it was just a fabulous day in Ohio, right? The enthusiasm we've gotten. And as I said at the event, we're -- we help put silicon into Silicon Valley. We established the Silicon Forest in Oregon, the Silicon Desert in Arizona and now the Silicon Heartland. And the enthusiasm we've gotten from the leadership there, the governor, the congressional leaders and being able for this farm kit from Pennsylvania to stand on stage in the White House and say now it's my pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, just surreal. So just a fabulous day for Intel, our nation and our industry. Obviously, with the CHIPS Act going on the floor of the House, we're highly encouraged. And I spoke to Speaker Pelosi at length on this subject just yesterday as there you expect it will be debated on the floor next week. And hopefully, following what we expect will be passage in the House, a reconciliation process. So I'd say everybody is now more optimistic on this coming across the line in the near future.  Now obviously, I think we and others have viewed the passage of this as an accelerant for our investment plans. And as I've said very clearly, hey, we're going to build a site in Ohio. It could either be small or it could be big and fast. And with the passage of the CHIPS Act, it's going to be bigger, and we're going to build it out faster as a result. And we think that's good for our company. Even more important, it's good for our nation as we rebuild a resilient, globally balanced supply chain. And the events of just yesterday, getting the bill on the House floor, I think, is a very, very good sign for all that will get us across the line. But even more so, right, we see acts in Europe that are gaining momentum as well in the EU CHIPS Act as well. And we've been quite involved in that domain, and we hope to see our expansion plans accelerate in Europe as well. So overall, all of these things will simply benefit the industry, but it certainly will accelerate our investment plans as it makes us more competitive globally to be for our products, but even more so for our foundry business as well. So thank you for that question.\nPat Gelsinger: And with that, let me, again -- I do want to say thank you to Dave joining us for the first time. George, thank you again for your support, for the years that you've contributed in this critical period of the company. And I do want to remind you of the strategies. We're going to build the team, improve the execution. As we look back on 2021, we've made tremendous progress across all areas that we've laid out. We still do have a lot of work to do, but we're focused, energized and momentum is building. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue on this amazing journey. And Investor Day is coming up. We are going to lay out the strategy. We've got a lot to say. And this is a great business. We finished a great year. Thank you all for joining us today.\nTony Balow: Thank you, Pat. Thank you, Dave and George. Operator, can you please close the call?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say welcome to Dave, who is joining us for his first earnings call. Many of you know Dave well and know his track record of successfully driving shareholder value. We're very excited to have him join our team. I also want to take a moment to thank George for his many contributions during the critical period in the company's transformation. Everyone here at Intel wishes him all the best in his future endeavors as he begins his planned retirement in May. Q4 was a tremendous finish to a transformational year where we beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. We exceeded our guidance for the quarter by over $1 billion on the top line, finishing with our best quarter and our best full year revenue ever. We had a record quarter for DCG, where we grew 20% year-on-year and where we continue to be the partner of choice for cloud and data center customers. We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021. We had a record year for our client business. And in Q4, we outperformed our plan and delivered another $10 billion quarter, highlighting again that the PC is more essential than ever. Continuing our momentum as the market leader in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye grew more than 40% year-on-year in 2021, delivering a 14th consecutive year of revenue growth. And finally, IOTG had another $1 billion quarter to cap a record year as the need for compute at the edge continues to grow. Supporting these record results, our manufacturing network continued its superb execution throughout the year. As an IDM, we were able to rapidly adjust to support customers' mix changes, often with a normal lead time, and manufactured more than 2 million wafers. We broke ground on 2 new fabs in Arizona 3 months ahead of schedule as part of the largest overall manufacturing expansion in Intel's history and all while managing a challenging COVID environment and focusing on the safety of our employees, suppliers and partners. We also took several in a series of key steps to shape our business. To begin with, we've recently completed the first close of the sale of our NAND business on time, a critical step in optimizing our portfolio in line with our new strategy. Second, we began unfolding our plan to find innovative ways to sustainably unlock shareholder value with the announcement of our intent to take Mobileye public in 2022.  Third, just last week, we announced our new manufacturing site in Ohio, which will support our future growth and advances our plan to create a more geographically balanced, resilient supply chain. While there is a lot left to do, we're building momentum, and we intend to continue our laser focus on execution, innovation and growing the business. Finally, Q4 was a sacred moment for the entire technology industry as we led the 50th anniversary celebration of the Intel 4004, the chip that changed the world. Microprocessor technology sparked by the Intel 4004 allows us to stay connected during the pandemic. It has opened up new ways to work and learn. It has removed geographical boundaries and changed almost every aspect of our lives. We are committed to accelerate this impact for the next 50 years as the insatiable need for compute that started with the 4004 continues to drive the value of Moore's Law. At IEDM, we outlined a long-term path toward more than 10x density improvement in packaging and a 30% to 50% area improvement in transistor scaling. As the steward of Moore's Law, we remain committed to keeping it alive for the next decade and beyond. Looking across the industry, 2021 was dominated by 2 recurring themes, unprecedented demand and ecosystem supply constraints. The strong demand we saw throughout 2021 continued in Q4, and markets remained robust across all our businesses. We expect this trend to continue as the digitization of everything, driven by the 4 superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute and cloud-to-edge infrastructure leads to an era of sustainable growth. 2021 marked the best year in a decade for the PC industry, with third parties reporting a growth rate of approximately 15%, driven by higher PC density, shorter replacement cycles and increased market penetration.  In Q4, we also saw the strong recovery in the channel as increased supply led to a record sell-through for Intel, and we started to see inventories return to pre-pandemic levels. The data center market was strong across all geographies in Q4, led by the enterprise where the market continued to recover from COVID lows. We expect the data center, network and edge markets to continue to have robust growth as hyperscalers lay out multiyear cloud CapEx investment plans. The ongoing need for data privacy and security drives additional edge and on-prem deployments. 5G network and edge build-outs are scaling and workloads like AI continue to expand. This unprecedented demand continues to be tempered by supply chain constraints as shortages in substrates, components and foundry silicon has limited our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Across the industry, this was most acutely felt in the client market, particularly in notebooks, but constraints have widely impacted other markets, including automotive, the Internet of Things and the data center. As we predicted, these ecosystem constraints are expected to persist through 2022 and into 2023, with incremental improvements over this period. The industry will continue to see challenges in a variety of areas, including specialty and overall foundry shortages, substrates as well as third-party silicon. While constraints will remain, our IDM2.0 strategy affords us a superior position to navigate this environment. With control over our manufacturing network and supply chain, we are able to react to rapid changes in demand that help solve challenges for our customers, suppliers and partners. Equally important as an IDM, we remain more resilient to foundry price increases as only a minority of our volume is produced by third parties. Turning from the ecosystem to Intel. We made incredible progress over the last year improving our execution in technology development, manufacturing and product leadership. With unprecedented transparency, we laid out an ambitious path to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years and regain process performance parity by 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025. We are shipping Intel 7 in volume today. And as I was able to say last quarter and can reaffirm today, we remain on or ahead of schedule for Intel 4, 3, 20A and 18A against the time lines we laid out in July. Our manufacturing execution continued to improve. And in Q4, as we ship a record number of servers and we have more than a 30% year-on-year reduction in 10-nanometer wafer costs, we had record quarterly increase in our substrate capacity with our vendors, and we accelerated our pace of innovation with a record number of PDK releases and new product introductions in our factories. Finally, as part of our strategy to use both internal and external manufacturing, we signed multiple long-term supply agreements ranging from foundry partners to substrates to equipment suppliers that will support the growth of our business for years to come. In particular, we announced the deepening of our ASML partnership and our leadership position with the second generation of EUV High-NA. In client, we had another $10 billion quarter, and 2021 was our 6th straight year of revenue growth. We feel great about our position within the sustainably larger client market, and we had an all-time record shipments with customers like Dell. We have a great product lineup starting with Tiger Lake, which has now shipped over 100 million units, making it the fastest-ramping notebook in our history. We are extending our leadership position further with products like our 12th generation Alder Lake, the fastest client processor ever, which is now shipping to over 140 customers in 30 countries around the world. As our first performance hybrid product, it features the highest-performance CPU core Intel has ever built as well as the efficient cores optimized for power. It leads the industry transition on DDR5 and PCIe 5 to enhance gaming and creator experiences. The Alder Lake family will scale across every PC segment from ultra-thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktops, where we've now set new overclocking records to mobile gaming, where the Core i9-12900HK, the world's best mobile gaming processor, is up to 40% faster than the prior generation. Following on the success of Alder Lake, we will continue to build momentum later this year when we expect to introduce Raptor Lake, which is already booted in our labs. In addition to leadership products, we are also driving platform innovations. And at CES, we unveiled our third-gen EVO platform. This new generation includes features like intelligent collaboration to optimize remote work and learning experiences as well as Thunderbolt 4 and WiFi 6E. With no legacy Wi-Fi interference, WiFi 6E will enable incredible performance with low latency, the biggest WiFi advancement in 20 years. We are further reinvigorating the PC ecosystem with technologies like Screenovate, which provides a seamless multi-device and screen-sharing experience, which will begin rolling out on select Intel Evo platforms starting later this year. Driven by the strong product and platform lineup, we feel confident in our ability to compete and drive growth going forward. Our Data Center Group had its best quarter ever as customers continued rebuilding their confidence in choosing Intel. Enabled by our IDM advantage, Ice Lake servers shipped more than 1 million units, equal to the amount we had shipped in the prior 3 quarters combined. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and all of our major cloud customers have announced instances, including our third instance with Amazon Web Services. Going forward, our road map only gets better, and we expect to ship initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers in Q1. Sapphire Rapids will offer significant performance improvements across a range of workloads, including AI, where we are targeting up to 30x total gain for Xeon. This demonstrates that a general-purpose CPU with built-in AI acceleration can solve even more customer use cases that once necessitated GPU acceleration. Customers remain excited about Sapphire Rapids, and it has been chosen, along with HPE, to power the new Kestrel supercomputer, built for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Kestrel will accelerate discovery of renewable power. Once completed in 2023, Kestrel will have more than 5x greater capability than NREL's existing system with approximately 44 petaflops of peak performance. Beyond the core data center, we continue to build on our leadership position from the network to the edge with our comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software solutions. We are leading the transformation of the network where Xeon and FlexRAN software are used in almost all DRAM commercial deployments. We are driving AI inferencing adoption at the edge with our OpenVINO software and partners like BMW Group and Samsung in the factory and medical environments. And we are extending the IPU ecosystem and accelerating the creation of fully programmable network by collaborating on new FPGA-based IPU solutions with Inspur, Ruijie Networks and Silicom. In our discrete and accelerated graphics business, we are starting the year very quickly. Alchemist, the first product in our Intel Arc Discrete Graphics lineup, is now shipping to customers with more than 50 new mobile and desktop designs, including with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. Our Arc family of products will scale from mainstream up to the performance graphics segment and will be available in the market later this quarter. In high-performance computing, our Ponte Vecchio GPU is already sampling to customers. With 100 billion transistors, Ponte Vecchio has our highest compute density ever and along with Sapphire Rapids will power the 2 exaflop Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. There are over 100 HPC applications running on Ponte Vecchio, which, enabled by 1 API, provides a unified and open programming model across CPU and GPU. We are working with numerous partners and customers, including Atos, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Quanta and Supermicro to deploy our HPC-tuned CPUs and GPUs in their latest systems. Our IFS business continues to see strong and enthusiastic customer support. We have a strong pipeline of potential customers and IP development with the ecosystem is progressing well. We are shipping for revenue on our packaging solutions, and we continue to expect customer test chips in our factories on our Intel 16 process this year. Innovations like RibbonFET and PowerVia are proving to be very attractive features to potential customers, and the Intel 18A design kit has now been released to 3 RAMP-C customers. Overall, we are ahead of where I thought we'd be, and I am thrilled with the progress of our IFS team. In mobility, Mobileye continues to be an industry leader in both ADAS and AV, and we recently hit a significant milestone shipping our 100th million IQ SoC. At CES, we gave a glimpse of the future with the EyeQ Ultra, which will do the work of 10 EyeQ 5 SoCs in a single package and was designed to deliver the optimum power and performance for a fully self-driving vehicle. In Q4, we also introduced our first autonomous on-demand service in Paris in collaboration with the RATP Group. Paris is the latest in a list of locations where Mobileye is piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets, including New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel and China. Looking ahead, we still expect to launch commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022. As we announced in December, we are working to take Mobileye public to unlock shareholder value. We are making good progress, and we'll share more as we go through the year. You'll hear a lot more about how we are rearchitecting our business for growth as part of our upcoming Investor Day. We will lay out details on how we are leveraging our core strengths to accelerate our plans and how we are uniquely positioned to create value. We'll give you the proof points you should expect to see in 2022 that show that we are on track for our long-term plan, all backed up by the transparency and accountability that our new reportable segments will provide. Let me close by saying again that Q4 was an incredibly strong finish to a great 2021. And I believe that, with growing markets, our strong product road map and our increasingly solid execution, 2022 will only be better. In fact, just in the past 24 hours, we were pleased to see the ruling from the General Court in Europe and their decision to overturn the EUR 1.1 billion fine. The semiconductor industry has never been more competitive than it is today, and we look forward to continuing to invest and grow in Europe. At the same time, here in the U.S., we were very excited to see the progress on the CHIPS Act with the House introducing their version of the bill yesterday. The President and other members of the administration have been clear on the importance of this transformational investment, and it's encouraging to see the strong bipartisan and bicameral support as we continue to work together to address the long-term impacts of the semiconductor shortage, restore U.S. leadership in this critical industry and rebalance the global supply chain. With that, let me turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks for the comments on a great finish to a great year. So as we look at the DCG business, we just say we started out behind early in the year digestion. And we've sort of been catching up and building momentum in the cloud piece of that business all year long. And we do see that momentum carrying into next year. So that creates some of the year-on-year quarterly compares that you described. E&G, really a tremendous second half and a really strong Q4 for that business where we have higher market share and have seen just a great environment. What we're hearing from our customers is that the momentum in E&G continues in the next year with very strong backlog positions, and it would have been even stronger had it not been for other supply constraints and match sets that we see. And as you may have heard me talk about before, we don't see everything going to the cloud. We see this balance of on-prem and cloud-based delivery. And cloud continues to grow faster than on-prem, but workloads continue to grow on-prem. Also, we expect to see an acceleration of edge-based -- and I spoke about this at our innovation conference, where the big story as we get out to 2 or 3 years from now is going to be accelerating edge growth. And that's an area that Intel has a very strong position in the edge, very high market share, leadership platforms in 5G in inference and AI. So overall, we expect to see a very balanced across our portfolio. We do see strength to see growth in our cloud business next year, continued sustainability of E&G. But the real story over the next couple of years we see as explosive edge growth. Yes. Thank you. And 2021 was really good, if not great year, for the PC. And I think most of the forecasts now are coming in estimating about 15% growth last year. As we're seeing IDC, Canalys, modest growth in the market next year. So as you've heard me -- and I think this matches exactly what Sacha said yesterday -- we'll just say a structurally larger market for us for next year and a couple of percent growth in that. So we see that we will be able to have continued growth in our client business. And obviously, with a stronger and stronger product line, we see ourselves in a very good position for our client market share. Now the inventory position is one where we have just been at historically low inventories for an extended period of time, just racing to catch up with demand. And so we would say that some of this is just getting to inventory levels that are even approaching what we consider normal for a business of this size and one that's managing these still significant supply constraints at different areas, power controllers, display led controllers, other aspects of substrates and different component pieces. So a lot of these challenges have really led to, I'll just say, supply issues throughout the customer base. So as we go to next year, we hope to see some of those starting to moderate and turn to a more normal behavior in the industry, in particular, the channel inventory levels, the ones that were essentially zero, right, for almost all of the year. And now we're starting to see just a little bit of build back in that area, which particularly, for our channel and distribution partners, sort of for the first time, giving them something to sell for the whole year. So a lot of response positively there. Overall, we still see that the PC is now becoming this essential part in an increasingly work from home, learn from home environment; Windows 11, a strong upgrade cycle being introduced by that. So a lot of good tailwinds and a great product line. It's going to be a great year for us in the client space. Yes. Thanks, Joe. And I'll kick it off and ask Dave to comment as well. Overall, we would just say that supply constraints, we just have a lot of catching up to do in building out the capital footprint. And some of that is catching up. Some of that's building for the new process technologies are 5 of those in 4 years. But it also is leveraging the smart cap strategy that we've laid out, where, boy, I lost for having a free shell today that we could be ramping into. We simply have to build some more shell capacity. And then we'll be determining where is the best use and how to fill that as we start to build out those shelves. Everything that we've described, our Arizona build-out, our Ohio build-out, we do expect that, that will be satisfying both our internal products as well as creating capacity corridors for our foundry business as well. At Analyst Day, we'll be shaping that with more clarity. And Dave will be giving updates on a number of the capital aspects at the foundry -- for foundry as well as for internal capacity there. So Dave, what else might you add? You want to address that, Dave or George? Yes. Your comments sort of dimensionalize it almost right. The key thing to augment what you said is that to be able to put the capital in place in '24, '25, you have to be building the shelves in '22, '23. So that's what we've -- and why, for instance, the Ohio announcement, we said, hey, we are building shelves so that we can fill it with our products and with foundry customers as well. But clearly, when we get to Intel 3 as well as Intel 18A ramps for foundry customers, those capital investments, most of that being back-end loaded, right, when you're putting equipment in place, really ramp up in '24 and '25. But we've got to start building the shelve capacity for those in '22 and '23. Your other comments, we do expect some of the Intel 16 customers that some of those products will start ramping next year. So we do expect some of those design starts that are already underway today to start giving us some revenues for our foundry offerings on Intel 16 in '23. We would expect Intel 3 to start contributing in '24 and Intel 18A in '25 and beyond. So it's sort of that nice ramp. But we've also said, hey, we already have packaging customers, and those revenues have already started in Q4 of this year. And obviously, some of the services, some of these are paid for services as well. So those will start contributing even before then. But overall, the world wants more capacity. The world is looking for leading-edge foundry capabilities. We've seen very strong interest from many different sectors. And I'll just say, across whether it's leading-edge, high-performance computing, mobile customers, industrial customers and clearly, automotive customers, a very broad swath of customers who are interested in the Intel Foundry Services and great momentum that we're seeing. And a couple of comments on the longer-term margin picture, as we said, leadership products, when we get to process leadership, right, and the nice cadence for those process technologies, those will become nicely accelerants. And we said that we will see our margins recover in the latter part of the 5-year window that we gave guidance on our last earnings call. So we do see those as contributors, and we'll see our margins rise over time as a result. Additionally, we do expect our long-term margins to be a composite of our foundry business, which will be on the lower end of the margin range that we'll operate the company in and combining that characterization of that at the -- at our investor meeting as well. Further, we'd say, over time, we think we have a structurally superior margin model for our business where I think everybody is seeing acute inflation and foundry costs and others in the industry where our factory network will give us a lot more opportunities to create a more balanced cost structure that others in the industry will not be able to accomplish. So overall, we see great margin outlook, great cash flow and free cash flow opportunities over the horizon, and we'll characterize those much more carefully as part of our investor meeting. But we see the advantages of our business model over anybody else in the industry to be quite substantial for supply, for margin creation, for cash flow generation. And all of these will come together in a very powerful way. Thank you for the question. The Mobileye spinout, things are progressing smoothly. We'll give updates on that as appropriate as we go out over time. But -- and as we said, it will be a partial spin, so we still see continuing and substantive value creation for Mobileye having a high relationship with Intel. So we'll be updating on that as things progress there. I won't say that's the last one that we'll consider for such moves. We see this as a formula for value creation that may have other areas that could benefit from such approaches from the Intel family as we look to the future. And we said this is a model for value creation that we think is a powerful one and one that we'll be exercising in the industry, but we have no other specifics to talk about at this time. But keep showing up, we're going to have lots of good things to talk about. Yes. Thank you. And overall, we do see that the product line is getting more competitive. Sapphire Rapids will be a stronger product. But we're already seeing that the product line is getting more competitive with Ice Lake. And our Q4 numbers on Ice Lake were very good. And we see the Q4 equaled all of the shipments of the first 3 quarters of the year. So Ice Lake is an improvement. Sapphire Rapids gets better. We do expect that there's going to be a bit of to and fro with the competitive alternatives where they'll deliver a product, we'll deliver the next product. And as you've heard me say, we are on a path to sustained unquestioned leadership into this area. It's going to take us a few generations until we're unquestionably in a leadership position, but we believe our product teams, our packaging teams and our process technologies, our factory capacity, all of these give us the tools to create leadership products. And then we combine that with our platform leadership and our software technologies, we have a path to unquestioned leadership over time. Obviously, we believe we're going to have a superior cost structure, as we've already touched on, given that many of our server products come from our factories. So we're going to be in a better margin and cost position and capacity we think we have a lot of tools to address market share over time. And we're going to dimensionalize the business a bit more as part of our Analyst Day coming up. Do you want to start that, Dave? Yes. And I'd say, over time, we absolutely expect that we're going to improve the operating margin of this business again. And we haven't ramped the new node for 5 years in our data center business. And that's something that -- it's an embarrassing thing to say on the one hand. And obviously, as a result, we've been in an area that we shouldn't have had operating margins that high in this business. It's just been that we've been running on very mature nodes well past the time that a normal cycle should be. And now we're aggressively ramping 10. We're also starting to ramp the cost of 7 and 4 as well. So all of these taken together, I think, you're seeing a very unusual period in the gross margins and operating margins of this business. We fully expect that this is a very healthy business for us long term. And as we're going through the cycle of new process technologies, investments in the business, nothing here is surprising to us. And you can expect that over the long term this is a great business for Intel as we ramp leadership process technologies with unquestioned leadership products, we're going to do well here. Well, thank you for that question. It's one I hoped would be raised in the call. So thank you for that. And I'll just say overall, I mean, it was just a fabulous day in Ohio, right? The enthusiasm we've gotten. And as I said at the event, we're -- we help put silicon into Silicon Valley. We established the Silicon Forest in Oregon, the Silicon Desert in Arizona and now the Silicon Heartland. And the enthusiasm we've gotten from the leadership there, the governor, the congressional leaders and being able for this farm kit from Pennsylvania to stand on stage in the White House and say now it's my pleasure to introduce the President of the United States of America, just surreal. So just a fabulous day for Intel, our nation and our industry. Obviously, with the CHIPS Act going on the floor of the House, we're highly encouraged. And I spoke to Speaker Pelosi at length on this subject just yesterday as there you expect it will be debated on the floor next week. And hopefully, following what we expect will be passage in the House, a reconciliation process. So I'd say everybody is now more optimistic on this coming across the line in the near future.  Now obviously, I think we and others have viewed the passage of this as an accelerant for our investment plans. And as I've said very clearly, hey, we're going to build a site in Ohio. It could either be small or it could be big and fast. And with the passage of the CHIPS Act, it's going to be bigger, and we're going to build it out faster as a result. And we think that's good for our company. Even more important, it's good for our nation as we rebuild a resilient, globally balanced supply chain. And the events of just yesterday, getting the bill on the House floor, I think, is a very, very good sign for all that will get us across the line. But even more so, right, we see acts in Europe that are gaining momentum as well in the EU CHIPS Act as well. And we've been quite involved in that domain, and we hope to see our expansion plans accelerate in Europe as well. So overall, all of these things will simply benefit the industry, but it certainly will accelerate our investment plans as it makes us more competitive globally to be for our products, but even more so for our foundry business as well. So thank you for that question. And with that, let me, again -- I do want to say thank you to Dave joining us for the first time. George, thank you again for your support, for the years that you've contributed in this critical period of the company. And I do want to remind you of the strategies. We're going to build the team, improve the execution. As we look back on 2021, we've made tremendous progress across all areas that we've laid out. We still do have a lot of work to do, but we're focused, energized and momentum is building. And I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we continue on this amazing journey. And Investor Day is coming up. We are going to lay out the strategy. We've got a lot to say. And this is a great business. We finished a great year. Thank you all for joining us today."

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. I want to close my final earnings call with sincere thanks to our Intel employees who amaze me every day and for the privilege to have served as your CFO. And I could not be more delighted that Dave is taking over, knowing all the incredible strengths he brings to the role. Thanks all. Yes. Maybe I'll just comment a little bit on it. When we do a year-over-year comparison, obviously, Q4 of last year was a huge quarter for CCG, particularly with the consumer and entry SKUs. And so what we've seen really starting with the second half, in particular, for 2021, is a rotation out of the consumer and entry area into the, what we call, our big core notebooks and our desktop, which desktop had really dropped off. And now we're seeing kind of a strong recovery there. So we -- if we think a little bit about the growth of CCG year-over-year, we certainly look to be growing lower than the TAM. But if you take into account the fact that we -- you look at our exit of modem and our exit of Home Gateway and the impact that, that had on a year-over-year comparison, that's about 6 points of growth. And then the customer's decision to go vertical on -- a large customer decided to go vertical, that's about another 6 points. So the overall growth, the pattern is a little different because of the mix year-over-year. But the growth relative to the TAM, when you take into account these changes, is much more in line with the overall growth of the industry."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me say how happy I am to be part of Intel. It's a really exciting time, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to support Intel's transformation and plans for growth. I think we have a great opportunity to drive compelling returns and shareholder value, which all starts with the plans that we will lay out for you at Investor Day in February. Q4 was a record quarter, delivering a stronger-than-expected finish to another record year. Both DCG and IOTG achieved record quarters, with CCG, IOTG and Mobileye delivering full year record revenue. Q4 revenue was $19.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected enterprise and government demand in data center, desktop PC strength and better-than-expected notebook demand. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.4%, exceeding our guidance by 190 basis points due to strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.09, $0.19 above our guide due to strong operational performance. For full year 2021, we achieved record revenue of $74.7 billion, up $1.2 billion from our previous guidance and up 2% year-over-year. 2021 gross margin was 57.7%, and EPS was $5.47, up $0.37 year-over-year. We generated $11.3 billion of free cash flow in 2021, approximately $1 billion lower than prior expectations as higher net income was offset by Q4 working capital fluctuations. Now turning to our business units. CCG delivered record annual revenue, its 6th straight year of revenue growth, up 1% year-over-year and up 6% when excluding the modem and connected home divestitures. For the quarter, revenue was $10.1 billion, up 5% sequentially on strong commercial demand. Platform ASPs were up 15% year-over-year on a richer mix, driven by strong demand for our highest-performing platforms and industry-wide constraints leading our customers to prioritize limited components to higher-end systems. Operating profit was down 3% year-over-year on increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. The Data Center Group delivered a record $7.3 billion in revenue for Q4, up 12% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year on strong enterprise and government demand. Full year revenue was down 1% due to a slower-than-expected recovery earlier in the year as well as competitive pressure, partially offset by stronger enterprise and government and communications service provider demand. Platform ASPs were up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year on improved mix to our highest-performing products. Operating profit in Q4 was down 17% year-over-year, primarily due to the previously disclosed Intel Federal-related onetime charge and 10-nanometer product ramp. Full year operating profit was down due to lower revenue, with an increased mix of 10-nanometer products, Intel 4 start-up charges and increased investment in our product road map. IOTG achieved record Q4 and full year revenue. Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year on broad-based strength, led by the industrial and retail segments. Full year revenue was $4 billion, up 33% year-over-year as the business saw a strong recovery from COVID-related impacts. Operating profit for the year was $1 billion, up 110% year-over-year. PSG delivered $484 million in Q4 revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up slightly quarter-over-quarter as industry-wide supply constraints continue to severely limit revenue growth. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Operating profit was $51 million, up 19% year-over-year. If not for the external supply constraints, we believe the PSG business would have delivered over $500 million in additional revenue in 2021. Mobileye reported Q4 revenue of $356 million and $1.4 billion for full year, up 43% year-over-year. Full year operating profit was $460 million, up 91% year-over-year. Before moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI. Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical CCG business plus workstation revenue; Data Center and Artificial Intelligence, which includes our data center CPU products plus our PSG business; Networking and Edge, which includes our IOTG business plus our networking-focused products previously included in DCG; Accelerated Computing and Graphics, which includes all discrete graphics products; Mobileye, which is unchanged from our prior segmentation; and Intel Foundry Services, which includes revenue from our wafer and packaging offerings. This new reporting structure enables transparent accountability relative to how well we are managing and executing against the 6 business units that will be further communicated at Investor Day in February. Moving to our Q1 outlook. We continue to see strong demand across all our businesses, and note that Q1 includes the impact of an additional 14th week. We expect results to be tempered by continued industry-wide component constraints, normal seasonality and PC notebook inventory burn as OEMs work through inventory imbalances created by ecosystem constraints that have limited their ability to ship systems in certain segments. We expect Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 2% when adjusting for an approximately $600 million onetime corporate revenue item recognized in Q1 '21.  As we signaled in our Q3 call, gross margin will be impacted by our 10-nanometer product ramp and increased process technology investments. The aforementioned onetime corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of approximately $0.80 and a tax rate of approximately 15%. Note that we will provide full year 2022 guidance and more details on our long-term financial model as part of our Investor Day on February 17. We hope to see you there in person for a full day of presentations and Q&A sessions with our most senior leaders. Finally, I want to thank George for his 3 years at Intel, delivering outstanding results and making many of the changes necessary to begin our transition to a growth company. And now, let me hand it off to George to say a few words. Thanks, George. With that, let me turn the call back over to Tony to get to your questions. Yes. First of all, thanks, Pat. And I just did want to say thanks for joining the call, and I'm really happy to be part of Intel. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us, and I couldn't be more excited to be a part of IDM 2.0. I think there's a lot of opportunity to create a lot of shareholder value. In fact, one of the areas we're doing that right now is increasing the dividend 5%. So it's great to -- my first quarter dividend raise....  On the CapEx -- on the CapEx front, Joe, obviously, as Pat mentioned, we'll give you a lot more granularity in terms of '22 and beyond in terms of CapEx. But if you look back at the 2021 CapEx split, it was roughly 60% equipment, 40% space build-out. So that's at least the ratio last year. Of course, it might evolve over time, but it gives you kind of a rough magnitude of the numbers. Okay. Let me start, and Pat can certainly provide us color around pricing. So you're right that we are going to provide a lot more details around the year at the Investor Day and give you actually some perspective over the longer term. But I think I can help you think through a little bit about the trend based on the following commentary. So in our third quarter earnings call that Pat and George were representing Intel, we said that we had to make investments, both in terms of newer process technologies and the start-up costs associated with that and we needed to ramp 10-nanometer. And that was going to put pressure on gross margins. And they create -- they presented a range of somewhere between 51% and 53% was the gross margin level that we would need to operate at while we were getting ourselves caught up from a technology perspective. So we're in that range for their guidance, the 52%. And we feel very good about 51% to 53% range for the year. So that's -- so when you look at this number, it can bounce around a little bit. But the 51% to 53% range we've given, we feel real confidence around for the time being. Now after that, as we get back to a leadership position in terms of technology and in terms of products, of course, there's absolutely opportunity to improve upon that. And we will, I think, provide you good evidence of that at the Investor Day in February. So that should give you some incentive to come. Yes, I'll start. Yes. So I mean, just in the strict walk of the operating margins of the DCG business. So it's -- some of the things I talked about in terms of the aggregate story around gross margins, there's the ramp of 10-nanometer for the data center space. There's higher start-up costs associated with new process technologies, so that's certainly driving it. We also had a onetime charge in our E&G business for a Federal charge that also negatively impacted the operating margins. And then lastly, as we talked about, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in terms of product technology in R&D. And so we had some increased OpEx investment that also drove it. But all of this is kind of executing to the plan that Pat laid out a quarter or so ago. And so this is all part of where we wanted to be at this point to drive the future of the company. Sure. So definitely, the Federal charge not repeating itself in the first quarter is certainly helpful. And there are a couple of mix benefits that we're seeing. But the charges associated with ramping 10-nanometer, particularly in the data center space, and the start-up costs on Intel 4 are predominantly what's driving the reduced gross margins. But again, it's exactly where we thought we would be in the first fiscal quarter. I mean this is the number that we were planning to drive the business to. And ultimately, the ROI on all the investments we're making that that drive headwinds in the gross margins for the first quarter will turn around and drive a very good ROI down the road."

And good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter where we navigated a challenging supply environment to deliver year-over-year growth on the top line while beating expectations on gross margin and EPS. We had record third quarter revenue in DCG and Mobileye, while IOTG had an all-time record as it continued its recovery from COVID slowdowns. Our focus on execution continued as we delivered on our initial IDM 2.0 commitments. We broke ground on new fabs, shared our accelerated path to regain process performance leadership, and made our most dramatic architecture announcements in the decade. We also announced major customer wins across every part of our business, including in the data center with AWS and Google, new EVO designs and client, and exciting Mobileye partnerships with ZEEKR and Sixt SE. The demand for semiconductors remains strong, and our factories performed exceptionally well in a highly dynamic environment, where matched sets post huge challenges for our customers, and overall, industry supply remained very constrained. The resilience of our factory network was on display, delivering considerable upside and reacting to rapid demand shifts, reinforcing the unique and strategic value of IDM 2.0. While we're still in the early stages of our journey, we are getting better every day. It is clear that we have to move even faster, be even more nimble, and invest now to achieve our goals of undisputed leadership down the road. I can see the enormous potential that lies ahead, and I couldn't be prouder of the Intel team and the progress that we're making. Let me begin with what we're seeing in the market. Demand remained strong across all of our segments and I continue to believe that we're just starting a cycle of sustained growth, which we are well-positioned to capture. The digitization of everything accelerated by the four superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, and ubiquitous compute are driving the sustained need for more semiconductors and the market is expected to double to $1 trillion by 2030. In that time frame, the market for leading-edge nodes will rise to be over 50% of the total, while the market for leading edge foundry services, will grow at twice the rate of the semi-industry overall. We are one of the few companies with both the technical and financial resources to win in a market that is increasingly leading-edge and challenged by the extreme physics of rejuvenated and continuing Moore's Law. PC demand remains very strong. And we believe that 2021 TAM will grow double-digits even as ecosystems shortages constrain our customers\u2019 ability to shift finished systems. Dell, HP, Lenovo, along with other OEMs and ecosystem partners agree that PCs are now a structurally larger and sustainably growing market. As we head into 2022, we expect the ecosystem supply situation to gradually improve and the PC market will continue to grow as tailwinds from WIN 11, hybrid work models, a larger installed base and compelling new platforms drive PC density, shorter replacement cycles, and penetration of new markets. Against this backdrop, our products have strong momentum driven by compelling platforms including 30 new EVO Tiger Lake designs for 13 of our OEMs. Tiger Lake has shipped more than 70 million units this year, making it our fastest ramping notebook ever. We are raising the bar again with Alder Lake, our first performance hybrid architecture products, which I'm pleased to say began shipping in Q3 on Intel 7 and will start to launch next week at Innovation. The Alder Lake family will offer customers significant advantages across a range of workloads including gaming, content creation, and AI acceleration. Alder Lake will scale from ultra-mobile to desktop and will go to market across our range of segments, form factors, and power envelopes faster than any new architecture in Intel's history. Turning to the data center. New and existing workloads continued to move to the Cloud; security, and privacy requirements are driving enterprise deployments, and the 5G build-out is powering networking. I remain confident about the long-term of the data center, despite regulatory changes in China and short-term ecosystem supply constraints, impacting some customers. Customers continue to choose Intel for the data center needs. And our 3rd Gen scalable Xeon processor Ice Lake has shipped over a million units since launching in April, and we expect to ship over 1 million units again in Q4 alone. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems and we expect all our major cloud customers to have announcements by the end of the year. This includes Google as well as AWS, who have already launched their highest performing Xeon EC2 instances ever, a tremendous milestone resulting from our close collaboration of almost 15 years. Looking ahead, customers remain very excited by Sapphire Rapids, which we expect to have in production in Q1. Sapphire Rapids sets the standard for next-generation data center processors. It was recently selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to power compute intensive modeling supporting their stockpile stewardship program. In core and mobile networks Intel is powering the transformation to virtualize Cloud-native deployments. 50% of new core network deployments are now running on off-the-shelf servers. And we expect that to increase to over 80% by 2024. The next-generation transformation is the virtualization of the radio access network known as VRAM. We're working with service providers globally to enable this transition, including Verizon, Rakuten, Dish Network, and others. Today, nearly all early commercial deployments are running on Xeon and our FlexRAN software reference architecture. We see tremendous opportunity in DRAM and in Q3 we announced the collaboration with Juniper Networks to accelerate future deployments. Overall, we expect global VRAM base station deployments to move from hundreds to hundreds of thousands and eventually millions with private 5G over the next several years. Finally, Edge compute needs continue to grow and our IOTG business had an all-time quarterly record in Q3. In mobility, the market for automotive silicon is expected to more than double to a $115 billion by the end of the decade as AVs begin to move from the garage to the streets. Mobileye is helping to lead this change, and we recently announced that we will begin offering driverless robo-taxi service starting next year in collaboration with Sixt SE. From PC to data center to the network, to the edge, Q3 was full of examples of the increasing need for semiconductors and where customers continue to choose Intel. Since my return, we've not only laid out our roadmap for success, but more importantly, we've already started executing at what I like to say is a torrid pace. Back in March, when we unveiled our powerful new IDM 2.0 strategy, I outlined our course for a new era of innovation at Intel, where I committed to (1) Expand our internal and external manufacturing to address unprecedented global demand for semiconductors. (2) open our doors to be a world-class foundry. (3) regain process leadership. (4) deliver leadership products in every category in which we compete. We are driving progress in every area, so let me talk through each one starting with how we are expanding our manufacturing capacity and our foundry business. Our factories are executing superbly and construction is on or ahead of schedule across all major sites. Last month, we broke ground on our two new fabs in Arizona, three months ahead of schedule. As we expand capacity we're using a smart capital approach so that we can adjust quickly to opportunities in the market and to gain share while managing our margin structure and capital spending. There are three elements to smart capital. First, we're focused on aggressively building our shelf, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab, but have the longest lead time. Having available shelf space gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online. Second, we will make effective use of external foundries, leveraging some of their unique capabilities to ensure we're delivering leadership products. We are already one of the largest foundry customers and in this quarter we announce the key products such as Meteor Lake and Ponte Vecchio will leverage third-parties for some of their tiles. Finally, we expect our plans to benefit from investments from governments who understand that a healthy semiconductor industry is vital to their economic well-being and national security. With bipartisan support in both houses, we're hopeful that chips act will be passed by the end of this year, allowing us to accelerate decisions for our next U.S. site. This will also enable a more level playing field with our competitors who enjoy significant support from their governments. We've also seen considerable interest in the EU with the European Chips Act, and the process to select our next site in Europe is proceeding rapidly. Intel remains the only global company committed to building a leading edge foundry in the U.S. and Europe for customers around the world. Together, IDM 2.0 with smart capital uniquely positions for an enormous and unique market opportunity, including our foundry ambitions. IFS will enable Intel to grow faster, expand monetization of our process and packaging capabilities, leverage our design IPs more broadly, and provide sustainable, superior cash flows from our assets. Since March, we have shipped our first IFS packaging units for revenue. Engage with well over a hundred potential customers, including several large customers, who are working with us on our leading-edge Intel 18A. And we have multiple customers planning test trips on Intel 16 that will be in our factories early next year. We also had a significant win with the U.S. government, which selected Intel to provide commercial foundry services in the first ramp of its ramp C program. We're proud of this achievement and the confidence the U.S. government has in us, to deliver them a trusted foundry capability. In July, at our Intel accelerated event, the team and I shared the most detailed roadmap we've ever provided for process and packaging technology. A roadmap that brings us to performance parity in 24 and clear leadership in 25. I am happy to share that Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 20A, and Intel 18A are all on or ahead of the timelines we set out in July. For example, on Intel 4, we said we had taped out our compute tile for Meteor Lake. In this quarter, it came out of the fab and powered up, and within 30 minutes, with outstanding performance, right where we expected it to be. All told, this is one of the best lead product startups we have seen in recent memory, which speaks to the health of the process. In fact, we are using a pre-production release of the Intel 4 in our newest neuromorphic computing chip, Loihi 2. Finally, on the product front, we are intent on delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. In August at our architecture day, we started delivering on that promises, we made five major architecture announcements, our most dramatic updates in the last decade. We introduced hybrid computing with two new generations of X86 core, enabling power-efficient designs that our performance for the most demanding workloads. We unveiled our Intel ark brand for discrete graphic, starting with our outcome, this product, which will be on shelf in one of next year. We continued our central role in the evolving datacenter landscape with Mount Heavens. Our first asic based infrastructure Processing Unit or IPU, developed in close collaboration with a major cloud provider, our IPUs enable superior security capabilities and let our cloud customers move infrastructure task off the CPU, thereby allowing them to rent 100% of their CPU capacity to their customers. We also gave additional detail on Sapphire Rapids and its compelling AI and accelerator capabilities. And last, but not least, we opened the curtain on Ponte Vecchio. With our highest ever compute density, the 100 billion transistor device delivers industry-leading slots to accelerate AI, HPC, and advanced analytic workloads. Early pumps of Ecu silicone is already demonstrating leadership performance, setting an industry record in both inference and training throughput on popular AI benchmarks. Next week at our Intel Innovation event, we will take the next step forward, with the renewed commitment to developers and a host of new tools, technology, and product announcements. Announcements that really underscore how we are rapidly bringing the geek back. As I have said, we are repositioning the Company for long-term growth, and we are analyzed in the investment plans required to achieve our goals and provide attractive long-term results for our shareholders. It is abundantly clear to us that we must invest in our future right now, to accelerate past the rest of the industry and regain unquestioned leadership in what we do. Our investment plan is aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy to rapidly build our manufacturing capacity in response to the expanding market, grow our share, and to accelerate innovation, enabling Intel to leap ahead with new businesses and capabilities in the future. The recent reorganization around these businesses, along with the new leadership we have added, is already having an impact. However, our CFO, George Davis, recently advised us that he has decided to retire in the first half of next year. We are very grateful to George for his dedicated service, and the leadership with the Company, and he will be working with us for a smooth transition. We are currently engaged in a search for George's successor, and he is helping us with the process. I naturally want to give his successor an opportunity to participate in optimizing our long-range plan. We would not want to hold a critical Investor Day without the new CFO being in place. As such, we have decided to move our event to February 17th of next year. This has the added benefit of hopefully being a more in-person event, while giving us a better view of the government investments from which we expect to benefit. We have made this decision for very practical reasons of George's retirement. The Company is running well. We are confident in our process, technology, and product roadmaps. Our business is healthy and our markets remain strong. And above all, we are executing on our plan. Given the new timing of our Investor Day, I do want to take this opportunity to paint the general picture of what our plan looks like and George will share a few more details in a few minutes. We have a huge opportunity with new businesses in graphics, networking, foundry, and mobility. All large and growing segments. When combined with the continued expansion of our current client and datacenter markets, we cannot, and will not, miss this opportunity. Investing now will enable us to reposition the Company to deliver double-digit revenue growth as these investments pay off. While these investments will pressure free cash flow in the short-term, our operating cash flow will remain strong, reflecting the high quality of our business. And we've remained committed to a healthy and growing dividend. As with free cash flow, our gross margins will be below current levels for the next 2-3 years before recovering, but will remain comfortably above 50% as we continue to exercise financial prudence. We have the utmost confidence that our investment plans will ensure the Company's long-term success and deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing the details with you in Q1 and I am confident you will agree. Before I turn it over to George, let me finish by saying that when I came to the Company, I had three goals for the year: create the strategy, build the team, and rebuild the culture and execution machine. We are only eight months into the journey, but we have already achieved a lot. We now have a clear strategy. We've built the team by bringing a new leadership and adding over 6,000 new engineers to bolster our incredibly talented team. We've reorganized our business units to focus on our key markets. And starting next year, we expect to begin breaking out our results to more closely align with these changes, and to drive increased visibility and accountability. And finally, as I outlined today, momentum is building as we drive a path to our roots of execution and innovation. The entire Intel team understands the work we have ahead of us. But we remain confident about our future. We have the right strategy, the right team, and we are motivated to win. I remain convinced that our best days are still ahead. With that, let me turn it over to George.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results with revenue up 5% and gross margin up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong demand in our DCG and IOTG businesses, despite the highly constrained, industry-wide supply environment. Q3 revenue was $18.1 billion slightly below our guide due to shipping and supply constraints that impacted our businesses. Demand remains strong in our PC business, with particular strength in commercial, desktop, and higher-end consumer notebooks. Offset by inventory digestion in lower-end consume and education segments. Gross margin for the quarter was 57.8% exceeding guide by 280 basis points, primarily due to an increased mix of desktop and premium notebook products. Q3 EPS was $1.71, up $0.61 versus guide. $0.47 of this beat is predominantly due to a McAfee related special dividend associated with the divestiture of their enterprise business, and a onetime tax benefit. We had a strong operating beat of approximately $0.14 per share as well, largely driven by demand for higher-end products and clients, and lower operating expenses relative to guide. In Q3, we generated $9.9 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $5.9 billion and paid dividends of $1.4 billion, moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was $9.7 billion down 2% year-over-year on a challenging compare and continued industry-wide component shortages that are restricting lower end system sales. Note that when excluding the impact of wrapping down our Apple CPU and motor businesses, CCG revenue is up approximately 10% year-over-year. This highlights the strong execution and underlying demand in our client business platform, ASPs in client were up 9% year-over-year, and 16% sequentially on increased desktop volume and a richer mix of premium notebook products. Operating income was $3.3 billion down $237 million year-over-year, primarily due to increased investments in our technology and product roadmap. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on continued recovery in our enterprise and government segment and isolate ramp. These results were slightly below expectations due to industry-wide component supply constraints that primarily impacted our enterprise customers and areas of softness in PRC, including cloud, as customers adapt to new regulations. Platform ASPs were up 3% year-over-year on improved mix, driven primarily by increased enterprise and government volume. Operating income was $2.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year on higher revenue, partially offset by increased investments in our technology and product roadmap. IOTG achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $1 billion, up 54% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID-driven lows, with particular strength in the industrial and retail segments. Operating margin was $276 million, up 352% year-over-year, returning to pre -COVID levels of profitability. PSG revenue was $478 million, up 16% year-over-year. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply, impacting Q3 results and Q4 forecast. Operating margin was $76 million, up 90% year-over-year. Mobileye revenue was $326 million, up 39% year-over-year, and achieved an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin was $105 million, up 123% year-over-year. Mobileye continues to execute well, winning key designs and rapidly growing revenue and profits. Moving to our Q4 outlook. We are forecasting $18.3 billion in revenue, up $200 million quarter-over-quarter, with DCG seeing modest -- more modest growth than previously expected as China demand and supply challenges persist. CCG is expected to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as strong demand for our higher-end products bolstered by the launch of Alder Lake, are being offset by weaker OEM demand for lower end products as they prioritize their limited component supply to support higher-end system sales. We see our edge businesses continuing to recover year-over-year from COVID -related impacts. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 53.5% unchanged from prior expectation, and continues to include the impact of a one-time charge related to our Intel Federal Business. Excluding this charge, gross margin will be approximately 55% down 3 points quarter-over-quarter on new product ramps and factory start-up charges. We're forecasting EPS of $0.90 per share and a tax rate of 13%. We had previously expected $0.13 of the Q3 ICAP gain, to have occurred in Q4, which accounts for the change from prior Q4 expectations. Turning to our full-year outlook, we are holding revenue guidance at $73.5 billion, with gross margin up modestly to 57% and EPS of $5.28, up $0.48 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect CapEx of $18 to $19 billion and free cash flow of approximately $12.5 billion, up $1.5 billion versus prior guidance. In our CCG business, we expect full-year revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year, as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by the ramp-down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue, and the exit of our home gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple in home gateway business, CCG would've been up approximately 9% year-over-year. For DCG, we expect full-year revenue to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year, due to a more competitive environment consistent with our expectations, lower demand from China, and industry-wide component supply constraints. Before moving on to some comments on our longer-term performance, I want to briefly cover changes to our non-GAAP reporting, beginning in 2022, to more closely align with our semiconductor peers. First, we will be removing stock-based compensation from our operating segment and non-GAAP results. Secondly, we will exclude all gains and losses from our ICAP portfolio. The change that allows better comparability between periods by eliminating large variations in performance, as we saw this quarter. We also expect to align our segment reporting with our announced new business unit configuration. We will have more details on what to expect here next quarter. Moving to long-term financial guidance. As Pat mentioned, with the movement of Investor Day to Q1, we want to provide some insights into the early years of our plan. First, our revenue outlook reflects fundamentally strong TAMs across our operating businesses, with growth driven by our leadership products. We see revenue in 2022 of at least $74 billion despite ongoing supply constraints. As supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products into the marketplace, we expect to see our revenue growth accelerate to a 10% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years. For gross margin, with the impact of our investment in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, we expect gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next 2-3 years before moving upward. We are in a time of accelerated investment in capital, process node acceleration, and R&D, as the foundation for changing the trajectory of the past few years. In alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are forecasting 2022 CapEx of $25 billion to $28 billion, with potential for further growth in subsequent years. We believe our investments position the Company for very attractive long-term returns. Before I hand off to Q&A, as Pat mentioned, I plan to retire from Intel in May next year. I've been a public Company CFO now for 15 years and it is time for me to spend more time with family and friends as part of the next chapter in my life, it has been a true privilege, and frankly quite exciting to work with Pat and the leadership team on the launch of IDM 2.0, and I look forward to following our transformation over the next several years. There is no Company like Intel. And the immense talent here serves as a wonderful foundation for the transformation ahead. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.\nTony Balow : Alright. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce the first caller.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk about the gross margins next year. What is the -- you talked about investment in 10-nanometer, but you took those ramps this year, is it the simultaneous ramp of 10, and then startup cost of 7 that pulls that down? And why wouldn't you recover from that in subsequent years as you mature deals thereafter? And I also wanted to ask just as a follow-up, does the accounting change with the numbers have been lower, if not for the change to take stock compensation out of the numbers?\nPat Gelsinger : Let me start with the margin question and then I'll ask George to step in and help. First, I'd just say, this is a pivot point for the Company. We are repositioning Intel for growth to be a long-term growth Company. We see the massive opportunity that we have. Near-term, we could have chosen a more conservative route with modestly better financials, but instead, the Board, the management team, and this is why I came back to the Company, choosing to invest, to maximize the long range business that we have. Overall, these are great markets that we're going to be leaning into with very unique positions that we have with our technologies and products. As you look specifically to next year's margins, here, we see that the decline is driven really by 2 factors. 1 is the new manufacturing nodes. And as you've heard us say, we're going to rapidly move through our 5 nodes in 4 years, and this will have pressure on the margins near term as we ramp those up. But we'll quickly, on an accelerated pace, give us leadership capabilities that will improve margins over the horizon. We're also investing in our future. These investments that we're making now in our roadmap will pay off, as those products return to leadership products, beget leadership pricing, which begets leadership margins. So as we said in our prepared remarks, comfortably above 50% and we're confident in the multi-year recovery of the margins that result from, again, competitive process, competitive products will produce great results for us long term. So overall, a couple of years of pressure returning over that horizon as we see these growth areas and our datacenter, our client business in these four new growth markets, the networking, graphics, mobility, autonomy, foundry. And we've made a strong choice. We're going to be decisive and we're very transparent, right? And upfront, we're laying out an understanding of where we're going and we elected to give that guidance earlier than we might have otherwise, not just for next year, but over the horizon as well. So now is the time and we're making that decision boldly and aggressively. George, you want help in the last parent of the question?\nGeorge Davis: Sure, happy to. The -- we're announcing the accounting change in 2022 just to give people a heads up. It\u2019s -- we think it's a pretty modest impact on gross margin. So it works within the range that we've given for the next couple of years. Obviously, we guided the next 2 to 3 years, not 2022. And so Pat did a good job of laying out what are the key drivers there. And the changes that we're doing on the accounting side are really -- we're out of alignment with the industry on stock-based comp. And we're also I think like you probably we just assume not see these large adjustments in a quarter that are for ICAP related activities. And so we're taking that out of non-GAAP as well. Quite frankly, with those two combined, it was net accretive with those two together over the last couple of years. But we think it's the time to make these change. And we think it's consistent with what the industry has done.\nPat Gelsinger : And the other factor that we did talk about is also starting to give accountable units against our new business unit structures as well, which will give increased transparency to the marketplace and will also give increased accountability internally to drive the execution that we're laying out. So with that, Tony, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and George, congratulations on your retirement. A similar question on the longer-term side of things, Pat. If I look back over the last decade, Intel's grown double-digits, I think once in a single year. So talk a little bit about what gives you the confidence in the Company being able to be a double-digit grower a couple of years out from now?\nPat Gelsinger : Well, thank you. And as we look at these markets, we see clearly the client business with CCG. We don't expect that to be a double-digit grower. We do expect growth coming from the client business. And even IDC now is agreeing with us on growth next year. We do see the opportunity for us to be a share gainer, as well as gaining more of the bill of materials of the clients as well. But our expectations there are modest in the growth of the client business. Clearly, the datacenter business, we do expect to see stronger growth and as our products gets stronger and as we've noted with Sapphire Rapids next year and the roadmap over 23, 24 and 25, We do see ourselves in a position that we\u2019ll be gaining leadership, which allows us to have pricing margin improvements in that product line, and datacenter is growing. But it isn't just the datacenter; it's also these 4 new business areas that we've laid out. And next to datacenter, the networking business, we have a very strong position already, but also the ability to reach into the network and the large growth that we see in the edge where Intel is very uniquely positioned. And the edge market as the 5G becomes an open RAN platform, also, the edge deployments, SmartFactory, smart cities, we're very well-positioned, and we expect to see substantial growth there. In the graphics area, we have a good business today in the Integrated graphics, but the opportunity for us to reach into this large and rapidly growing GPU business, discrete graphics business, high performance computing, we\u2019re extraordinarily well positioned to be able to satisfy what we see almost as insatiable demand in that area. And then of course the mobility business, we're already well underway with our Mobileye business. Very unique technology position. Another great quarter from that team. And then finally, the great synergies we get from leveraging our core manufacturing assets as well as our process technology innovations. And as we noted in the formal comments, over half of the technology industry is going to be leading edge, right, in the second half of this decade. Very few companies can do that, and we're finding great interest for our foundry business to be able to satisfy those. So if you think about the growth in the core business plus these major new business areas, and we've done a lot of modeling against this and really built a very robust plan to go execute it, we feel very confident in the double-digit CAGR that we described. We're excited about it. The teams are leaning into it. And even better than that, our customers are excited about it. And with that customer enthusiasm, I'm very confident in what we've described here. We are leaning in. Now's the time to make it happen. And we're making the investments to realize that today.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks, Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Congratulations, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I'll echo Ross' comments. But George, congratulations on the retirement. Pat, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the long-term growth rate question that Ross just asked, but specifically towards the foundry business. And I'm curious when you think about the gross margin guidance next year and the long-term CAGR of 10% to 12%. What's the impact of foundry? I'm assuming foundry's still going to be relatively small next year in the business, but I'm just trying to get a sense as, as foundry grows, how big of a contributor is it to that 10% to 12% long-term CAGR? And how do we think about the margin profile there as it unfolds?\nPat Gelsinger : Yeah. Thank you. Great question, John. And there's a -- first will be that the revenue impacts and the investment impacts of foundry, are fairly modest in the next couple of years. They don't add that much to the top line. They don't detract that much from the bottom line as we're really building that business now. It's really in the later years where you are going to start to see the revenue impact really start to matter. This is very typical of the foundry business. Takes a couple of years for a customer to pick a foundry, move a design, start to ramp it into the industry. So it really has minimal impact for the next couple of years and then it will start to really deliver in years four and five, and then the second half of the decade more significantly. With respect to margin, we expect that we are in our foundry business having very similar margin structures to the leader in this business today. And we see that as a good business. Maybe a little bit lower margin than our best product margins today, but still would allow us to comfortably be above 50% as I said in the long-term guidance that we laid out. This is a great market for us to be reaching into. It allows us to leverage the R&D investments that we have and process technology to more markets. Many of our AFP blocks, as we open up the X86 architecture for increasing innovation we get to leverage enormous amounts of R&D for new monetization opportunities. Also, we're leveraging our smart capital strategy, where we build shelves and we start that process early. That allows us to get those investments in the ground to start building some of that IFF capacity. But it also allows us to have capacity for increased market share gains and leveraging the balance between our internal and our foundry customers as well. And to leverage government investments we expect will be driven substantially to benefit the IFS business. So when we take all of that together, unique technology position, more flexible and leverage capital positions, unique IP benefits that we bring to it, we're seeing great interest from our foundry customers already. We're seeing that on mature nodes like our Intel 16, but very much from some of the largest customers in the industry with our leading-edge technologies where we're getting a lot of excitement to be on the best transistors that are available on the planet with the manufacturing capacity that we can bring. We see this as a great compliment to our business, and so far, things are going even better than I would've thought when I announced this business early in the year.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nStacy Rasgon: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask a question on the current quarter results. Specifically data center ASP. Cloud was down 20% year-over-year. Enterprise was up 70% year-over-year. Yet your ASP was down -- we're down pretty materially sequentially. How do I reconcile that, given the mix there such with the ice Lake ramping, everything should have gotten much better. What happened with data center ASP in the quarter?\nPat Gelsinger : A couple of things Stacy. First, the mix of products in the quarter were more weighted towards what I would call our ACC products down from a fee stand point from our XCC and that part of that is coming out of the lower cloud than we expected.\nGeorge Davis: I would say the other piece is, we saw a bounce up in our network SOCs. And as you know, those have much lower ASPs and tend to be dilutive to ASP. And that was relative to Q2.\nStacy Rasgon: Enterprise is up 70%. Shouldn't the mix have gotten much better? What impact was competition or anything else here? It seems like there has to be something else going on, it can't just be mix.\nGeorge Davis: One is the SOC -- the enterprise piece is as I said, is a mix of products that we saw. It was skewed down from our FCC in the quarter with the enterprise as well.\nPat Gelsinger : But the ASP s of any individual product line, we're still very in line with our normal ASPs for those individual products, Stacy. So overall, we just say it was a mix discussion this quarter. It wasn't an ASP discussion at that level, even though, you average those together, and you get different effects. Also, as we said for the data-center business, we did have some unique issues in China this quarter, which led to some different behavior in that business. Some of the regulatory issues there. So overall, not where we would have expected the data-center to be for the quarter, but still a very strong performance. And we're happy with the growth that we're seeing in that business. And as we've indicated, the momentum of Ice Lake is growing. Sapphire Rapids, great interest in that product. So we're seeing that the overall competitiveness and the growth of that business area's looking very good for us for the future, we're excited about it and everything is going as we would have hoped for that business.\nStacy Rasgon: Are those trying to regulatory issues permanent?\nPat Gelsinger : They -- as you might have seen, there's been some regulatory questions around gaming in China. And all of the Cloud vendors are adjusting their offerings to meet that new regulatory environment, so we expect it's a quarter or 2 for them to digest what they would look like. We do expect that market to recover going forward. And as you're probably aware, we have uniquely high market share in the Chinese Cloud market. So as it recovers, we expect a nice recovery in that business area for us and we expect that there will be a return to normalcy next year in that area of our business.\nGeorge Davis: And just for adding clarity, we're -- we expect it to continue in Q4.\nPat Gelsinger : Yeah.\nTony Balow : Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. George, I wanted to ask about gross margin puts and take more over the longer term. So you're saying 51 to 53 over the next couple of years, and then moving higher after the next few years. But at the same time, CapEx is also going to 25 to 28 next year, and it sounds like it might be higher than that. And depreciation is still only $11 billion right now. So that's going to obviously go up a lot too. So I think, that the obvious question is going to be how believable it is that gross margin can ultimately come back given that, I would think that the depreciation is going to be ramping in those out-years. So can you just sort of hold our hand there in terms of how believable it is that gross margin can come back when there's just such a gap between depreciation and CapEx? Thanks.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. For sure. First off, I think part of the reason for spending this amount of CapEx is to catch up with the capacity shortfalls that we've had. And also to build in more flexibility. These things all support higher revenue over time, which helps absorb some of the depreciation. That being said, it will be growing. No question. Our depreciation impact will be growing over the next couple of years. The impact of o-cost, which is all the Investment that is going on outside of depreciation in the note acceleration that Pat has been talking to, that has a big impact, particularly over the next few years because of the number of nodes that are being worked in parallel. So we think that gets better coming out of this period. And we've had a pretty reasonable assumption inside of our gross margin estimates for how much unit cost are going up, and then how much of that you can recover in ASP. So there's no big missing element. I think it's -- we expect to -- as we've said, we expect to grow into our investment, and we expect the investment in node compression takes less of a toll as we come out of this period.\nPat Gelsinger : And ultimately we're making those investments in node compression to get more competitive products and more capabilities. And as the products get more competitive, better pricing, better margins, which enable us to have not only better gross margins, but obviously we'll have the flow-through benefits into cash flows as we are impacting our CapEx investments. All of these things start to generate positively as we get back on top of our competitive position. And as we said, we've had an extraordinary quarter since we last met every one of our process nodes that we described. Some said when we described 5 nodes in 4 years, that's never been done in history. And we said, that's right and we're going to do it. And as I updated in the formal comments, all of those nodes, Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 28, Intel 18A, on or ahead of schedule. Relatively speaking, we're closing the gap on the industry, probably even more rapidly than I would've expected just a quarter ago. And as a result of that, these investments will be producing superior products with superior pricing and margins more rapidly, than we would have forecast even a quarter ago. So overall, we think all of these things are now starting to play together. Obviously, we have a couple of years to work through. But this is going to be a great outcome. And we think all of our aggressive leanings right now are going to be handsomely rewarded in the marketplace to our customers and to our shareholders over time..\nTimothy Arcuri: Thank you, Pat.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a question on CapEx. So you've outlined a higher number for calendar '22, but as I think about and contemplate higher intensity at the bleeding edge nodes, it would appear that that would really be for Intel only. So should we be thinking about a step-up above and beyond that level, as you build out capacity for IFS over time? And then, second quick question around that. Are you making any changes to how you're accounting for depreciation of lifetime on equipment or buildings, or any anything like that, as part of the accounting changes that you've outlined tonight? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger : So the initial CapEx of use go obviously, as you said, building out shelf capacity, building flexibility into it, as George indicated. In subsequent years might be going up a bit more. But as we've also said, we do expect to see the opportunity for government investments to enable us to go bigger and faster on our CapEx investments. So the numbers that we've given reflect the initial build-out of our foundry business. So we feel comfortable in that. And we've also described our smart capital strategy that gives us more flexibility for what we do internally, what we do in our foundries. The ability to benefit from government of estimates, the flexible build-out of shelves. And overall, we see -- these investments allow us to grow, right? And grow share, right? Gain. Foundry customers, where as those get committed, will build out the specific capacity. And then balancing of foundry, which enables us to leverage industry capacity as well as our own, and everything we bring internally will be a better margins associated with it. So overall, we think it's a very uniquely, powerful, resilient, and favorable strategy for us to execute overtime.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. And C.J., the accounting changes that we're talking about. Number 1, are to increase transparency into the business by breaking out the segments the way Pat has been describing the segments of the markets that we're going to be addressing. The other changes are really just to align with the industry. So when people look at our non-GAAP numbers, they are going to see the same basis for that as most of our peers. And so no accounting changes that we're talking about that relate to how we treat depreciation of assets.\nTony Balow : Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just 2 on gross margin. 1. Just near-term -- the federal impact in Q4 just remind us of that continues in the first half and then you're starting at 55 when they are guiding long term kind of 51 to 53 and it seems pretty clear as you ramp more Intel 7 products, the margin is still going down substantially. So I'm just trying to think about probably you don't want to guide next year, but trying to figure out within that range, are you going to be closer to the bottom of it as you ramp more of the clients[Indiscernible] majority of Q4 and then you are obviously observers on the way as well. So just trying to understand the impact in the near-term here on gross margin and then kind of just long term as well. It doesn't seem like listen to your comments, Pat, that it does require that double-digit top-line. So just want to understand, I think a lot of people may think the CAGR maybe half that on this call. So just trying to understand how flexibly could be as it relates to the gross margin line with your spending with the smart capital plan. Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger : Look, on Q4, gross margin is pretty much the way we saw it when we talked about it last quarter, when we are guiding for the rest of the year. The Intel Federal impact is a one quarter impact. And so it does not carry forward. We're -- to the extent that you want to think about 22 gross margin, I think again,\nGeorge Davis: 51% to 53% for the next 2-3 years. And really the biggest hitters being the impact of higher capital, which we see accelerating in Q4 this year, going into next year and then the effect of the multiple node compression. Those are the key dynamics that we see. So that's all we can guide at this point.\nPat Gelsinger : And overall, as we've said, we feel confident in these numbers. We're giving a lot more transparency. We're taking the opportunity to give you more understanding of our business. We're electing to do that earlier in the process than we might otherwise because we're making these decisions, were choosing to give you a lot more understanding of the business. We're confident in these growth outlooks as well. These are exciting new market categories, right? That we are leaning into. They are large market categories. And it's not just that they are large categories, right? They reinforce each other. The stronger am in networking, the stronger I am in data-center. The stronger I am in client, the stronger I am in graphics. The stronger I am on my process technology, the stronger I am in my foundry business. Every one of these is building on each other and creating synergy value. And overall, right, as we move to leadership in these areas that we are well on track on doing that. We feel quite confident that growth rate, the margin profiles, it will of course, take the opportunity. At our Analyst Day to dig into the business areas quite a bit more. And we're going to help you understand those. We're going to give you segment reporting that helps you see those and be able to get transparency and accountability through it. But overall, we believe we are laying out a pretty exciting path that the management team, Board of Directors, and our customers are really leaning back into us to say, yes, this is Intel. We're excited for the future. Now is the time.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger : Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks for taking my question. And George,[Indiscernible] next step. I wonder what your life is going to look like not answering every day questions about Intel\nPierre Ferragu: Gross margin. And so maybe I'm daring to ask you another question on gross margin, but I won\u2019t just to make sure I give you a bit of fresh air. I will [Indiscernible] you said earlier question just for you, George. [Indiscernible] You haven't talked about market shares of those transition barriers. Next 2-3 years looking at gross margins, just to take maybe stepped down; you're going to invest alerts. How do you see your market share evolving and why? And then I[Indiscernible] relating that gross margin, in your gross margin guide, is there an element of taking prices down to protect gross margin during the transition, or is that purely driven by investments?\nPat Gelsinger : Overall, we expect that we'll be in a position to gain market share in our existing markets as we're making these capital investments. We've been woefully short of capacity for a number of years. This is great opportunity in the industry. And as everybody in every industry anywhere in the world realizes, semiconductors are hot. We need more of these so we're building the capacity to satisfy that. In the near-term capacity is destiny. Building more capacity enables us to gain more market share. And we think we can do that as our products get stronger with very favorable pricing conditions as well. And for instance, in the client business Alder Lake goes in production, they will be talking more about that next week. A tremendous product that will be a great market share gainer, as well as a pricing leader, right? As well as structured across the segments that allows us to gain share across multiple segments of the client marketplace. Also, I'd point out that these 4 areas, these 4 new growth businesses; we're very small in those businesses today. These have massive growth potential for us large, favorable markets that are looking for leadership, logic, capabilities, that Intel is uniquely positioned to supply into the industry. And overall, clearly the near-term as we've lain out with great transparency, some of the margin impacts in the near-term, but these are great investments. Great investments in large, growing, favorable markets that very few companies have even the opportunity to participate in. And we bring such massive assets to them, that we believe that we're going to be well-positioned to gain leadership positions across networking, accelerated computing, and graphics, in the autonomous vehicle category, in the foundry business. And you combine that with share gaining positions and client to data-center. This is a tremendous period of time. We're seizing the opportunity. Carpe Diem.\nPierre Ferragu: Thanks Pat.\nPat Gelsinger : Very good. Last question.\nOperator: Last question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the data-center business. One on product and one on the results. On the product, I think, you guys reiterated that Sapphire would be shipping in Q1. Pat, I wondered if you might give some commentary on when you expect to see some legit volume ramps of Sapphire and has that timing moved? The second part of the question is on the results. It looks like the Cloud segment was down 20% year-over-year off of a plus 15 last year. So I don't know by my math, we're down say mid to high singles from Q3 Cloud levels 2 years ago pre -COVID, and CapEx has been pretty strong since. So you guys called out China, but there's some other things going on with market share. Maybe you could address those and talk about how we reverse some of that share loss? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. On Sapphire Rapids, it's exactly what we said back in June of this year, that's -- it's going to be in production in Q1, ramp in Q2. So no change in its timing. We're working through the latter stages of the production process with the design, getting all of the elements of it worked out as we're ready to begin that volume ramp in Q2 of next year and on track for Q1 launch. With respect to the datacenter cloud business in Q3, and we'll see some of this in Q4 as well, largely is exactly what we said. Unique exposure to China where we have uniquely high market share. Nothing else significant going on in that business, that really is the story. Overall, the server business is constrained by supply. And this would be things like [Indiscernible] controllers and power supply devices that are holding us back from achieving, and trust me, we would be shipping a lot more units if we weren't constrained by the supply chain of these other components in the industry. Our customers, both Cloud customers and OEMS, very strong backlogs that they're pressing us aggressively to satisfy. But really limited by these match sets, as we call it in the industry. So other than those 2 factors, China and match sets, everything else is going as expected for the data-center business. So maybe then let me just wrap up our call today by saying, I am so proud of the talented committed team here at Intel. Despite all of the challenges of working through the supply constraints, our teams, our factories, our product designers, the software developers are performing so well. The execution machine that we have is restoring very rapidly and a deep sense of desire that we can, and we will win. I also want to take the chance to personally thank George for his leadership. All the things that he's done for our Company, adjusted commitments, seeing through a smooth transition to his successor. We've taken the first steps of our journey and I can't wait to share more of our successes in the future. Thanks for joining us today.\nTony Balow : Alright, thank you. Got it. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator, could you please close the call?\nOperator: Yes, sir. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. And good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter where we navigated a challenging supply environment to deliver year-over-year growth on the top line while beating expectations on gross margin and EPS. We had record third quarter revenue in DCG and Mobileye, while IOTG had an all-time record as it continued its recovery from COVID slowdowns. Our focus on execution continued as we delivered on our initial IDM 2.0 commitments. We broke ground on new fabs, shared our accelerated path to regain process performance leadership, and made our most dramatic architecture announcements in the decade. We also announced major customer wins across every part of our business, including in the data center with AWS and Google, new EVO designs and client, and exciting Mobileye partnerships with ZEEKR and Sixt SE. The demand for semiconductors remains strong, and our factories performed exceptionally well in a highly dynamic environment, where matched sets post huge challenges for our customers, and overall, industry supply remained very constrained. The resilience of our factory network was on display, delivering considerable upside and reacting to rapid demand shifts, reinforcing the unique and strategic value of IDM 2.0. While we're still in the early stages of our journey, we are getting better every day. It is clear that we have to move even faster, be even more nimble, and invest now to achieve our goals of undisputed leadership down the road. I can see the enormous potential that lies ahead, and I couldn't be prouder of the Intel team and the progress that we're making. Let me begin with what we're seeing in the market. Demand remained strong across all of our segments and I continue to believe that we're just starting a cycle of sustained growth, which we are well-positioned to capture. The digitization of everything accelerated by the four superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, and ubiquitous compute are driving the sustained need for more semiconductors and the market is expected to double to $1 trillion by 2030. In that time frame, the market for leading-edge nodes will rise to be over 50% of the total, while the market for leading edge foundry services, will grow at twice the rate of the semi-industry overall. We are one of the few companies with both the technical and financial resources to win in a market that is increasingly leading-edge and challenged by the extreme physics of rejuvenated and continuing Moore's Law. PC demand remains very strong. And we believe that 2021 TAM will grow double-digits even as ecosystems shortages constrain our customers' ability to shift finished systems. Dell, HP, Lenovo, along with other OEMs and ecosystem partners agree that PCs are now a structurally larger and sustainably growing market. As we head into 2022, we expect the ecosystem supply situation to gradually improve and the PC market will continue to grow as tailwinds from WIN 11, hybrid work models, a larger installed base and compelling new platforms drive PC density, shorter replacement cycles, and penetration of new markets. Against this backdrop, our products have strong momentum driven by compelling platforms including 30 new EVO Tiger Lake designs for 13 of our OEMs. Tiger Lake has shipped more than 70 million units this year, making it our fastest ramping notebook ever. We are raising the bar again with Alder Lake, our first performance hybrid architecture products, which I'm pleased to say began shipping in Q3 on Intel 7 and will start to launch next week at Innovation. The Alder Lake family will offer customers significant advantages across a range of workloads including gaming, content creation, and AI acceleration. Alder Lake will scale from ultra-mobile to desktop and will go to market across our range of segments, form factors, and power envelopes faster than any new architecture in Intel's history. Turning to the data center. New and existing workloads continued to move to the Cloud; security, and privacy requirements are driving enterprise deployments, and the 5G build-out is powering networking. I remain confident about the long-term of the data center, despite regulatory changes in China and short-term ecosystem supply constraints, impacting some customers. Customers continue to choose Intel for the data center needs. And our 3rd Gen scalable Xeon processor Ice Lake has shipped over a million units since launching in April, and we expect to ship over 1 million units again in Q4 alone. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems and we expect all our major cloud customers to have announcements by the end of the year. This includes Google as well as AWS, who have already launched their highest performing Xeon EC2 instances ever, a tremendous milestone resulting from our close collaboration of almost 15 years. Looking ahead, customers remain very excited by Sapphire Rapids, which we expect to have in production in Q1. Sapphire Rapids sets the standard for next-generation data center processors. It was recently selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to power compute intensive modeling supporting their stockpile stewardship program. In core and mobile networks Intel is powering the transformation to virtualize Cloud-native deployments. 50% of new core network deployments are now running on off-the-shelf servers. And we expect that to increase to over 80% by 2024. The next-generation transformation is the virtualization of the radio access network known as VRAM. We're working with service providers globally to enable this transition, including Verizon, Rakuten, Dish Network, and others. Today, nearly all early commercial deployments are running on Xeon and our FlexRAN software reference architecture. We see tremendous opportunity in DRAM and in Q3 we announced the collaboration with Juniper Networks to accelerate future deployments. Overall, we expect global VRAM base station deployments to move from hundreds to hundreds of thousands and eventually millions with private 5G over the next several years. Finally, Edge compute needs continue to grow and our IOTG business had an all-time quarterly record in Q3. In mobility, the market for automotive silicon is expected to more than double to a $115 billion by the end of the decade as AVs begin to move from the garage to the streets. Mobileye is helping to lead this change, and we recently announced that we will begin offering driverless robo-taxi service starting next year in collaboration with Sixt SE. From PC to data center to the network, to the edge, Q3 was full of examples of the increasing need for semiconductors and where customers continue to choose Intel. Since my return, we've not only laid out our roadmap for success, but more importantly, we've already started executing at what I like to say is a torrid pace. Back in March, when we unveiled our powerful new IDM 2.0 strategy, I outlined our course for a new era of innovation at Intel, where I committed to (1) Expand our internal and external manufacturing to address unprecedented global demand for semiconductors. (2) open our doors to be a world-class foundry. (3) regain process leadership. (4) deliver leadership products in every category in which we compete. We are driving progress in every area, so let me talk through each one starting with how we are expanding our manufacturing capacity and our foundry business. Our factories are executing superbly and construction is on or ahead of schedule across all major sites. Last month, we broke ground on our two new fabs in Arizona, three months ahead of schedule. As we expand capacity we're using a smart capital approach so that we can adjust quickly to opportunities in the market and to gain share while managing our margin structure and capital spending. There are three elements to smart capital. First, we're focused on aggressively building our shelf, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of a fab, but have the longest lead time. Having available shelf space gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online. Second, we will make effective use of external foundries, leveraging some of their unique capabilities to ensure we're delivering leadership products. We are already one of the largest foundry customers and in this quarter we announce the key products such as Meteor Lake and Ponte Vecchio will leverage third-parties for some of their tiles. Finally, we expect our plans to benefit from investments from governments who understand that a healthy semiconductor industry is vital to their economic well-being and national security. With bipartisan support in both houses, we're hopeful that chips act will be passed by the end of this year, allowing us to accelerate decisions for our next U.S. site. This will also enable a more level playing field with our competitors who enjoy significant support from their governments. We've also seen considerable interest in the EU with the European Chips Act, and the process to select our next site in Europe is proceeding rapidly. Intel remains the only global company committed to building a leading edge foundry in the U.S. and Europe for customers around the world. Together, IDM 2.0 with smart capital uniquely positions for an enormous and unique market opportunity, including our foundry ambitions. IFS will enable Intel to grow faster, expand monetization of our process and packaging capabilities, leverage our design IPs more broadly, and provide sustainable, superior cash flows from our assets. Since March, we have shipped our first IFS packaging units for revenue. Engage with well over a hundred potential customers, including several large customers, who are working with us on our leading-edge Intel 18A. And we have multiple customers planning test trips on Intel 16 that will be in our factories early next year. We also had a significant win with the U.S. government, which selected Intel to provide commercial foundry services in the first ramp of its ramp C program. We're proud of this achievement and the confidence the U.S. government has in us, to deliver them a trusted foundry capability. In July, at our Intel accelerated event, the team and I shared the most detailed roadmap we've ever provided for process and packaging technology. A roadmap that brings us to performance parity in 24 and clear leadership in 25. I am happy to share that Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 20A, and Intel 18A are all on or ahead of the timelines we set out in July. For example, on Intel 4, we said we had taped out our compute tile for Meteor Lake. In this quarter, it came out of the fab and powered up, and within 30 minutes, with outstanding performance, right where we expected it to be. All told, this is one of the best lead product startups we have seen in recent memory, which speaks to the health of the process. In fact, we are using a pre-production release of the Intel 4 in our newest neuromorphic computing chip, Loihi 2. Finally, on the product front, we are intent on delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. In August at our architecture day, we started delivering on that promises, we made five major architecture announcements, our most dramatic updates in the last decade. We introduced hybrid computing with two new generations of X86 core, enabling power-efficient designs that our performance for the most demanding workloads. We unveiled our Intel ark brand for discrete graphic, starting with our outcome, this product, which will be on shelf in one of next year. We continued our central role in the evolving datacenter landscape with Mount Heavens. Our first asic based infrastructure Processing Unit or IPU, developed in close collaboration with a major cloud provider, our IPUs enable superior security capabilities and let our cloud customers move infrastructure task off the CPU, thereby allowing them to rent 100% of their CPU capacity to their customers. We also gave additional detail on Sapphire Rapids and its compelling AI and accelerator capabilities. And last, but not least, we opened the curtain on Ponte Vecchio. With our highest ever compute density, the 100 billion transistor device delivers industry-leading slots to accelerate AI, HPC, and advanced analytic workloads. Early pumps of Ecu silicone is already demonstrating leadership performance, setting an industry record in both inference and training throughput on popular AI benchmarks. Next week at our Intel Innovation event, we will take the next step forward, with the renewed commitment to developers and a host of new tools, technology, and product announcements. Announcements that really underscore how we are rapidly bringing the geek back. As I have said, we are repositioning the Company for long-term growth, and we are analyzed in the investment plans required to achieve our goals and provide attractive long-term results for our shareholders. It is abundantly clear to us that we must invest in our future right now, to accelerate past the rest of the industry and regain unquestioned leadership in what we do. Our investment plan is aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy to rapidly build our manufacturing capacity in response to the expanding market, grow our share, and to accelerate innovation, enabling Intel to leap ahead with new businesses and capabilities in the future. The recent reorganization around these businesses, along with the new leadership we have added, is already having an impact. However, our CFO, George Davis, recently advised us that he has decided to retire in the first half of next year. We are very grateful to George for his dedicated service, and the leadership with the Company, and he will be working with us for a smooth transition. We are currently engaged in a search for George's successor, and he is helping us with the process. I naturally want to give his successor an opportunity to participate in optimizing our long-range plan. We would not want to hold a critical Investor Day without the new CFO being in place. As such, we have decided to move our event to February 17th of next year. This has the added benefit of hopefully being a more in-person event, while giving us a better view of the government investments from which we expect to benefit. We have made this decision for very practical reasons of George's retirement. The Company is running well. We are confident in our process, technology, and product roadmaps. Our business is healthy and our markets remain strong. And above all, we are executing on our plan. Given the new timing of our Investor Day, I do want to take this opportunity to paint the general picture of what our plan looks like and George will share a few more details in a few minutes. We have a huge opportunity with new businesses in graphics, networking, foundry, and mobility. All large and growing segments. When combined with the continued expansion of our current client and datacenter markets, we cannot, and will not, miss this opportunity. Investing now will enable us to reposition the Company to deliver double-digit revenue growth as these investments pay off. While these investments will pressure free cash flow in the short-term, our operating cash flow will remain strong, reflecting the high quality of our business. And we've remained committed to a healthy and growing dividend. As with free cash flow, our gross margins will be below current levels for the next 2-3 years before recovering, but will remain comfortably above 50% as we continue to exercise financial prudence. We have the utmost confidence that our investment plans will ensure the Company's long-term success and deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing the details with you in Q1 and I am confident you will agree. Before I turn it over to George, let me finish by saying that when I came to the Company, I had three goals for the year: create the strategy, build the team, and rebuild the culture and execution machine. We are only eight months into the journey, but we have already achieved a lot. We now have a clear strategy. We've built the team by bringing a new leadership and adding over 6,000 new engineers to bolster our incredibly talented team. We've reorganized our business units to focus on our key markets. And starting next year, we expect to begin breaking out our results to more closely align with these changes, and to drive increased visibility and accountability. And finally, as I outlined today, momentum is building as we drive a path to our roots of execution and innovation. The entire Intel team understands the work we have ahead of us. But we remain confident about our future. We have the right strategy, the right team, and we are motivated to win. I remain convinced that our best days are still ahead. With that, let me turn it over to George. Let me start with the margin question and then I'll ask George to step in and help. First, I'd just say, this is a pivot point for the Company. We are repositioning Intel for growth to be a long-term growth Company. We see the massive opportunity that we have. Near-term, we could have chosen a more conservative route with modestly better financials, but instead, the Board, the management team, and this is why I came back to the Company, choosing to invest, to maximize the long range business that we have. Overall, these are great markets that we're going to be leaning into with very unique positions that we have with our technologies and products. As you look specifically to next year's margins, here, we see that the decline is driven really by 2 factors. 1 is the new manufacturing nodes. And as you've heard us say, we're going to rapidly move through our 5 nodes in 4 years, and this will have pressure on the margins near term as we ramp those up. But we'll quickly, on an accelerated pace, give us leadership capabilities that will improve margins over the horizon. We're also investing in our future. These investments that we're making now in our roadmap will pay off, as those products return to leadership products, beget leadership pricing, which begets leadership margins. So as we said in our prepared remarks, comfortably above 50% and we're confident in the multi-year recovery of the margins that result from, again, competitive process, competitive products will produce great results for us long term. So overall, a couple of years of pressure returning over that horizon as we see these growth areas and our datacenter, our client business in these four new growth markets, the networking, graphics, mobility, autonomy, foundry. And we've made a strong choice. We're going to be decisive and we're very transparent, right? And upfront, we're laying out an understanding of where we're going and we elected to give that guidance earlier than we might have otherwise, not just for next year, but over the horizon as well. So now is the time and we're making that decision boldly and aggressively. George, you want help in the last parent of the question? And the other factor that we did talk about is also starting to give accountable units against our new business unit structures as well, which will give increased transparency to the marketplace and will also give increased accountability internally to drive the execution that we're laying out. So with that, Tony, next question. Well, thank you. And as we look at these markets, we see clearly the client business with CCG. We don't expect that to be a double-digit grower. We do expect growth coming from the client business. And even IDC now is agreeing with us on growth next year. We do see the opportunity for us to be a share gainer, as well as gaining more of the bill of materials of the clients as well. But our expectations there are modest in the growth of the client business. Clearly, the datacenter business, we do expect to see stronger growth and as our products gets stronger and as we've noted with Sapphire Rapids next year and the roadmap over 23, 24 and 25, We do see ourselves in a position that we'll be gaining leadership, which allows us to have pricing margin improvements in that product line, and datacenter is growing. But it isn't just the datacenter; it's also these 4 new business areas that we've laid out. And next to datacenter, the networking business, we have a very strong position already, but also the ability to reach into the network and the large growth that we see in the edge where Intel is very uniquely positioned. And the edge market as the 5G becomes an open RAN platform, also, the edge deployments, SmartFactory, smart cities, we're very well-positioned, and we expect to see substantial growth there. In the graphics area, we have a good business today in the Integrated graphics, but the opportunity for us to reach into this large and rapidly growing GPU business, discrete graphics business, high performance computing, we're extraordinarily well positioned to be able to satisfy what we see almost as insatiable demand in that area. And then of course the mobility business, we're already well underway with our Mobileye business. Very unique technology position. Another great quarter from that team. And then finally, the great synergies we get from leveraging our core manufacturing assets as well as our process technology innovations. And as we noted in the formal comments, over half of the technology industry is going to be leading edge, right, in the second half of this decade. Very few companies can do that, and we're finding great interest for our foundry business to be able to satisfy those. So if you think about the growth in the core business plus these major new business areas, and we've done a lot of modeling against this and really built a very robust plan to go execute it, we feel very confident in the double-digit CAGR that we described. We're excited about it. The teams are leaning into it. And even better than that, our customers are excited about it. And with that customer enthusiasm, I'm very confident in what we've described here. We are leaning in. Now's the time to make it happen. And we're making the investments to realize that today. Yeah. Thank you. Great question, John. And there's a -- first will be that the revenue impacts and the investment impacts of foundry, are fairly modest in the next couple of years. They don't add that much to the top line. They don't detract that much from the bottom line as we're really building that business now. It's really in the later years where you are going to start to see the revenue impact really start to matter. This is very typical of the foundry business. Takes a couple of years for a customer to pick a foundry, move a design, start to ramp it into the industry. So it really has minimal impact for the next couple of years and then it will start to really deliver in years four and five, and then the second half of the decade more significantly. With respect to margin, we expect that we are in our foundry business having very similar margin structures to the leader in this business today. And we see that as a good business. Maybe a little bit lower margin than our best product margins today, but still would allow us to comfortably be above 50% as I said in the long-term guidance that we laid out. This is a great market for us to be reaching into. It allows us to leverage the R&D investments that we have and process technology to more markets. Many of our AFP blocks, as we open up the X86 architecture for increasing innovation we get to leverage enormous amounts of R&D for new monetization opportunities. Also, we're leveraging our smart capital strategy, where we build shelves and we start that process early. That allows us to get those investments in the ground to start building some of that IFF capacity. But it also allows us to have capacity for increased market share gains and leveraging the balance between our internal and our foundry customers as well. And to leverage government investments we expect will be driven substantially to benefit the IFS business. So when we take all of that together, unique technology position, more flexible and leverage capital positions, unique IP benefits that we bring to it, we're seeing great interest from our foundry customers already. We're seeing that on mature nodes like our Intel 16, but very much from some of the largest customers in the industry with our leading-edge technologies where we're getting a lot of excitement to be on the best transistors that are available on the planet with the manufacturing capacity that we can bring. We see this as a great compliment to our business, and so far, things are going even better than I would've thought when I announced this business early in the year. A couple of things Stacy. First, the mix of products in the quarter were more weighted towards what I would call our ACC products down from a fee stand point from our XCC and that part of that is coming out of the lower cloud than we expected. But the ASP s of any individual product line, we're still very in line with our normal ASPs for those individual products, Stacy. So overall, we just say it was a mix discussion this quarter. It wasn't an ASP discussion at that level, even though, you average those together, and you get different effects. Also, as we said for the data-center business, we did have some unique issues in China this quarter, which led to some different behavior in that business. Some of the regulatory issues there. So overall, not where we would have expected the data-center to be for the quarter, but still a very strong performance. And we're happy with the growth that we're seeing in that business. And as we've indicated, the momentum of Ice Lake is growing. Sapphire Rapids, great interest in that product. So we're seeing that the overall competitiveness and the growth of that business area's looking very good for us for the future, we're excited about it and everything is going as we would have hoped for that business. They -- as you might have seen, there's been some regulatory questions around gaming in China. And all of the Cloud vendors are adjusting their offerings to meet that new regulatory environment, so we expect it's a quarter or 2 for them to digest what they would look like. We do expect that market to recover going forward. And as you're probably aware, we have uniquely high market share in the Chinese Cloud market. So as it recovers, we expect a nice recovery in that business area for us and we expect that there will be a return to normalcy next year in that area of our business. Yeah. And ultimately we're making those investments in node compression to get more competitive products and more capabilities. And as the products get more competitive, better pricing, better margins, which enable us to have not only better gross margins, but obviously we'll have the flow-through benefits into cash flows as we are impacting our CapEx investments. All of these things start to generate positively as we get back on top of our competitive position. And as we said, we've had an extraordinary quarter since we last met every one of our process nodes that we described. Some said when we described 5 nodes in 4 years, that's never been done in history. And we said, that's right and we're going to do it. And as I updated in the formal comments, all of those nodes, Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 28, Intel 18A, on or ahead of schedule. Relatively speaking, we're closing the gap on the industry, probably even more rapidly than I would've expected just a quarter ago. And as a result of that, these investments will be producing superior products with superior pricing and margins more rapidly, than we would have forecast even a quarter ago. So overall, we think all of these things are now starting to play together. Obviously, we have a couple of years to work through. But this is going to be a great outcome. And we think all of our aggressive leanings right now are going to be handsomely rewarded in the marketplace to our customers and to our shareholders over time.. So the initial CapEx of use go obviously, as you said, building out shelf capacity, building flexibility into it, as George indicated. In subsequent years might be going up a bit more. But as we've also said, we do expect to see the opportunity for government investments to enable us to go bigger and faster on our CapEx investments. So the numbers that we've given reflect the initial build-out of our foundry business. So we feel comfortable in that. And we've also described our smart capital strategy that gives us more flexibility for what we do internally, what we do in our foundries. The ability to benefit from government of estimates, the flexible build-out of shelves. And overall, we see -- these investments allow us to grow, right? And grow share, right? Gain. Foundry customers, where as those get committed, will build out the specific capacity. And then balancing of foundry, which enables us to leverage industry capacity as well as our own, and everything we bring internally will be a better margins associated with it. So overall, we think it's a very uniquely, powerful, resilient, and favorable strategy for us to execute overtime. Look, on Q4, gross margin is pretty much the way we saw it when we talked about it last quarter, when we are guiding for the rest of the year. The Intel Federal impact is a one quarter impact. And so it does not carry forward. We're -- to the extent that you want to think about 22 gross margin, I think again, And overall, as we've said, we feel confident in these numbers. We're giving a lot more transparency. We're taking the opportunity to give you more understanding of our business. We're electing to do that earlier in the process than we might otherwise because we're making these decisions, were choosing to give you a lot more understanding of the business. We're confident in these growth outlooks as well. These are exciting new market categories, right? That we are leaning into. They are large market categories. And it's not just that they are large categories, right? They reinforce each other. The stronger am in networking, the stronger I am in data-center. The stronger I am in client, the stronger I am in graphics. The stronger I am on my process technology, the stronger I am in my foundry business. Every one of these is building on each other and creating synergy value. And overall, right, as we move to leadership in these areas that we are well on track on doing that. We feel quite confident that growth rate, the margin profiles, it will of course, take the opportunity. At our Analyst Day to dig into the business areas quite a bit more. And we're going to help you understand those. We're going to give you segment reporting that helps you see those and be able to get transparency and accountability through it. But overall, we believe we are laying out a pretty exciting path that the management team, Board of Directors, and our customers are really leaning back into us to say, yes, this is Intel. We're excited for the future. Now is the time. Next question. Overall, we expect that we'll be in a position to gain market share in our existing markets as we're making these capital investments. We've been woefully short of capacity for a number of years. This is great opportunity in the industry. And as everybody in every industry anywhere in the world realizes, semiconductors are hot. We need more of these so we're building the capacity to satisfy that. In the near-term capacity is destiny. Building more capacity enables us to gain more market share. And we think we can do that as our products get stronger with very favorable pricing conditions as well. And for instance, in the client business Alder Lake goes in production, they will be talking more about that next week. A tremendous product that will be a great market share gainer, as well as a pricing leader, right? As well as structured across the segments that allows us to gain share across multiple segments of the client marketplace. Also, I'd point out that these 4 areas, these 4 new growth businesses; we're very small in those businesses today. These have massive growth potential for us large, favorable markets that are looking for leadership, logic, capabilities, that Intel is uniquely positioned to supply into the industry. And overall, clearly the near-term as we've lain out with great transparency, some of the margin impacts in the near-term, but these are great investments. Great investments in large, growing, favorable markets that very few companies have even the opportunity to participate in. And we bring such massive assets to them, that we believe that we're going to be well-positioned to gain leadership positions across networking, accelerated computing, and graphics, in the autonomous vehicle category, in the foundry business. And you combine that with share gaining positions and client to data-center. This is a tremendous period of time. We're seizing the opportunity. Carpe Diem. Very good. Last question. Yes. On Sapphire Rapids, it's exactly what we said back in June of this year, that's -- it's going to be in production in Q1, ramp in Q2. So no change in its timing. We're working through the latter stages of the production process with the design, getting all of the elements of it worked out as we're ready to begin that volume ramp in Q2 of next year and on track for Q1 launch. With respect to the datacenter cloud business in Q3, and we'll see some of this in Q4 as well, largely is exactly what we said. Unique exposure to China where we have uniquely high market share. Nothing else significant going on in that business, that really is the story. Overall, the server business is constrained by supply. And this would be things like [Indiscernible] controllers and power supply devices that are holding us back from achieving, and trust me, we would be shipping a lot more units if we weren't constrained by the supply chain of these other components in the industry. Our customers, both Cloud customers and OEMS, very strong backlogs that they're pressing us aggressively to satisfy. But really limited by these match sets, as we call it in the industry. So other than those 2 factors, China and match sets, everything else is going as expected for the data-center business. So maybe then let me just wrap up our call today by saying, I am so proud of the talented committed team here at Intel. Despite all of the challenges of working through the supply constraints, our teams, our factories, our product designers, the software developers are performing so well. The execution machine that we have is restoring very rapidly and a deep sense of desire that we can, and we will win. I also want to take the chance to personally thank George for his leadership. All the things that he's done for our Company, adjusted commitments, seeing through a smooth transition to his successor. We've taken the first steps of our journey and I can't wait to share more of our successes in the future. Thanks for joining us today."

            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results with revenue up 5% and gross margin up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong demand in our DCG and IOTG businesses, despite the highly constrained, industry-wide supply environment. Q3 revenue was $18.1 billion slightly below our guide due to shipping and supply constraints that impacted our businesses. Demand remains strong in our PC business, with particular strength in commercial, desktop, and higher-end consumer notebooks. Offset by inventory digestion in lower-end consume and education segments. Gross margin for the quarter was 57.8% exceeding guide by 280 basis points, primarily due to an increased mix of desktop and premium notebook products. Q3 EPS was $1.71, up $0.61 versus guide. $0.47 of this beat is predominantly due to a McAfee related special dividend associated with the divestiture of their enterprise business, and a onetime tax benefit. We had a strong operating beat of approximately $0.14 per share as well, largely driven by demand for higher-end products and clients, and lower operating expenses relative to guide. In Q3, we generated $9.9 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $5.9 billion and paid dividends of $1.4 billion, moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was $9.7 billion down 2% year-over-year on a challenging compare and continued industry-wide component shortages that are restricting lower end system sales. Note that when excluding the impact of wrapping down our Apple CPU and motor businesses, CCG revenue is up approximately 10% year-over-year. This highlights the strong execution and underlying demand in our client business platform, ASPs in client were up 9% year-over-year, and 16% sequentially on increased desktop volume and a richer mix of premium notebook products. Operating income was $3.3 billion down $237 million year-over-year, primarily due to increased investments in our technology and product roadmap. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on continued recovery in our enterprise and government segment and isolate ramp. These results were slightly below expectations due to industry-wide component supply constraints that primarily impacted our enterprise customers and areas of softness in PRC, including cloud, as customers adapt to new regulations. Platform ASPs were up 3% year-over-year on improved mix, driven primarily by increased enterprise and government volume. Operating income was $2.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year on higher revenue, partially offset by increased investments in our technology and product roadmap. IOTG achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $1 billion, up 54% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID-driven lows, with particular strength in the industrial and retail segments. Operating margin was $276 million, up 352% year-over-year, returning to pre -COVID levels of profitability. PSG revenue was $478 million, up 16% year-over-year. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply, impacting Q3 results and Q4 forecast. Operating margin was $76 million, up 90% year-over-year. Mobileye revenue was $326 million, up 39% year-over-year, and achieved an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin was $105 million, up 123% year-over-year. Mobileye continues to execute well, winning key designs and rapidly growing revenue and profits. Moving to our Q4 outlook. We are forecasting $18.3 billion in revenue, up $200 million quarter-over-quarter, with DCG seeing modest -- more modest growth than previously expected as China demand and supply challenges persist. CCG is expected to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as strong demand for our higher-end products bolstered by the launch of Alder Lake, are being offset by weaker OEM demand for lower end products as they prioritize their limited component supply to support higher-end system sales. We see our edge businesses continuing to recover year-over-year from COVID -related impacts. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 53.5% unchanged from prior expectation, and continues to include the impact of a one-time charge related to our Intel Federal Business. Excluding this charge, gross margin will be approximately 55% down 3 points quarter-over-quarter on new product ramps and factory start-up charges. We're forecasting EPS of $0.90 per share and a tax rate of 13%. We had previously expected $0.13 of the Q3 ICAP gain, to have occurred in Q4, which accounts for the change from prior Q4 expectations. Turning to our full-year outlook, we are holding revenue guidance at $73.5 billion, with gross margin up modestly to 57% and EPS of $5.28, up $0.48 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect CapEx of $18 to $19 billion and free cash flow of approximately $12.5 billion, up $1.5 billion versus prior guidance. In our CCG business, we expect full-year revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year, as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by the ramp-down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue, and the exit of our home gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple in home gateway business, CCG would've been up approximately 9% year-over-year. For DCG, we expect full-year revenue to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year, due to a more competitive environment consistent with our expectations, lower demand from China, and industry-wide component supply constraints. Before moving on to some comments on our longer-term performance, I want to briefly cover changes to our non-GAAP reporting, beginning in 2022, to more closely align with our semiconductor peers. First, we will be removing stock-based compensation from our operating segment and non-GAAP results. Secondly, we will exclude all gains and losses from our ICAP portfolio. The change that allows better comparability between periods by eliminating large variations in performance, as we saw this quarter. We also expect to align our segment reporting with our announced new business unit configuration. We will have more details on what to expect here next quarter. Moving to long-term financial guidance. As Pat mentioned, with the movement of Investor Day to Q1, we want to provide some insights into the early years of our plan. First, our revenue outlook reflects fundamentally strong TAMs across our operating businesses, with growth driven by our leadership products. We see revenue in 2022 of at least $74 billion despite ongoing supply constraints. As supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products into the marketplace, we expect to see our revenue growth accelerate to a 10% to 12% CAGR over the next four to five years. For gross margin, with the impact of our investment in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, we expect gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next 2-3 years before moving upward. We are in a time of accelerated investment in capital, process node acceleration, and R&D, as the foundation for changing the trajectory of the past few years. In alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are forecasting 2022 CapEx of $25 billion to $28 billion, with potential for further growth in subsequent years. We believe our investments position the Company for very attractive long-term returns. Before I hand off to Q&A, as Pat mentioned, I plan to retire from Intel in May next year. I've been a public Company CFO now for 15 years and it is time for me to spend more time with family and friends as part of the next chapter in my life, it has been a true privilege, and frankly quite exciting to work with Pat and the leadership team on the launch of IDM 2.0, and I look forward to following our transformation over the next several years. There is no Company like Intel. And the immense talent here serves as a wonderful foundation for the transformation ahead. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions. Sure, happy to. The -- we're announcing the accounting change in 2022 just to give people a heads up. It's -- we think it's a pretty modest impact on gross margin. So it works within the range that we've given for the next couple of years. Obviously, we guided the next 2 to 3 years, not 2022. And so Pat did a good job of laying out what are the key drivers there. And the changes that we're doing on the accounting side are really -- we're out of alignment with the industry on stock-based comp. And we're also I think like you probably we just assume not see these large adjustments in a quarter that are for ICAP related activities. And so we're taking that out of non-GAAP as well. Quite frankly, with those two combined, it was net accretive with those two together over the last couple of years. But we think it's the time to make these change. And we think it's consistent with what the industry has done. I would say the other piece is, we saw a bounce up in our network SOCs. And as you know, those have much lower ASPs and tend to be dilutive to ASP. And that was relative to Q2. One is the SOC -- the enterprise piece is as I said, is a mix of products that we saw. It was skewed down from our FCC in the quarter with the enterprise as well. And just for adding clarity, we're -- we expect it to continue in Q4. Yeah. For sure. First off, I think part of the reason for spending this amount of CapEx is to catch up with the capacity shortfalls that we've had. And also to build in more flexibility. These things all support higher revenue over time, which helps absorb some of the depreciation. That being said, it will be growing. No question. Our depreciation impact will be growing over the next couple of years. The impact of o-cost, which is all the Investment that is going on outside of depreciation in the note acceleration that Pat has been talking to, that has a big impact, particularly over the next few years because of the number of nodes that are being worked in parallel. So we think that gets better coming out of this period. And we've had a pretty reasonable assumption inside of our gross margin estimates for how much unit cost are going up, and then how much of that you can recover in ASP. So there's no big missing element. I think it's -- we expect to -- as we've said, we expect to grow into our investment, and we expect the investment in node compression takes less of a toll as we come out of this period. Yeah. And C.J., the accounting changes that we're talking about. Number 1, are to increase transparency into the business by breaking out the segments the way Pat has been describing the segments of the markets that we're going to be addressing. The other changes are really just to align with the industry. So when people look at our non-GAAP numbers, they are going to see the same basis for that as most of our peers. And so no accounting changes that we're talking about that relate to how we treat depreciation of assets. 51% to 53% for the next 2-3 years. And really the biggest hitters being the impact of higher capital, which we see accelerating in Q4 this year, going into next year and then the effect of the multiple node compression. Those are the key dynamics that we see. So that's all we can guide at this point."

Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. It's a thrilling time for both the semiconductor industry and for Intel. We're seeing unprecedented demand as the digitization of everything is accelerated by the superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, and increasingly ubiquitous compute. Our breadth and depth of software, silicon, and platforms, and packaging and process, combined with our at-scale manufacturing, uniquely positions Intel to capitalize on this vast growth opportunity.  Our Q2 results, which exceeded our top and bottom line expectations, reflect the strength of the industry, the demand for our products, as well as the superb execution of our factory network. As I've said before, we are only in the early innings of what is likely to be a decade of sustained growth across the industry.  Our momentum is building, as we once again beat expectations and raise our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. Just laying out our IDM 2.0 strategy in March, we feel increasingly confident that we're moving the Company forward toward our goal of delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. While we have work to do, we are making strides to renew our execution machine. 7-nanometers is progressing very well.  We've launched new innovative products, established Intel Foundry Services, and made operational and organizational changes to lay the foundation needed to win in the next phase of our Company's great history. Here at Intel, we're proud of our past, pragmatic about the work ahead, but most importantly, confident in our future. Now, let me share some more detail on what we're seeing in the market. As compute is becoming more ubiquitous, we're seeing sustained strength in client demand.  The ecosystem is back to shipping over 1 million PC units a day despite grappling with component shortages. I expect PC TAM growth will continue in 2022 and beyond, driven by 3 factors. First, PC density, or PCs per household, is increasing as COVID has irreversibly changed the way we work, learn, connect, and care for each other. For example, even as we emerge from COVID, we're seeing many companies opt for hybrid work models versus full return to the office. Second, replacement cycles are shortening on a larger and aging installed base.  The shift to Notebooks, the deployment of new operating systems and new better experiences such as our Evo platform, will continue to drive refresh on the 400 million PCs over 4 years old, that are running Windows 10. Finally, new markets and users are adopting the PC as the device of choice, and penetration rates are increasing as worldwide GDP growth makes the PC more affordable to more people. In areas like education, we see huge potential as the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers remains in the single-digits. These trends underpin my belief that we are still in the early stages of a sustainable cycle of PC growth.  In our OEM, end channel partners have resoundingly affirmed this perspective. Beyond client, we are seeing near-term recovery across traditional datacenter market, as well as explosive long-term demand from the cloud to the intelligent edge. Our digital society is creating data at an unspeakable pace, and AI is the key to unlocking the value from this data and turning it into information.  As the appetite for meaningful data grows and the cost of compute falls, AI workloads are proliferating into more areas. And as a result, we expect the AI market to grow at more than 20% a year. This is why we are infusing AI across everything we do. Similar revolutions are occurring in the areas of connectivity where the data center will be transformed by silicon photonics and 5G, which is hitting its stride with Open RAN and in autonomous driving, all markets in which we have substantial leadership positions.  On the other side of the equation, a strong demand environment continues to stress the supply chain. While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another 1 to 2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. IDM 2.0, which combines our internal manufacturing capacity with the use of third-party foundries, best positions us to weather these challenges and work with our ecosystem partners to build a more resilient supply chain.  With major FAB Construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel, we are investing for the future, but we are also taking action today to find innovative ways to help mitigate industry constraints. For example, on our Q1 call, I talked about using our internal assembly test network to help with portions of the substrate manufacturing process, a benefit uniquely enabled by our IDM 2.0 strategy. I am pleased to say that this effort is now online and is significantly accelerating the availability of millions of substrates for our products.  We are also working to build the EUV ecosystem which requires significant support around the equipment, including photoresis, mass generation, and metrology. A great example is IMS Nanofabrication, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. Using a novel multi-beam technology, IMS provides the large majority of EUV mask writing tools to the industry, and we plan to accelerate investments to advance this pivotal ecosystem capability. In the second quarter, we continue to see Intel Foundry services build momentum.  We are now engaged with more than 100 potential customers on the basis of our 3 key value propositions. First, IFS will have the widest offering of IP ranging from x86 to ARM to RISC-V, which allows our customers the flexibility to design products using our IP catalog, as well as their own. Second, we will offer our customers comprehensive access to a range of mature and leading edge process and packaging capabilities.  I am pleased to announce we recently signed our first major Cloud customer to use IFS packaging solutions. I'll have even more news to share on IFS customer momentum on Monday. Third, IFS will offer scale manufacturing that gives our customers confidence we can meet their demand. As part of that, we are committed to creating a more robust, geographically balanced, and secure supply chain.  Along with our $20 billion FAB investment in Arizona, and $3.5 billion advanced packaging investment in New Mexico, we plan to build additional capacity to support both internal and IFS growth. The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is a tremendous step forward, to catalyze investments in manufacturing, here in the U.S., and will serve as a tailwind to our IFS efforts. After my recent visit to Europe, we're seeing similar enthusiasm from E.U. governments, customers, and overall ecosystem. And we expect to announce our plans for our next U.S. and European sites by the end of this year.  Moving to our continued focus on execution. As I said at the start of the call, we are pragmatic about the work in front of us, but supremely confident of our future. Under IDM 2.0, our factory network continues to deliver and we are now manufacturing more 10-nanometer wafers than 14-nanometer. As 10-nanometer volumes ramp, economics are improving with 10-nanometer wafer cost 45% lower year-over-year with more to come. We will talk more about our plans for process and packaging leadership in our Intel Accelerated event this Monday.  I hope you will join me for the critical update. On our path back to unquestioned product leadership, customers continue to choose Intel. Using our broad portfolio of assets, we will continue to compete aggressively for market segment share. In Q1, we gained PC share with record notebook sales, following that with record Q2 revenue. We launched 12 new processors and Tiger Lake is ramping even better than expected with more than 50 million units shipped to-date.  Finally, our future client roadmap remains strong and we expect to ship several million units of Alder Lake to customers in the second half, and Meteor Lake remains on track for production in 2023. Beyond the CPU, we reached a major milestone with our partners at Microsoft with the announcement of Windows 11. We deepened our co-engineering efforts to enable new experiences, including running Android applications seamlessly on PCs and optimize for Intel-based platforms.  We're gaining similar momentum through the year in the datacenter. Q1 was the low point in revenue for the year and we exceeded our plan in Q2. We expect DCG to grow sequentially, achieving double-digit year-on-year growth in the second half as it accelerates through the year.  Ice Lake is ramping broadly to customers, including Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Oracle, and other major service providers and Enterprise customers. Additionally, we continue to extend our leadership and networking by delivering a truly cloud agnostic platform using Xeon scalable processors and accelerators in partnership with Ericsson. This will allow operators like Verizon to introduce a virtualized RAN solution across all deployment scenarios, including existing footprints.  Finally, Mobileye further solidified its position as the leading supplier of advanced driver assistance platforms. In Q2, we announced a major win with Toyota and closed 10 additional design wins for over 16 million total lifetime units. Earlier this week, we hit another exciting milestone as Mobileye became the first industry player to start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City, a challenging driving environment for humans, let alone AVs. With vehicles in Israel, Germany, Detroit, Tokyo, Shanghai, and coming soon to Paris, Mobileye has the largest global footprint in the AV industry, enabled by our unique REM distributed mapping technology.  By year-end, we will have over 1 million vehicles providing telemetry for dynamic crowd-source mapping, a unique and powerful advantage of Mobileye. At Intel, we have a saying, \"We begin with sand and the rest is our people.\" At no other point in our history have our people and culture been more important to our success. We recently made strategic organizational changes to further strengthen our technology leadership and accelerate our execution.  We have restructured our data platform group into 2 business units: the Data Center and AI Group, led by Sandra Rivera, an Intel veteran with deep knowledge of data center silicon and software, and the Network and Edge Group, which will be led by Nick McKeown, a renowned leader in the networking industry. We have also created the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group, led by Raja Koduri, to increase the Company's focus in key growth areas of high performance computing and graphics. We're also highly encouraged to have Shlomit Weiss rejoin to strengthen our design engineering core.  Finally, Greg Lavender, who joins as Intel CTO and GM of our software and advanced technology group, will drive a unified vision for our software strategy across Intel and assure it remains a competitive differentiator for us. I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team to drive the future of Intel. Together, we will continue to sharpen our focus and execution, accelerate innovation, and unleash the talent inside Intel. While there's more work ahead, we are moving at a torrid pace and I look forward to providing several updates in the coming months.  On Monday, I invite you to attend Intel Accelerated, where we will lay out our roadmap to regain process performance leadership, and share what comes next for our world-class packaging technologies. In October, we will hold our Intel Innovation Event, a geek fest for the industry to come together and explore the technology that will drive the next decade and beyond.  Finally, at our Investor Day on November 18th, we'll pull it all together and present a compelling long-term business plan to drive sustained growth and shareholder value creation. As you can see, we have a lot playing for the rest of the year. But for now, I'll turn it over to George to discuss our Q2 performance and outlook.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Pat. And good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, we had a very strong Q2, and are raising full-year revenue guidance by $1 billion despite a highly constrained supply environment. Q2 revenue was $18.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $700 million. This upside was led by continued strength in our PC business and earlier-than-expected recovery in both our IOTG business and the enterprise portion of the data center segment. The PC and Mobileye businesses both achieved record Q2 revenue.  Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, exceeding guide by 220 basis points, primarily due to improved mix and strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q2 EPS was $1.28. up $0.23 versus guide, largely on strong operational performance across the board. In Q2, we generated $8.7 billion of cash from operations. Free cash flow of $5.1 billion, and paid dividends of $1.4 billion. Moving to segment performance in the quarter. DCG revenue was $10.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year.  The growth of our core client business is up 14%, when we exclude the impact of the ramping down Apple modem business and the exit of our home gateway business. This shows the strong underlying growth in our client business despite a supply constrained environment. Platform ASPs in client were up 4% sequentially on richer mix within notebook and increased desktop volume.  On a year-over-year basis, the strength in consumer entry and education led to lower overall ASPs. Operating income was $3.8 billion up 32% year-over-year on higher revenue, lower inventory reserves, and reduced 10-nanometer costs. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion exceeding our expectations, but down 9% year-over-year versus a challenging compare and a continued competitive environment.  Sequentially, DCG grew 16% with all segments growing quarter-over-quarter, and Enterprise returning to year-over-year growth. Operating income was $1.9 billion, down 37% year-over-year, primarily on lower revenue, the 10-nanometer production ramp, and increased R&D investment. IoTG revenue was $984 million, up 47% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID - driven loss, and up 8% quarter-over-quarter, led by strength in the retail segment.  Operating margin was $287 million, up 310% year-over-year, returning to pre-COVID levels of profitability. Mobileye revenue was $327 million, up 124% year-over-year, but down sequentially due to COVID related slowdowns at automotive OEM s. Operating margin was $109 million. Mobileye continues to execute extremely well, and we are seeing continued design win momentum. DSG revenue was $486 million, down 3% year-over-year due to significant supply constraints. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply for FPGA s. Operating margin was $82 million, up 3% year-over-year.  Moving to our Q3 and full-year outlook. For Q3, we are guiding revenue of $18.2 billion, up 5.4% year-over-year. We remain in a highly constrained environment where we are unable to fully supply customer demand. In CCG, we continue to see very strong demand for our client products and expect TAM growth to continue. However, persistent industry-wide component in substrate shortages are expected to lower CCG revenues sequentially. We expect supply shortages to continue for several quarters, but appear to be particularly acute for clients in Q3. In data center, we expect enterprise and government, and Cloud to show further recovery in Q3.  As a result, we expect to see strong year-over-year growth in the quarter. Sequentially, we are expecting modest growth that is expected to accelerate further in Q4. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 55%, down approximately 150 basis points year-over-year, as 7-nanometer gains momentum, and the Meteor Lake pilot line ramps. We're also seeing pre -PRQ reserves on our Alder Lake product. We are forecasting EPS of $1.10 per share, and a tax rate of approximately 4%. The forecast includes approximately $0.10 of 1-time tax benefit from our on-shoring of certain entities as part of our long-term tax planning.  Turning to our full-year outlook. We are raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to $73.5 billion, with gross margin of 56.5% and EPS of $4.80, up $0.20 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect Capex of $19 to $20 billion this year, and free cash flow to be $11 billion up $500 million versus prior expectations.  In our CCG business, we expect full-year revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year, as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by supply constraints and the ramp-down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue, and the exit of our Home Gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple and Home Gateway business, CCG would've been up high single-digits year-over-year.  For DCG, we expect full-year revenue to be slightly down year-over-year, with second half revenue significantly higher than first half, as E&G and Cloud recovers. As a result, we expect Data Center will return to year-over-year growth in both Q3 and Q4. Gross margin % is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to 7-nanometer factory ramp, worsening supply constraints impacting client volume and mix, and a one-time charge in Q4 related to our Intel federal business. For your models, apps and this one-time charge, the implied Q4 gross margin would be approximately flat to Q3.  It is good to remember that our investment in 7-nanometer represents a normal impact to introducing new process technologies. Since April, we have seen supply chain inflation happening faster than we are electing to pass through to our customers, further impacting our second half gross margin outlook. We expect increased R&D through the year as we invest in our roadmap and IDM 2.0 strategy, resulting in year-over-year growth in OpEx, of approximately 10%. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.\nTony Balow: All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just 1 question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce the first caller.\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. Pat, there were some headlines recently about you potentially looking at maybe building out your Foundry business by M&A, and I'm wondering, can you just comment broadly, do you think that M&A would significantly accelerate your Foundry efforts? I know right now you are basically offering the 22-nanometer process, and you probably have to offer more processes to pull those efforts forward. So I'm wondering if you can comment on the headlines that were out there. Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Hey, thanks for the question, Tim, and great to be with you all today. So first I'd say, obviously we can't comment specifically on the speculation that you've been hearing, but feel what I'll say is, we're very happy with the build-out of the IFS business. As you say, it will include mature nodes, our 22 SFL, it will also include our leading edge nodes as well, our packaging offerings. And overall we're just seeing great momentum over a 100 customers in our pipeline. And we fully expect that this is going to be a great business for us.  At this point, we would not say that M&A is critical, but nor would we rule it out. Our view is that industry consolidation is very likely. The intense R&D, the need to move to modern and leading edge nodes, the massive capital investments required, we just simply view that smaller players simply won't be able to keep up, and foundries without leading edge capabilities will be left behind. And we're continually seeking ways to accelerate our plans with IFS. If an acquisition can help, we will certainly not rule it out. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to clarify, George, the one-time charge in Q4, roughly $300 million. Can you give a little more color on that? And then I guess Pat or George, bigger picture question. As you're going through this transformation, IDM 2.0 strategy, is there a free cash flow target that you have in your mind in the coming 1 or 2 years or no? Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: Let me -- I'll start with the one-time charge, without going into too much detail. It is related to our high performance compute activities through our Intel Federal. It's crystallized in Q4 at the time that we execute a contract. So that's the reason for the timing.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And I would just say the HPC business for us, consistent with the reorg that we just announced, C.J., we just see a huge opportunity for us as we start delivering our GPU HPC, specialized versions of the Xeon product. We see a great opportunity. The reorg brings more focus on this business. So even though there is the one-time charge in Q4, we see this as a great business for us for the long term. And one that just will bring many, many technological market and business benefits. So George, I'll let you answer the second half.\nGeorge Davis: In terms of free cash flow, obviously very important. We're focused on that. We've raised it this year, as you saw on the call. We will go through not only free cash flow, but capital and all of the normal key financial metrics for the Company at the November Analyst Meeting. We'll defer until that time on that question, but thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Question, please.\nJohn Pitzer: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Pat, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question just on pricing in the quarter, and your philosophy around pricing. It sounds like within the client business mix explains a lot of the decline in ASPs year-over-year. But when I look at the Data Center Group, especially with enterprise up and calms down year-over-year, I was a little bit surprised to see ASPs in that group down about 7% year-over-year. Can you help us understand what's mix versus like for like? And as you think about regaining product dominance, how do you use pricing to kind of maintain a share as you get your feet back underneath you?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And broadly speaking, my comments will be a little bit specific to start with on the datacCenter business proper. Data center business good, good recovery in Q2. And with that there was some ASP decline, some of that's competitive driven. A little bit of that is mix-driven, but a bit more competitive.  Our outlook there is, is that we see fairly stable pricing and market segment share in the data center business for the second half of the year. And that's driven by, I will just say, we're bringing everything we got to the table to continue to win back the market, and with that, our software resources, our deep investments with our customers, the increasing strength of our product line.  Yeah, I'd also highlight they have a very strong ramp for the Ice Lake product, which is very competitive. Clear leadership on a number of metrics, the critical one such as AI performance. And we're also starting to see the return to growth in Cloud as you note, but stronger growth in the enterprise portion of the market.  Overall, DCG, good growth second half over first half. We'll be very competitive with that business but it's a supply constrained environment overall, which is the similar case for the client business.  Overall, we don't see a lot of movement on ASP first half to second half in either of those businesses. It really is about supply limitations. And as George commented, we're not passing through all of our supply constraint price increases that we're seeing from our supply chain. We really see it as an opportunity to be investing with our customers, rebuilding their confidence and partnership for the future. And we're feeling very good about our overall strength, momentum, and competitiveness as we go into the second half.\nGeorge Davis: And C.J., I would just add. The Q2 number which looks like a double-digit ASP decrease for CCG, I would just remind you that that's a year-over-year comparison where we have a much bigger mix of the small Core products, which is really driving that. You saw units were up 33% and ASPs were down 15%. It's really the mix that is reflected there.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on depreciation. It's been coming down sequentially for the last several quarters. It was actually down again sequentially this quarter. How is that possible given the CapEx ramp? Like what's going on there? And how do we think about depreciation's impact in gross margin going forward, given it's run rating under $10 billion annually and your CapEx is now going to $20 billion annually. Like how do we think about those?\nGeorge Davis: Yes, Stacy, so the absolute numbers are down -- are trending what is counter-intuitively, and really it's NAND moving from non-GAAP into GAAP. There's no depreciation for the NAND business anymore, as it's under the accounting once it's held for sale. It's an anomaly. Yes, we expect depreciation to increase as we're ramping CapEx over the next several years. And again, in terms of how all of that translates into everything from gross margins to free cash flow, we'll cover all that at the Analysts Day. But you're not missing anything.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could address the timing on Sapphire Rapids. There was some stuff on your blog, end of June, that there was a delay. It doesn't sound like from customers, there's been that much of a change. But just maybe from your standpoint, how should we think about the timing of that product and how it affects you over the next 12 months?\nPat Gelsinger: Thanks, Joe. I'll take that one. Overall, as I said, you have the Data Center business strong momentum. And we really felt Q1 is the low point, Q2 gaining momentum, second half Ice Lake ramp being very strong. And obviously customers are now very anxious and excited about Sapphire Rapids' huge performance improvements, but also huge feature capabilities as part of that. So we did add a bit more time for the validation cycle. We are now deep into the validation. It's in the hands of customers with volumes sampling underway.  And they're quite excited about not just the performance capabilities, core count increases, but a lot of the new technologies in the area of new memory capabilities, new PCI, Gen 5 capabilities, many of the new features that we've brought in here for AI performance in particular. Overall, it's going to be a great product and we're expecting to see a very strong ramp of it in the first half of next year. And this, we think, will just continue to build the momentum of the Data Center business as we've indicated strong second half as forecast, and we're going to build on that as we go into the next year with Sapphire Rapids. And the overall roadmap execution is improving, as we look for '23 and '24 to deliver unquestioned leadership product across everything that we do, including the Data Center.\nJoe Moore: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Back one more on the Foundry business. We have heard that Intel commit, I think 20 billion to the U.S. Foundry over the next several years, another 20 billion to Foundry operations in Europe. I'm curious when that spending is going to start, and importantly, who are the target customers? Because when I look at the fabulous landscape, it's not the cloud vendors who are the large fabless customers. It's Apple, it's Qualcomm, it's NVIDIA, Marvell, AMD, etc. Many of them compete against Intel. I'm curious, who is -- who are the target customers here that can justify this nearly 40 billion of spending that Intel is committing to from a Foundry perspective? Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. Vivek, this is George. A couple of things. Number 1, we're short of supply, so we're the first big customer going into that expanded capacity, and we'll open up those facilities, getting the shells, and what I would call the lower-cost elements in place, is something that quite frankly we'd fallen behind on over the last few years. So this is -- we're playing a little catch-up just for our own requirements. With Foundry, we'll be talking about some potential customers. We've talked about 100 customers that are talking to us about Foundry opportunities.  Obviously, when you bring on a new Foundry customer, as you look at the lead times that are needed for that and the lead times that are needed to actually do the most expensive part of adding to your capacity, those things actually line up pretty well, so we'll manage that, manage that quite tightly. We'll go into this in more detail in November, but it's not a -- this is not intended to be a, we'll just keep building and hoping that somebody shows up. It's going to be tied to the demand signals that we're receiving. And that, not only for us, which are significantly in excess of our capacity today, but also for the customers we're working with, which I believe we'll be talking about more next week at our event.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And just to add, Vivek, we'll cover some more of this on Monday in our Intel Accelerated event. And as part of that, we'll be laying out more specifics on the roadmap, the process, the packaging. But I'll say to the core of your question was, who's going to be the customers for this? We expect a broad range of customers. We're going to have a range of offerings on the menu, if you could, for modern nodes as well as leading edge nodes. We expect a range of customers across different segments of the marketplace, including some of the largest users of wafer capacity in the industry.  There's a lot of excitement in the marketplace, 100+ customers in the pipeline already, and you can expect to see great things in this area of a new and exciting business. The world needs more semiconductors. The world needs a more balanced geographic supply chain for those semiconductors. And we're finding enormous momentum and enthusiasm for that strong support from the customers, the ecosystem, as well as the governments around the world.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.\nMatt Ramsay: Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Pat, I was really pleased to see you guys announce that Greg was going to come join you as CTO. I don't know how many of the semiconductor folks are familiar with his background. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about what, as CTO, is going to be under Greg's remit. I know you guys have had this one API software strategy for a while that looks great in slides and on paper, but we've not seen a ton from it. If you could expand a little bit about what's exactly going to be under Greg's remit and what he is going to be charged with, that would be really helpful. Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Thank you, Matt. And Greg will be CTO -- the Company's CTO. So as part of that remit will be all of our labs' advanced research capabilities. We have a pool of hundreds of PHD's doing advanced research and some of the most leading-edge work is done. And as you probably know about Greg as well, he was a UT professor and was my CTO at VMware. He will also be the leader of all of our central software activities. And this is a large organization. It's bios, drivers, compilers, all of those core things, and the One API initiative which we're now starting to see major partners come and align with us around One API.  The third and maybe most important area under his remit will be standardizing the upper layers of the software stack for us. And in particular the AI software offerings deal for us. And this is an area that we have, you all say, not managed well. We've had too many pieces in different portions of the organization, so he will become the AI software leader at scale for us in an area that's going to be critical to standardize, deliver, and just deliver some of the world-leading research that we have in the area of our software remit for our AI product offerings overall.  Super excited to have him on the team, a world-class technologist and software leader combining with another world-class leader like Nick McKeown, a world-class leader like Shlomit Weiss coming back on the team for our engineering, talent flow, was going out of the Company; it is now coming back to the Company. And we are excited about the leadership team that we are forming.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your question, please.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On your Data Center business, good to see the sequential inflection in Q2. Looking into the second half in your guidance for Q3 and Q4, it looks like DCG is going to grow double digits percentage year-over-year in the second half. And then that would imply that your Data Center business is growing double digit second half versus first half of this year. Is the math roughly correct in addition to cloud and hyperscale spending reacceleration and improving enterprise? Does the team continue to see strength in service provider as well, as your customers continue to build out their 5G networks?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, yes, and yes to your question, Harlan. And we're really -- the first half, second half, year-over-year, you got it. We're seeing the growth for it. And like we said, we saw the bottom in Q1, great Q2, momentum continuing into the second half and next year. And we saw strong growth in enterprise and government, recovery in Cloud, we're seeing growth in that area.  But as you say -- I'll just say we are so well-positioned on the Edge and the 5G. The open RAN, vRAN initiatives in the industry are now hitting stride. And I think I've only been on 3 major service provider calls this week on exactly that topic, where they are really starting to look at those deployments at scale for a standardized software-driven Edge environment for their 5G networks. And I'd also say, this is a victory for innovation.  Just a year ago, we were very -- just 3 years ago there was grave geopolitical concerns around 5G and would there ever be flexibility for how that would get deployed nationally. Now, everybody is aligning against the O-RAN, vRAN initiatives as the way to do their 5G broad deployments. And the Intel platform sits in the center of those almost everywhere in the world. It really is a great success story for us and one that we think that we'll be harvesting from many, many years to come.\nHarlan Sur: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nToshiya Hari: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a multi-part question on gross margin. George, you talked about PRQ reserves related to Alder Lake being a headwind this quarter. If you can quantify that for us, ballpark, that would be super helpful. And then towards the end of your remarks, in terms of the second half outlook in terms of gross margin, you talked about supply tightness driving a deterioration in CCG mix. I was a little surprised to hear that, given how strong Chromebooks were in the first half. If you can elaborate on that, that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: In terms of -- if we're looking at the particularly -- let's just look at Q3, because that's where we discussed Alder Lake pre-RQ reserves. It's one of the two top movers when you look at being down 400 basis points, it's certainly, it's not the majority, but it's a meaningful impact in the quarter. 7-nanometer startup cost ramping is the biggest impact far and away.  In terms of supply tightness, the challenge is, part of what made Q2 so great was customers really challenged our sales teams and our factories to remix within a quarter to provide them with the components that they could then match with what their supply chain was providing them so they could get to market. Watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times, but the team did a fantastic job.  We did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3. The supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards, so that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability -- and a higher mix, and that could well be the case.  We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge, it's acute. But Q4, we're doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do with an IDM. If we have more success than we can forecast today, maybe Q4 could be seen as conservative.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. Your question, please.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Just to follow-up to the previous question, George. Could you give us some idea as we head into the next year, what are some of the puts and takes on the gross margin front? I'm just curious as to how long the 7-nanometer cost will persist, and when do they peak out? And as we go into first half of next year, how should we think about the gross margins?\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. Again, I'm going to defer any kind of forecasting of '22 and beyond. But as you know, the fact that we have the 7-nanometer startup ramping is a good sign that we're getting close to being able to get products ramping, and that's what really drives down cost over time. I think Pat was talking about the Q2 or Q2 of 47% reduction in wafer costs in 10-nanometer. That's the kind of benefit you can get as you ramp into a process. We'll lay out more of our thinking in that regard later.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your question, please.\nTristan Gerra: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on the substrates commentary during the Q&A. Is this something that you believe can actually help you competitively as you ramp substrate manufacturing in-house, particularly if supply constraints continue in the first half of next year?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah, we do think it generally moderates market share movements in the industry period. And if anything, we're able to use it as an advantage because we are able to pull some of those substrate steps. just to be clear, we're still relying on our substrate network, but we're pulling some of the backend processing into our own factories, which allows us to essentially get more out of the capacity that's available in the industry. And that's what's enabling us to, I'll say, continue to overachieve on the overall market share gains that we've been seeing.  This has been an important factor. We do have -- some of that factored into our second half. We do hope to continue to overachieve in that area. And if I'd say, why did we overachieve so much in Q2? The heroes for the quarter for us were our manufacturing and operations team. They just did a superb job for us, and really relying on them from the second half, and as George said, hey, if there's more opportunity for us to overachieve on the guide that we set for the second half, it's going to come at the hands of their ability to essentially create more out of nothing; find capacity in the industry, build it out.  And we're doing quite well in this respect, but overall, it is a constrained environment. And as a result, we and everybody else, we're trying to drive our factories harder, drive yields better, and be able to improve the supply chain of the industry. And we're quite excited about the enthusiasm we see in this consistent strong demand signal, as the world becomes more digital. And we're going to be building our internal factories rapidly, our supply chains rapidly, and working with our supply chain quite aggressively.\nTristan Gerra: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to turn to the profitability side of things, and specifically on DCG and the operating margin there. It's great to see that it improved from first quarter to second quarter. And given the revenue trajectory, I would assume it would improve again in the back half of the year.  But kind of trough to trough 2018 of digestion period to this most recent one, the operating margin is about 10 points lower, mid-20s roughly versus mid-30s prior. And I really wanted to understand, why is it lower this time? And perhaps even much more importantly, going forward, is there anything structurally that is going to stop that from returning back to the 40% to 50% operating margin range you guys have historically driven. Competitive dynamics, need to catch up on the manufacturing side, so you have headwinds there. People customizing more cloud competition internally, any of those dynamics that would stop you from getting back to that range? Thanks.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah, thanks. Maybe starting at the latter part of your question. There's no long-term reason why you could not see DCG return to more historical margins. What you're seeing today is a reflection of a couple of things. First off, year-over-year, you've got significant factory start-up costs embedded for them which as you look at our operating margin. I would say another thing that people maybe are overlooking is our OpEx investments. We have significantly increased the OpEx and key areas of the Company even as we've taken down about $2 billion of OpEx since 2018 on various Portfolio actions.  And the DCG and the Xeon product line is absolutely critical to the Company. And so we have substantially increased OpEx within that as well, so that's the second largest impact. and we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's needed. And as you know, ultimately, it is your product competitiveness that gives you more flexibility to drive up ASPs further from today and drive higher gross margins. But I think the early comparison this year were just off as such a strong comparement. The first half of last year was just super strong, high XCC account quarters. And in the first half of this year, although Q2, quite frankly, it was a lot better than we thought coming into it for DCG, on strength in enterprise. But the comparisons year-over-year were quite tough.  As you noted, it's coming up and yes, 7-nanometer start-up is going to be -- got to be absorbed in the higher OpEx, but I think, as you see, our product portfolio continue to get stronger and stronger with Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids, and then for the generations after that. there's no reason why over time, we don't get back to historic levels.\nPat Gelsinger: And I'd also just add 1 small point that the IFS gives us the opportunity to co-engineer with our largest customers. And this in fact creates a unique competitive differentiation where our IP with their IP is creating products that are very uniquely beneficial to their TCO and very co-engineered, so very sticky for both of us. And the example customer that we said of a very large cloud customer as one of our IFS early customers is an example of that kind of co-engineering that we expect that we'll be doing at scale for that portion of the marketplace pretty uniquely.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Thank you. Pat, I just wanted to get back to the competitive environment and just trying to connect all the dots. So in your slide deck for second quarter, you said that the ASPs are down and you referred to an increasingly competitive environment in servers. But in response to one of the questions earlier on, you said you expect a more stable share and pricing environment in DCG. And then the final thing that caught my attention was on the substrate side, you said you're leveraging that backend to moderate market shares. So is that true for the -- did I get that correct? That the environment -- competitive environment will be stable versus what it was in the second quarter? And then, is the substrate also enabling your captive footprint in the backend is allowing you to probably stabilize share losses in the data center side as well? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: The comment on fairly stable market segment share and ASP for DCG for the second half of the year is what our expectations are. I'll just say, I think that the substrate and the overall supply limitations keeps, I'll say, a bound on market share movements in that area, the business overall. We do think incrementally, our IDM capabilities give us a bit more capacity.  And we saw market share gains, for instance, in the first half of the year in the client business as a result of that, and we do think that gives us some ability to hopefully do a bit better than we've even guided, with if it occurs. But overall, yeah, your question's in the right domain. Fairly stable ASPs, fairly stable market segment share in the data center in the second half of the year, which as we've already said, is substantially improved from last year as well as from the first half of this year.  Products are getting more competitive. Stronger products give us more ASP capabilities as they become more competitive. But overall, we're feeling like the bottom was Q1, Q2 showed that to be the case even a bit above our expectations and we're on a great trajectory for the second half and into next year.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you. Well, I think we'll wrap up at this point. And before we sign off, one last opportunity to say what it is an honor to be back for my dream job to run this iconic Company at this pivotal time in the history of the semiconductor industry. We're rebuilding our heritage of execution, innovation and growth, along with the 110,000 talented, passionate Intel employees. I am just absolutely confident that the best days for this Company are ahead of us. Thanks for the call today, and I do look forward to talking to you all at our Intel Accelerated Event on Monday. Talk to you then. Thank you so much.\nTony Balow: Thanks, Pat. Thank you all for joining today. Operator, can you please close the call?\nOperator: Certainly, thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. It's a thrilling time for both the semiconductor industry and for Intel. We're seeing unprecedented demand as the digitization of everything is accelerated by the superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, and increasingly ubiquitous compute. Our breadth and depth of software, silicon, and platforms, and packaging and process, combined with our at-scale manufacturing, uniquely positions Intel to capitalize on this vast growth opportunity.  Our Q2 results, which exceeded our top and bottom line expectations, reflect the strength of the industry, the demand for our products, as well as the superb execution of our factory network. As I've said before, we are only in the early innings of what is likely to be a decade of sustained growth across the industry.  Our momentum is building, as we once again beat expectations and raise our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. Just laying out our IDM 2.0 strategy in March, we feel increasingly confident that we're moving the Company forward toward our goal of delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. While we have work to do, we are making strides to renew our execution machine. 7-nanometers is progressing very well.  We've launched new innovative products, established Intel Foundry Services, and made operational and organizational changes to lay the foundation needed to win in the next phase of our Company's great history. Here at Intel, we're proud of our past, pragmatic about the work ahead, but most importantly, confident in our future. Now, let me share some more detail on what we're seeing in the market. As compute is becoming more ubiquitous, we're seeing sustained strength in client demand.  The ecosystem is back to shipping over 1 million PC units a day despite grappling with component shortages. I expect PC TAM growth will continue in 2022 and beyond, driven by 3 factors. First, PC density, or PCs per household, is increasing as COVID has irreversibly changed the way we work, learn, connect, and care for each other. For example, even as we emerge from COVID, we're seeing many companies opt for hybrid work models versus full return to the office. Second, replacement cycles are shortening on a larger and aging installed base.  The shift to Notebooks, the deployment of new operating systems and new better experiences such as our Evo platform, will continue to drive refresh on the 400 million PCs over 4 years old, that are running Windows 10. Finally, new markets and users are adopting the PC as the device of choice, and penetration rates are increasing as worldwide GDP growth makes the PC more affordable to more people. In areas like education, we see huge potential as the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers remains in the single-digits. These trends underpin my belief that we are still in the early stages of a sustainable cycle of PC growth.  In our OEM, end channel partners have resoundingly affirmed this perspective. Beyond client, we are seeing near-term recovery across traditional datacenter market, as well as explosive long-term demand from the cloud to the intelligent edge. Our digital society is creating data at an unspeakable pace, and AI is the key to unlocking the value from this data and turning it into information.  As the appetite for meaningful data grows and the cost of compute falls, AI workloads are proliferating into more areas. And as a result, we expect the AI market to grow at more than 20% a year. This is why we are infusing AI across everything we do. Similar revolutions are occurring in the areas of connectivity where the data center will be transformed by silicon photonics and 5G, which is hitting its stride with Open RAN and in autonomous driving, all markets in which we have substantial leadership positions.  On the other side of the equation, a strong demand environment continues to stress the supply chain. While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another 1 to 2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. IDM 2.0, which combines our internal manufacturing capacity with the use of third-party foundries, best positions us to weather these challenges and work with our ecosystem partners to build a more resilient supply chain.  With major FAB Construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel, we are investing for the future, but we are also taking action today to find innovative ways to help mitigate industry constraints. For example, on our Q1 call, I talked about using our internal assembly test network to help with portions of the substrate manufacturing process, a benefit uniquely enabled by our IDM 2.0 strategy. I am pleased to say that this effort is now online and is significantly accelerating the availability of millions of substrates for our products.  We are also working to build the EUV ecosystem which requires significant support around the equipment, including photoresis, mass generation, and metrology. A great example is IMS Nanofabrication, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. Using a novel multi-beam technology, IMS provides the large majority of EUV mask writing tools to the industry, and we plan to accelerate investments to advance this pivotal ecosystem capability. In the second quarter, we continue to see Intel Foundry services build momentum.  We are now engaged with more than 100 potential customers on the basis of our 3 key value propositions. First, IFS will have the widest offering of IP ranging from x86 to ARM to RISC-V, which allows our customers the flexibility to design products using our IP catalog, as well as their own. Second, we will offer our customers comprehensive access to a range of mature and leading edge process and packaging capabilities.  I am pleased to announce we recently signed our first major Cloud customer to use IFS packaging solutions. I'll have even more news to share on IFS customer momentum on Monday. Third, IFS will offer scale manufacturing that gives our customers confidence we can meet their demand. As part of that, we are committed to creating a more robust, geographically balanced, and secure supply chain.  Along with our $20 billion FAB investment in Arizona, and $3.5 billion advanced packaging investment in New Mexico, we plan to build additional capacity to support both internal and IFS growth. The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is a tremendous step forward, to catalyze investments in manufacturing, here in the U.S., and will serve as a tailwind to our IFS efforts. After my recent visit to Europe, we're seeing similar enthusiasm from E.U. governments, customers, and overall ecosystem. And we expect to announce our plans for our next U.S. and European sites by the end of this year.  Moving to our continued focus on execution. As I said at the start of the call, we are pragmatic about the work in front of us, but supremely confident of our future. Under IDM 2.0, our factory network continues to deliver and we are now manufacturing more 10-nanometer wafers than 14-nanometer. As 10-nanometer volumes ramp, economics are improving with 10-nanometer wafer cost 45% lower year-over-year with more to come. We will talk more about our plans for process and packaging leadership in our Intel Accelerated event this Monday.  I hope you will join me for the critical update. On our path back to unquestioned product leadership, customers continue to choose Intel. Using our broad portfolio of assets, we will continue to compete aggressively for market segment share. In Q1, we gained PC share with record notebook sales, following that with record Q2 revenue. We launched 12 new processors and Tiger Lake is ramping even better than expected with more than 50 million units shipped to-date.  Finally, our future client roadmap remains strong and we expect to ship several million units of Alder Lake to customers in the second half, and Meteor Lake remains on track for production in 2023. Beyond the CPU, we reached a major milestone with our partners at Microsoft with the announcement of Windows 11. We deepened our co-engineering efforts to enable new experiences, including running Android applications seamlessly on PCs and optimize for Intel-based platforms.  We're gaining similar momentum through the year in the datacenter. Q1 was the low point in revenue for the year and we exceeded our plan in Q2. We expect DCG to grow sequentially, achieving double-digit year-on-year growth in the second half as it accelerates through the year.  Ice Lake is ramping broadly to customers, including Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Oracle, and other major service providers and Enterprise customers. Additionally, we continue to extend our leadership and networking by delivering a truly cloud agnostic platform using Xeon scalable processors and accelerators in partnership with Ericsson. This will allow operators like Verizon to introduce a virtualized RAN solution across all deployment scenarios, including existing footprints.  Finally, Mobileye further solidified its position as the leading supplier of advanced driver assistance platforms. In Q2, we announced a major win with Toyota and closed 10 additional design wins for over 16 million total lifetime units. Earlier this week, we hit another exciting milestone as Mobileye became the first industry player to start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City, a challenging driving environment for humans, let alone AVs. With vehicles in Israel, Germany, Detroit, Tokyo, Shanghai, and coming soon to Paris, Mobileye has the largest global footprint in the AV industry, enabled by our unique REM distributed mapping technology.  By year-end, we will have over 1 million vehicles providing telemetry for dynamic crowd-source mapping, a unique and powerful advantage of Mobileye. At Intel, we have a saying, \"We begin with sand and the rest is our people.\" At no other point in our history have our people and culture been more important to our success. We recently made strategic organizational changes to further strengthen our technology leadership and accelerate our execution.  We have restructured our data platform group into 2 business units: the Data Center and AI Group, led by Sandra Rivera, an Intel veteran with deep knowledge of data center silicon and software, and the Network and Edge Group, which will be led by Nick McKeown, a renowned leader in the networking industry. We have also created the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group, led by Raja Koduri, to increase the Company's focus in key growth areas of high performance computing and graphics. We're also highly encouraged to have Shlomit Weiss rejoin to strengthen our design engineering core.  Finally, Greg Lavender, who joins as Intel CTO and GM of our software and advanced technology group, will drive a unified vision for our software strategy across Intel and assure it remains a competitive differentiator for us. I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team to drive the future of Intel. Together, we will continue to sharpen our focus and execution, accelerate innovation, and unleash the talent inside Intel. While there's more work ahead, we are moving at a torrid pace and I look forward to providing several updates in the coming months.  On Monday, I invite you to attend Intel Accelerated, where we will lay out our roadmap to regain process performance leadership, and share what comes next for our world-class packaging technologies. In October, we will hold our Intel Innovation Event, a geek fest for the industry to come together and explore the technology that will drive the next decade and beyond.  Finally, at our Investor Day on November 18th, we'll pull it all together and present a compelling long-term business plan to drive sustained growth and shareholder value creation. As you can see, we have a lot playing for the rest of the year. But for now, I'll turn it over to George to discuss our Q2 performance and outlook. Hey, thanks for the question, Tim, and great to be with you all today. So first I'd say, obviously we can't comment specifically on the speculation that you've been hearing, but feel what I'll say is, we're very happy with the build-out of the IFS business. As you say, it will include mature nodes, our 22 SFL, it will also include our leading edge nodes as well, our packaging offerings. And overall we're just seeing great momentum over a 100 customers in our pipeline. And we fully expect that this is going to be a great business for us.  At this point, we would not say that M&A is critical, but nor would we rule it out. Our view is that industry consolidation is very likely. The intense R&D, the need to move to modern and leading edge nodes, the massive capital investments required, we just simply view that smaller players simply won't be able to keep up, and foundries without leading edge capabilities will be left behind. And we're continually seeking ways to accelerate our plans with IFS. If an acquisition can help, we will certainly not rule it out. Thank you. Yeah. And I would just say the HPC business for us, consistent with the reorg that we just announced, C.J., we just see a huge opportunity for us as we start delivering our GPU HPC, specialized versions of the Xeon product. We see a great opportunity. The reorg brings more focus on this business. So even though there is the one-time charge in Q4, we see this as a great business for us for the long term. And one that just will bring many, many technological market and business benefits. So George, I'll let you answer the second half. Yeah. And broadly speaking, my comments will be a little bit specific to start with on the datacCenter business proper. Data center business good, good recovery in Q2. And with that there was some ASP decline, some of that's competitive driven. A little bit of that is mix-driven, but a bit more competitive.  Our outlook there is, is that we see fairly stable pricing and market segment share in the data center business for the second half of the year. And that's driven by, I will just say, we're bringing everything we got to the table to continue to win back the market, and with that, our software resources, our deep investments with our customers, the increasing strength of our product line.  Yeah, I'd also highlight they have a very strong ramp for the Ice Lake product, which is very competitive. Clear leadership on a number of metrics, the critical one such as AI performance. And we're also starting to see the return to growth in Cloud as you note, but stronger growth in the enterprise portion of the market.  Overall, DCG, good growth second half over first half. We'll be very competitive with that business but it's a supply constrained environment overall, which is the similar case for the client business.  Overall, we don't see a lot of movement on ASP first half to second half in either of those businesses. It really is about supply limitations. And as George commented, we're not passing through all of our supply constraint price increases that we're seeing from our supply chain. We really see it as an opportunity to be investing with our customers, rebuilding their confidence and partnership for the future. And we're feeling very good about our overall strength, momentum, and competitiveness as we go into the second half. Thanks, Joe. I'll take that one. Overall, as I said, you have the Data Center business strong momentum. And we really felt Q1 is the low point, Q2 gaining momentum, second half Ice Lake ramp being very strong. And obviously customers are now very anxious and excited about Sapphire Rapids' huge performance improvements, but also huge feature capabilities as part of that. So we did add a bit more time for the validation cycle. We are now deep into the validation. It's in the hands of customers with volumes sampling underway.  And they're quite excited about not just the performance capabilities, core count increases, but a lot of the new technologies in the area of new memory capabilities, new PCI, Gen 5 capabilities, many of the new features that we've brought in here for AI performance in particular. Overall, it's going to be a great product and we're expecting to see a very strong ramp of it in the first half of next year. And this, we think, will just continue to build the momentum of the Data Center business as we've indicated strong second half as forecast, and we're going to build on that as we go into the next year with Sapphire Rapids. And the overall roadmap execution is improving, as we look for '23 and '24 to deliver unquestioned leadership product across everything that we do, including the Data Center. Yeah. And just to add, Vivek, we'll cover some more of this on Monday in our Intel Accelerated event. And as part of that, we'll be laying out more specifics on the roadmap, the process, the packaging. But I'll say to the core of your question was, who's going to be the customers for this? We expect a broad range of customers. We're going to have a range of offerings on the menu, if you could, for modern nodes as well as leading edge nodes. We expect a range of customers across different segments of the marketplace, including some of the largest users of wafer capacity in the industry.  There's a lot of excitement in the marketplace, 100+ customers in the pipeline already, and you can expect to see great things in this area of a new and exciting business. The world needs more semiconductors. The world needs a more balanced geographic supply chain for those semiconductors. And we're finding enormous momentum and enthusiasm for that strong support from the customers, the ecosystem, as well as the governments around the world. Yeah. Thank you, Matt. And Greg will be CTO -- the Company's CTO. So as part of that remit will be all of our labs' advanced research capabilities. We have a pool of hundreds of PHD's doing advanced research and some of the most leading-edge work is done. And as you probably know about Greg as well, he was a UT professor and was my CTO at VMware. He will also be the leader of all of our central software activities. And this is a large organization. It's bios, drivers, compilers, all of those core things, and the One API initiative which we're now starting to see major partners come and align with us around One API.  The third and maybe most important area under his remit will be standardizing the upper layers of the software stack for us. And in particular the AI software offerings deal for us. And this is an area that we have, you all say, not managed well. We've had too many pieces in different portions of the organization, so he will become the AI software leader at scale for us in an area that's going to be critical to standardize, deliver, and just deliver some of the world-leading research that we have in the area of our software remit for our AI product offerings overall.  Super excited to have him on the team, a world-class technologist and software leader combining with another world-class leader like Nick McKeown, a world-class leader like Shlomit Weiss coming back on the team for our engineering, talent flow, was going out of the Company; it is now coming back to the Company. And we are excited about the leadership team that we are forming. Yes, yes, and yes to your question, Harlan. And we're really -- the first half, second half, year-over-year, you got it. We're seeing the growth for it. And like we said, we saw the bottom in Q1, great Q2, momentum continuing into the second half and next year. And we saw strong growth in enterprise and government, recovery in Cloud, we're seeing growth in that area.  But as you say -- I'll just say we are so well-positioned on the Edge and the 5G. The open RAN, vRAN initiatives in the industry are now hitting stride. And I think I've only been on 3 major service provider calls this week on exactly that topic, where they are really starting to look at those deployments at scale for a standardized software-driven Edge environment for their 5G networks. And I'd also say, this is a victory for innovation.  Just a year ago, we were very -- just 3 years ago there was grave geopolitical concerns around 5G and would there ever be flexibility for how that would get deployed nationally. Now, everybody is aligning against the O-RAN, vRAN initiatives as the way to do their 5G broad deployments. And the Intel platform sits in the center of those almost everywhere in the world. It really is a great success story for us and one that we think that we'll be harvesting from many, many years to come. Yeah, we do think it generally moderates market share movements in the industry period. And if anything, we're able to use it as an advantage because we are able to pull some of those substrate steps. just to be clear, we're still relying on our substrate network, but we're pulling some of the backend processing into our own factories, which allows us to essentially get more out of the capacity that's available in the industry. And that's what's enabling us to, I'll say, continue to overachieve on the overall market share gains that we've been seeing.  This has been an important factor. We do have -- some of that factored into our second half. We do hope to continue to overachieve in that area. And if I'd say, why did we overachieve so much in Q2? The heroes for the quarter for us were our manufacturing and operations team. They just did a superb job for us, and really relying on them from the second half, and as George said, hey, if there's more opportunity for us to overachieve on the guide that we set for the second half, it's going to come at the hands of their ability to essentially create more out of nothing; find capacity in the industry, build it out.  And we're doing quite well in this respect, but overall, it is a constrained environment. And as a result, we and everybody else, we're trying to drive our factories harder, drive yields better, and be able to improve the supply chain of the industry. And we're quite excited about the enthusiasm we see in this consistent strong demand signal, as the world becomes more digital. And we're going to be building our internal factories rapidly, our supply chains rapidly, and working with our supply chain quite aggressively. And I'd also just add 1 small point that the IFS gives us the opportunity to co-engineer with our largest customers. And this in fact creates a unique competitive differentiation where our IP with their IP is creating products that are very uniquely beneficial to their TCO and very co-engineered, so very sticky for both of us. And the example customer that we said of a very large cloud customer as one of our IFS early customers is an example of that kind of co-engineering that we expect that we'll be doing at scale for that portion of the marketplace pretty uniquely. The comment on fairly stable market segment share and ASP for DCG for the second half of the year is what our expectations are. I'll just say, I think that the substrate and the overall supply limitations keeps, I'll say, a bound on market share movements in that area, the business overall. We do think incrementally, our IDM capabilities give us a bit more capacity.  And we saw market share gains, for instance, in the first half of the year in the client business as a result of that, and we do think that gives us some ability to hopefully do a bit better than we've even guided, with if it occurs. But overall, yeah, your question's in the right domain. Fairly stable ASPs, fairly stable market segment share in the data center in the second half of the year, which as we've already said, is substantially improved from last year as well as from the first half of this year.  Products are getting more competitive. Stronger products give us more ASP capabilities as they become more competitive. But overall, we're feeling like the bottom was Q1, Q2 showed that to be the case even a bit above our expectations and we're on a great trajectory for the second half and into next year. Thank you. Well, I think we'll wrap up at this point. And before we sign off, one last opportunity to say what it is an honor to be back for my dream job to run this iconic Company at this pivotal time in the history of the semiconductor industry. We're rebuilding our heritage of execution, innovation and growth, along with the 110,000 talented, passionate Intel employees. I am just absolutely confident that the best days for this Company are ahead of us. Thanks for the call today, and I do look forward to talking to you all at our Intel Accelerated Event on Monday. Talk to you then. Thank you so much."

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat. And good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, we had a very strong Q2, and are raising full-year revenue guidance by $1 billion despite a highly constrained supply environment. Q2 revenue was $18.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $700 million. This upside was led by continued strength in our PC business and earlier-than-expected recovery in both our IOTG business and the enterprise portion of the data center segment. The PC and Mobileye businesses both achieved record Q2 revenue.  Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, exceeding guide by 220 basis points, primarily due to improved mix and strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q2 EPS was $1.28. up $0.23 versus guide, largely on strong operational performance across the board. In Q2, we generated $8.7 billion of cash from operations. Free cash flow of $5.1 billion, and paid dividends of $1.4 billion. Moving to segment performance in the quarter. DCG revenue was $10.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year.  The growth of our core client business is up 14%, when we exclude the impact of the ramping down Apple modem business and the exit of our home gateway business. This shows the strong underlying growth in our client business despite a supply constrained environment. Platform ASPs in client were up 4% sequentially on richer mix within notebook and increased desktop volume.  On a year-over-year basis, the strength in consumer entry and education led to lower overall ASPs. Operating income was $3.8 billion up 32% year-over-year on higher revenue, lower inventory reserves, and reduced 10-nanometer costs. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion exceeding our expectations, but down 9% year-over-year versus a challenging compare and a continued competitive environment.  Sequentially, DCG grew 16% with all segments growing quarter-over-quarter, and Enterprise returning to year-over-year growth. Operating income was $1.9 billion, down 37% year-over-year, primarily on lower revenue, the 10-nanometer production ramp, and increased R&D investment. IoTG revenue was $984 million, up 47% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID - driven loss, and up 8% quarter-over-quarter, led by strength in the retail segment.  Operating margin was $287 million, up 310% year-over-year, returning to pre-COVID levels of profitability. Mobileye revenue was $327 million, up 124% year-over-year, but down sequentially due to COVID related slowdowns at automotive OEM s. Operating margin was $109 million. Mobileye continues to execute extremely well, and we are seeing continued design win momentum. DSG revenue was $486 million, down 3% year-over-year due to significant supply constraints. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply for FPGA s. Operating margin was $82 million, up 3% year-over-year.  Moving to our Q3 and full-year outlook. For Q3, we are guiding revenue of $18.2 billion, up 5.4% year-over-year. We remain in a highly constrained environment where we are unable to fully supply customer demand. In CCG, we continue to see very strong demand for our client products and expect TAM growth to continue. However, persistent industry-wide component in substrate shortages are expected to lower CCG revenues sequentially. We expect supply shortages to continue for several quarters, but appear to be particularly acute for clients in Q3. In data center, we expect enterprise and government, and Cloud to show further recovery in Q3.  As a result, we expect to see strong year-over-year growth in the quarter. Sequentially, we are expecting modest growth that is expected to accelerate further in Q4. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 55%, down approximately 150 basis points year-over-year, as 7-nanometer gains momentum, and the Meteor Lake pilot line ramps. We're also seeing pre -PRQ reserves on our Alder Lake product. We are forecasting EPS of $1.10 per share, and a tax rate of approximately 4%. The forecast includes approximately $0.10 of 1-time tax benefit from our on-shoring of certain entities as part of our long-term tax planning.  Turning to our full-year outlook. We are raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to $73.5 billion, with gross margin of 56.5% and EPS of $4.80, up $0.20 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect Capex of $19 to $20 billion this year, and free cash flow to be $11 billion up $500 million versus prior expectations.  In our CCG business, we expect full-year revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year, as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by supply constraints and the ramp-down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue, and the exit of our Home Gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple and Home Gateway business, CCG would've been up high single-digits year-over-year.  For DCG, we expect full-year revenue to be slightly down year-over-year, with second half revenue significantly higher than first half, as E&G and Cloud recovers. As a result, we expect Data Center will return to year-over-year growth in both Q3 and Q4. Gross margin % is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to 7-nanometer factory ramp, worsening supply constraints impacting client volume and mix, and a one-time charge in Q4 related to our Intel federal business. For your models, apps and this one-time charge, the implied Q4 gross margin would be approximately flat to Q3.  It is good to remember that our investment in 7-nanometer represents a normal impact to introducing new process technologies. Since April, we have seen supply chain inflation happening faster than we are electing to pass through to our customers, further impacting our second half gross margin outlook. We expect increased R&D through the year as we invest in our roadmap and IDM 2.0 strategy, resulting in year-over-year growth in OpEx, of approximately 10%. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions. Let me -- I'll start with the one-time charge, without going into too much detail. It is related to our high performance compute activities through our Intel Federal. It's crystallized in Q4 at the time that we execute a contract. So that's the reason for the timing. In terms of free cash flow, obviously very important. We're focused on that. We've raised it this year, as you saw on the call. We will go through not only free cash flow, but capital and all of the normal key financial metrics for the Company at the November Analyst Meeting. We'll defer until that time on that question, but thanks. And C.J., I would just add. The Q2 number which looks like a double-digit ASP decrease for CCG, I would just remind you that that's a year-over-year comparison where we have a much bigger mix of the small Core products, which is really driving that. You saw units were up 33% and ASPs were down 15%. It's really the mix that is reflected there. Yes, Stacy, so the absolute numbers are down -- are trending what is counter-intuitively, and really it's NAND moving from non-GAAP into GAAP. There's no depreciation for the NAND business anymore, as it's under the accounting once it's held for sale. It's an anomaly. Yes, we expect depreciation to increase as we're ramping CapEx over the next several years. And again, in terms of how all of that translates into everything from gross margins to free cash flow, we'll cover all that at the Analysts Day. But you're not missing anything. You bet. Yeah. Vivek, this is George. A couple of things. Number 1, we're short of supply, so we're the first big customer going into that expanded capacity, and we'll open up those facilities, getting the shells, and what I would call the lower-cost elements in place, is something that quite frankly we'd fallen behind on over the last few years. So this is -- we're playing a little catch-up just for our own requirements. With Foundry, we'll be talking about some potential customers. We've talked about 100 customers that are talking to us about Foundry opportunities.  Obviously, when you bring on a new Foundry customer, as you look at the lead times that are needed for that and the lead times that are needed to actually do the most expensive part of adding to your capacity, those things actually line up pretty well, so we'll manage that, manage that quite tightly. We'll go into this in more detail in November, but it's not a -- this is not intended to be a, we'll just keep building and hoping that somebody shows up. It's going to be tied to the demand signals that we're receiving. And that, not only for us, which are significantly in excess of our capacity today, but also for the customers we're working with, which I believe we'll be talking about more next week at our event. In terms of -- if we're looking at the particularly -- let's just look at Q3, because that's where we discussed Alder Lake pre-RQ reserves. It's one of the two top movers when you look at being down 400 basis points, it's certainly, it's not the majority, but it's a meaningful impact in the quarter. 7-nanometer startup cost ramping is the biggest impact far and away.  In terms of supply tightness, the challenge is, part of what made Q2 so great was customers really challenged our sales teams and our factories to remix within a quarter to provide them with the components that they could then match with what their supply chain was providing them so they could get to market. Watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times, but the team did a fantastic job.  We did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3. The supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards, so that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability -- and a higher mix, and that could well be the case.  We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge, it's acute. But Q4, we're doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do with an IDM. If we have more success than we can forecast today, maybe Q4 could be seen as conservative. Yeah. Again, I'm going to defer any kind of forecasting of '22 and beyond. But as you know, the fact that we have the 7-nanometer startup ramping is a good sign that we're getting close to being able to get products ramping, and that's what really drives down cost over time. I think Pat was talking about the Q2 or Q2 of 47% reduction in wafer costs in 10-nanometer. That's the kind of benefit you can get as you ramp into a process. We'll lay out more of our thinking in that regard later. Yeah, thanks. Maybe starting at the latter part of your question. There's no long-term reason why you could not see DCG return to more historical margins. What you're seeing today is a reflection of a couple of things. First off, year-over-year, you've got significant factory start-up costs embedded for them which as you look at our operating margin. I would say another thing that people maybe are overlooking is our OpEx investments. We have significantly increased the OpEx and key areas of the Company even as we've taken down about $2 billion of OpEx since 2018 on various Portfolio actions.  And the DCG and the Xeon product line is absolutely critical to the Company. And so we have substantially increased OpEx within that as well, so that's the second largest impact. and we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's needed. And as you know, ultimately, it is your product competitiveness that gives you more flexibility to drive up ASPs further from today and drive higher gross margins. But I think the early comparison this year were just off as such a strong comparement. The first half of last year was just super strong, high XCC account quarters. And in the first half of this year, although Q2, quite frankly, it was a lot better than we thought coming into it for DCG, on strength in enterprise. But the comparisons year-over-year were quite tough.  As you noted, it's coming up and yes, 7-nanometer start-up is going to be -- got to be absorbed in the higher OpEx, but I think, as you see, our product portfolio continue to get stronger and stronger with Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids, and then for the generations after that. there's no reason why over time, we don't get back to historic levels."

Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you for my first earnings call. I consider it an honor to be CEO of this great company. Thanks for joining today. Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottomline driven by exceptional demand for our products and exclusive execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors. Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating and executing. It\u2019s amazing to be back at Intel and Intel is back. Before George takes you through the financial details of the quarter, I will begin with the industry trends we are seeing and why Intel is well-positioned to aggressively capitalize on them. Said simply, Intel is the only company with the depth and breadth of software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process with at-scale manufacturing that customers can depend on for their next-generation innovations. There are four super powers driving digital transformation, cloud, connectivity, artificial intelligence and the intelligent edge. Intel\u2019s mission and we are uniquely positioned to do so, is to help customers harness these super powers to improve the lives of every human on the planet. The digitization of everything was remarkably accelerated by COVID and has spurred innovation and new models of working and learning, interacting and care. Technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence and semiconductors are the foundation. This is creating a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that will result in sustained growth for a decade or more. The PC ecosystem in particular is experiencing resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamic of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012 and that\u2019s continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history. Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, one PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education, where on a global basis, the number of PCs per hundred students and teachers still remains in the single digits. Every student needs a laptop. We have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over four years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity. Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic. As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake H ahead of schedule in 10-nanometers and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14-nanometers in the second half of the year. Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience and we are deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners including Microsoft, Google and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than a million units a day. With over 100 million Xeon servers in the install base, the world runs on Intel. Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry\u2019s broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor code named Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers.  Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application. As the only x86 Data Center CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads and our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, UC San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager super computer. Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye\u2019s assisted driving technology continues to win over auto makers with eight new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with a win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year. We continue to have extraordinary success winning in the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We are already seeing significant adoption of oneAPI and oneAPI power tool kits for high performance computing, AI and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing oneAPI\u2019s open standard space approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors. This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing oneAPI at scale. The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We have doubled our internal wafer capacity the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages. This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel foundry services. Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customer\u2019s surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply. Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It\u2019s a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market. It\u2019s clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services, starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe, while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world. Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services have already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We are seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers. We have been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near- and long-term. We are doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future. We are encouraged by President Biden\u2019s recognition of semiconductor manufacturing as a critical component of our national infrastructure, and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs Plan. Looking ahead, we are confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7-nanometers is progressing well and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply, resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.  By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we will tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year and ramp in the first half of 2022. Overall, our 2023 roadmaps are firm and under execution, and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well underway to provide unquestioned leadership product in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate and the drive that made us great. We are reigniting our culture to attract, retain, and motivate the best and brightest engineers in the industry. In fact, we have onboarded over 2,000 engineers so far this year including the recent key hire of Sanjay Natarajan, who will co-lead our logic technology development. In total, we expect to add several thousand more engineers by the end of the year. 2021 is a pivotal year as we lay the foundation of our winning IDM 2.0 strategy and invest in our future to accelerate our trajectory and execution. Given the incredible demand for computing, the strength of our IDM 2.0 strategy and the technology investments we are making, I am certain Intel\u2019s best days are in front of us.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a stronger than expected start to the year, with both our PC notebook and Mobileye businesses achieving record quarters. Our revenue was $18.6 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.1 billion led by strength in our PC business and the first signs of recovery in the enterprise and government portion of our data center business. Our IoTG, Mobileye and PSG businesses also posted strong sequential growth as they began to emerge from an adverse macroeconomic environment driven by COVID. As noted in our January guidance, Q1 revenue includes an approximately $580 million one-time corporate revenue item.  Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by approximately 40 basis points largely due to flow-through on higher revenue. Q1 EPS was $1.39, up $0.29 versus guide, with the majority of the beat on strong operational performance and the balance on gains related to our ICAP portfolio. Note that these non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a charge related to VLSI litigation that are included in GAAP results. In Q1, we generated $5.5 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. We repurchased $2.4 billion of shares, completing the $20 billion repurchase plan announced in October of 2019. Going forward, we expect to have lower stock repurchases as we enter an investment phase to support strong demand growth in client, build initial infrastructure for future foundry volumes and make necessary investments to accelerate our return to process leadership. We remain committed to growing the dividend. Moving to segment performance in the quarter, CCG revenue was up 8% year-over-year, driven by all-time record notebook unit volumes, up 54% year-over-year. Increased volume in the consumer entry and education segments resulted in platform ASPs being down 20% year-over-year. Excluding this upside volume, ASP\u2019s were flat year-over-year. Combined with growth in our Wi-Fi and Thunderbolt connectivity businesses, revenue grew overall in CCG despite the ramp-down of our modem and Mac sales, and the impact of exiting our connected home division.  Operating income was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year on higher 10-nanometer mix and increased R&D investment. DCG delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, somewhat above our expectations, but down 20% year-over-year on a challenging compare. Enterprise and government saw initial recovery with sequential performance above seasonal expectations, while cloud inventory digestion persisted through the quarter as expected. Strong network SoC growth and products mix drove more than half of the 14% year-over-year ASP decline. DCG operating income in Q1 was down $2.2 billion year-over-year on lower revenue, transition to 10-nanometer and increased R&D investment in our Xeon roadmap. Our Intelligent Edge businesses were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as COVID-related demand impacts began to subside. Specifically, IoTG revenue was up 18% quarter-over-quarter with strength in retail and industrial segments. Mobileye revenue and operating margin were both all-time records at $377 million and $147 million, respectively. Mobileye continues to execute well and gain market segment share as the auto industry recovers from pandemic lows. DSG revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter with strength in its communications and embedded segments. Moving to our Q2 and full year outlook. For Q2, we are guiding revenue of $17.8 billion, down 2% year-over-year excluding our NAND business. We continue to see very strong demand for PCs, with fulfillment challenges on industry-wide component and substrate shortages. In data center, we believe revenue bottomed in Q1 and will increase in Q2 as cloud digestion impacts begin to subside, and enterprise and government momentum continues.  Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, up approximately 1 point year-over-year, driven by lower inventory reserves and improved 10-nanometer costs, partially offset by factory start-up costs. We are forecasting EPS of $1.05 per share and a tax rate of 13%. For full year, we are increasing our guidance provided in March, now forecasting $72.5 billion in revenue, up $500 million from our prior guidance, gross margin of 56.5% and EPS at $4.60, up $0.05 from our March 23 call. We now expect free cash flow to be $10.5 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations. We continue to see very strong PC demand with both TAM and our internal PC supply growing double-digits year-over-year, but we expect CCG revenue to be more first-half-weighted than normal seasonality due to industry-wide supply constraints and the continuing ramp-down of modem and Apple Mac revenue. In data center, we expect increased demand in the second half as both cloud, enterprise and government segments return to growth. Gross margin percent will be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to increased 7-nanometer start-up costs and industry-wide supply constraints impacting client volume and mix. We expect increased R&D throughout the year as we invest in our roadmap and IDM 2.0 strategy. As stated in March, this guide is tempered by DCG-related entity list uncertainty and industry-wide supply constraints, primarily impacting our client, IoTG and PSG businesses. We are working closely with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique IDM capabilities to mitigate these supply constraints, gaining market segment share and outperform this guide. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.\nTony Balow: All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question. Operator, please go ahead and introduce the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may begin.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and nice job on the quarterly execution. It was good to see the unveiling of the IDM 2.0 strategy back in March. It was also good to get the 7-nanometer update and continued execution on getting that ramped in 2023. But that\u2019s just a point milestone, right? So in order to sustain your technology and performance leadership with the IDM 2.0 strategy, it\u2019s going to require the means to maintain a cadence on both intranode optimization, but also more importantly to maintain a cadence of continued node strength to 5-nanometer and then ultimately to 3-nanometer. I think the Intel team had previously articulated node migrations kind of every two, two and a half years. Pat, I think you said, a yearly cadence back in March, but I assume that that was internode optimization. But on the move to 7 to 5, can we expect the team to ramp 5-nanometers two, two and a half years after your 7-nanometer ramp and then 3-nanometer ramp two, two and a half years after 5?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Hey. Thank you for the question, Harlan. And overall as I said on the call, we are seeing very good progress on the 7-nanometer team. They are executing now. We are very confident with the changes that we made on that and the move to really embrace EUV and since we have done that we have just seen superb execution. And as I said in the unleashed event, we expect to move to a yearly cadence or better for our process technology, and we are going to be laying that path out very clearly. We are excited about our team\u2019s ability to get us back to process parity and ultimately to sustained leadership yet again. And I am very happy with the team and some of the investments we are making. The hiring of Sanjay Natarajan that we talked about, the team is getting fired up to execute on that. We also see, this is just one piece of our technology leadership strategy and as we have seen in the IDM 2.0 strategy, it\u2019s about packaging. It\u2019s about the process. It\u2019s about the full set of IP that we are bringing to the table and at-scale manufacturing and I will say some of the early enthusiasm that we have seen from some of the foundry customer pipeline is really bringing together our packaging technology with the full IDM 2.0 strategy. So, overall, getting back to the heart of your question, exactly. We are going to increase the cadence of our process technology innovations. We are seeing very positive signs since we made this change and we are on track to parity and again sustained leadership out in the future. Our team is firing on all cylinders and I am excited about what we are seeing as we monitor those milestones very rigorously going forward. This team is on fire and we are executing.\nHarlan Sur: Great. Thank you.\nTony Balow: Operator, next question. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may begin.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-on question Pat to your foundry strategy or IDM 2.0 strategy. I get the vision of gaining scale by investing for yourselves at the leading edge and then backfilling fully depreciated capacity in the 22-nanometer and 10-nanometer nodes over time and the benefit to you guys. But what\u2019s the benefit of opening up the business at the leading edge to foundry customers and how are you going to cajole folks to redesign to your design, and will you have to subsidize them or will that be a subsidy that comes from the U.S. Government? I would love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Overall, let\u2019s just paint the picture a little bit more broadly, C.J. and thanks for the question. On the IDM 2.0 strategy, we are all about making leading edge capacity available for our foundry customers. And the world needs more leading edge capacity and there\u2019s very few companies that can supply it around the world. So we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm for that. It\u2019s going to cause us to build and expand our capacity more aggressively. And as you suggest, it also means we have a better monetization on the longer life cycle of the foundry business and we are planning on getting to foundry kind of margins with that investment. Now, as we have already begun engaging with customers, we have seen enthusiasm, right? We have seen enthusiasm that they get to design on our leading process technology and they have more choices for where that might be coming from. We are also seeing enthusiasm for this idea that they can bring some of their IP and bring our IP to the table, and in particular some of the cloud customers have been very excited about that ability to say, hey, I can take some of my cool ideas and be better optimized and including things like x86 Cores to have a more optimized solution for their market requirements. This is compelling for them. And then we combine that with all the other strengths that we have talked about such as at-scale manufacturing and in a supply constrained environment like we are in right now, boy, that\u2019s bringing enthusiasm from customers. Also, we get to do that with all of the other assets that we have with packaging, our software technology. We think this is a strategy that will be very powerful for the industry and we have seen that response from early customers, the EDA tool chains, the IP suppliers. This is really hit the right time in the industry. And we are seeing the international aspects as well as the government aspect saying, yeah, we need a more geographically disbursed resilient supply chain for something that\u2019s critical to the future of humanity and semiconductor technology. This is the right strategy for the right time and we are seeing great response from it.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nTony Balow: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you can talk about the data center group numbers. I guess both the 20% year-on-year decline in cloud and the 14% decline in platform average selling price. How much of that is just this kind of lingering cloud digestion and what\u2019s your visibility to that resuming and is there any competitive aspect you think to the weakness there?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. I will start on that one and ask George to jump in a little bit. Overall, as George said in his comments, Q1 was a little bit better than we expected for DCG in terms of revenue and we see it improving as we go through the year. So we saw this at the bottom. A lot of that was driven exactly as you asked in the question by cloud digestion. We had an extraordinary last year. But now customers are almost through the digestion of that and we are starting to see signs that they want to start the next build phase in their cloud. But we also saw some just great successes with the enterprise business starting to pick up, some of the networking business wins were very strong for our 5G area. So, overall, we believe we are on a path back to growth. I\u2019d also emphasize that the Ice Lake launch superb, right? This product major gains in generation-to-generation improvement and absolute areas of differentiation like the AI performance. And as we said, this is AI-infused now into the 100 million plus Xeon sockets as we are bringing AI into every one of them. This is a powerful new capability and getting great response from our customers overall. So we feel very good about the path that we are on. And our overall outlook for the year is that we are going to continue to see that momentum build as we go through the year and expect to see the business response, the competitive position, the customers getting on Board. It\u2019s an exciting time for our data center business. George, anything you would add?\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. I would say, really if you think about the impact year-over-year in the first quarter, more than half of it was just the fact that we are comparing the bottom -- what we now believe to be the bottom of the digestion phase with a very, very strong Q1. The other piece is our investment is going up in this space. This is clearly, we are -- as we made progress on 7-nanometer, you are starting to see 7-nanometer costs reflected that weren\u2019t there year-over-year. That\u2019s a good thing. That gets much better over time. Also, almost on the same scale, we have increased OpEx to drive the Xeon roadmap even harder in line with some of the things that Pat was talking about. And then finally, you also have -- this is a start-up of the 10-nanometer generation for server and so you are starting to see the initial cost impacts on that. We are already seeing very strong 10-nanometer cost improvements in the client side of the business. Some of that is obviously helping DCG today, but it\u2019s going to -- they have got some work still to go through as they start to ramp their mix from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer.\nJoe Moore: Great. And just to make sure, the 14% decline in platform ASP, was that more mix related towards comms or was there something, as well as any decline like-for-like?\nGeorge Davis: It was -- you have got a lot higher relative mix of SoCs and whatnot in there. When you are down on revenue, all those mix comparisons get tougher and you are down on the strongest margin mix area.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. You may begin.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask that question a little bit more explicitly. So if more than half, about half or whatever of the ASP decline year-over-year, the 14% in data center was due to SoC mix and product mix, what was the other half coming from? How much of that is direct ASP decline and what should we expect on that front as we go into the second half? And how does that tie into the implied gross margin guidance in the second half, which is for the company which is down something like 250 bps second half versus first half?\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. So I think let me just clarify, Stacy. So the lower revenue includes the ASP and volume effect compared to what we were seeing in the first quarter of last year. So that\u2019s what was over half of it. I would say the remaining was split between the factory start-up costs that I talked about, higher OpEx, since we are talking about operating margin, and then just the unit cost impact of ramping 10-nanometer relative to what they saw year-over-year. And when we think about the second half of the year on the overall margin, we think you are seeing -- going to see some margin impacts actually from the supply situation impacting the mix and the volume that we are going to see out of client. Again, the 7-nanometer start-up costs ramp throughout the year. So that\u2019s probably the next biggest factor and then a little bit offset by the fact that we are going to see server start to recover.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And overall, Stacy, I\u2019d just add it\u2019s about building leadership products. Ice Lake is a great product and we are seeing a strong ramp for it. As the products get better, ASPs will get better and then we are going to be very aggressive in terms of market share in this area. So we feel like we are now very much on the front foot again in this business and we are starting to see the market respond that way. And with some of the things that we have talked about with Ice Lake in particular and our Sapphire Rapids program following up, we are on a good competitive dynamic and we are leaning into this area of our business and we are seeing great response from our customers.\nStacy Rasgon: Can you define what you mean aggressive on market share?\nPat Gelsinger: Exactly that. Aggressive on market share, we are going to fight for every socket in the market. This is an area that is core to our business. We are going to be aggressive. We have just delivered a great new product for it. We are going to be using our system design, our validation, our software assets, our customer relationships, our supply chain, everything that we can to bring value to our customers. They are looking for us, building on that 100 million install base of servers that we have now. This is a great business and one that we are going to be very aggressive in bringing the best things to our customers. And I\u2019d also say, Stacy that, as you think about this business, this is an area that with our cloud partners, our IDM 2.0 strategy is powerful. Now we are saying to them not only are we going to be building better and better products for you in this area. But we are also going to be co-designing, co-innovating and bringing new capabilities for them to optimize solutions for their markets as well. Yes, we are going to be aggressive in the data center and cloud business going forward. \nOperator: And John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Data center\u2026\nOperator: Your line is open, John.\nJohn Pitzer: Can you guys hear me?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Thank you, John.\nGeorge Davis: We can hear you now, John.\nJohn Pitzer: Sorry, about that. Pat, just sticking on the theme of data center and the cloud business, can you help us understand why you are comfortable that this is digestion and not something more like cloud guys going to more internal solutions or solutions away from Intel? And I sort of ask the question because cloud was down about 15% year-over-year in Q4. It\u2019s down about 30% in Q1. I know you have another hard compare year-over-year on Q2, but what gives you confidence that this is digestion and not something more and I know in George\u2019s prepared comments, he said all of data center would be up sequentially in June. Do you expect that for the cloud portion as well?\nPat Gelsinger: So, at the highest level, I will just say, we work intimately with these customers, right? Our people are in their environments, we are working supply chains, we are building forecasts with them, we know what their inventory levels are. These are very intimate relationships. So I\u2019d just say at that level, we are confident when we speak that what they are doing and what we are going to see in the future and how they are digesting and deploying the products that we delivered to them last year are now ramping in and becoming instances they are selling and services they are selling as well. I will say because of that intimate relationship that we have. We are quite confident in those comments. Like we said, as we see the sequential growth, we expect that across the business. We see that at networking, we see that at enterprise and government and we see that at cloud as well. We do see some of the elements that we talked about with respect to some of them exploring some of their own design work, and I will just say with that, we are very close to that. Those are fairly modest overall in terms of their volume so far. And as I mentioned in the last question, this is an area that the IDM 2.0 strategy, the Intel Foundry Services is powerful and the response that we have seen from those customers saying, wow, now we can co-innovate without doing all the work of creating a new architectural point in the cloud environment, this is powerful and something that we think is uniquely going to help us to navigate them to an answer that is much more favorable for them as well as for us and we are off to a great start.\nGeorge Davis: Hey. Hey, John, one thing I would add, we are going to see growth in all three of the major areas in data center, but the standout grower in Q2 is going to be cloud.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. You may begin.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Yeah. Thank you. Pat and George, I just wanted to come back to the IDM 2.0 strategy. George, you mentioned that clamping down on buyback, which makes sense, so somewhat capital allocation, excuse me. But how should investors be thinking about the impact to P&L as you go through implementing IDM 2.0? And kind of related to that is free cash flow impact as you go through an elevated level of capital spend and what really are the milestones that investors should be looking for?\nGeorge Davis: Yeah and thanks for the question. We are clearly going to cover a lot of those details at our Analyst Day, which will be much more forward-looking. And as you know, the investment cycles are for foundry are long. Not only does it take time to qualify customers, also capacity additions take a certain period of time. What we are doing to be nimble is, investing aggressively in the build-out of shelf, which will give us -- and Arizona is a very good example of that where, first off, we have been chasing demand for certainly since I have been here and for a number of years. And the idea being we have got to have more optionality to respond to the market both for foundry and also for our core market which we cannot fulfill today.  And so, what you will see from us is really building in that optionality. So you would expect capital to be up somewhat reflecting that. That will have some impact on free cash flow. But we also -- we have a good growth forecast and which helps obviously with growth of cash from operations. And so, overall, I think, the investment cycle for this will be logical as we lay it out. The types of returns you can get will be an investment phase for sure for the next two years to three years. But then you start to see customer demand starting to balance out the investment.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And I\u2019d just add to that from some of the things building on the unleashed announcement in March, right? Yeah, this is a good market, $100 billion foundry market, a huge emphasis in that for leading-edge capacity which we are uniquely suited to give. And I\u2019d say competitors aren\u2019t able to catch up with demand in this area and factories take a long time to build. And we are clearly, as George has laid out, this is something that the optionality helps our existing business, as well as our foundry business.  Finally, the characteristics of the foundry business for somebody like us, it\u2019s a good business. Not only is it large, but it has good margin characteristics and we expect that we are going to be able to produce good returns over the long-term. And as we think about this, again, we go back. The world needs more semiconductor capacity. It wants a more balanced supply chain. We are seeing industry say that, we are seeing governments say that and we are uniquely positioned to fulfill that.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. You may begin.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the roadmap for gross margin both kind of near and longer term. On the near-term, your implied gross margin in the back half are about 55% plus minus. Is this the trough and is this kind of the starting point for calendar 2022 that we should keep in mind as we start to invest more in 7-nanometer? And then longer term, when I look at your CapEx now, it\u2019s about 25%, 27% of sales, much higher than depreciation. So what is the additional pressure as those things converge? And when I look at the foundry business that you are talking about, the best foundry in the world makes 50% gross margin. So how should we think about gross margin both near-term and the longer term? Thank you.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. First off, we are probably not going to be able to forecast 2022 and beyond on this call. We will certainly give you an idea of what margins will look like over time at Analyst Day. But for the remainder of the year, as I talked about, the first half, second half dynamics are really, we are in a supply constrained environment and client and it\u2019s constrained in a way that exposes us to more small core than we would -- than our higher ASP and higher margin products. The other piece is the 7-nanometer start-up, which I talked about, which is a good factor. This is really the showing the readiness of both the process and products to move forward on 7-nanometer. We will get some help because we will see strong recovery from server. Some of that is muted a little bit, because there -- this is really where they are ramping the 10-nanometer off of 14, which was a very mature node and so it won\u2019t be quite as rich as we would expect. But I feel good about where we can drive margins over the long run. You are not going to see material impacts this year from the IFS activities. Obviously, we will be making some investments. But those investments are for the next year or two really are critical just to meet -- most of that investment is critical just to meet the increasing demand that we see on client.\nVivek Arya: And when do depreciation and CapEx converge, George?\nGeorge Davis: We will -- it will depend really on what the multiyear capital picture looks like. So we will have to wait and discuss that when we are ready to give a multiyear picture.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. I\u2019d just say, this is a pivotal year.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah.\nPat Gelsinger: Right. I mean, this is where we are building out the IDM 2.0 strategy, we are getting our product roadmap back in shape. Leadership products produce leadership margins and as we see as we go through the year, we have opportunities for supply, right? As we drive revenues, if we are overachieving, and as George said in his prepared remarks, if we overachieve on supply, we will see revenue, we will see gross margin improvements and leadership products as we are committing to on our roadmap over time, we will get us back to leadership margins.  So, overall, this is pivotal and we are well underway, right, in making that turn to have I will say Intel is back, right, with the kind of products, right, the kind of growth that you would expect to want to see from us.\nVivek Arya: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may begin.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. George, I had a two-part question. I guess the first thing is the $500 million in prepayments that was corporate related, where was that reported from a segment perspective or was it sort of like sprinkled throughout all the segments? And I guess the second part is, just on CapEx, I know you had talked before about some CapEx had pushed from last year into this year. I think it was $1.5 billion or something like that. So I am sort of wondering what the right sort of new normal is as you trajectory into next year. Is it -- is like $20 billion the right number or is it a little bit less than $20 billion? Thanks.\nGeorge Davis: Yeah. First off, the $500 million was not spread. It was in other revenue. So all in one place. On -- in terms of the CapEx, yes, we had basically eight weeks or more of capital push out just because of the pandemic. It really affected the construction activities. And as you know, it continues to be challenging. But that was probably the biggest factor that we saw last year. So maybe $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you could argue is really just catching up with where we were behind from last year and so you could add both that to our free cash flow estimates for the year and also you could bring down the CapEx requirements for this year. So I think the $20 billion for this year is a good number and we will talk more about next year later.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks, George.\nGeorge Davis: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street. You may begin.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Pat, I\u2019d like to come back to what you said about your foundry initiative and there are really two ways I look at it. One is bringing a foundry service where your clients can integrate what they want to design with Intel\u2019s IP? And one is more like being like the mainstream general foundry to compete more directly with existing players like Samsung and TSMC? And so what -- and I think these two are very different in nature. And what I was wondering is in the conversations that you have had so far, what would you say the conversations were most in terms on the first one versus the second one? And then in your own mind, if you think about Intel in the long run, how do you see the balance between these two ways to -- of being a foundry in your business mix?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for the question, Pierre. I think it\u2019s a good question. And to some degree, I\u2019d say, we don\u2019t know, right? We are in this phase where we are beginning to engage with customers. We have a good pipeline of customers that fit in both of those buckets, right? Definitely some of the cloud customers particularly interested in where they can comingle or create I will say hybrid design some of their IP with some of our IP. And then we have a very rich pipeline of customers really across pretty much every segment of the industry, communications providers, auto makers, et cetera, that would fit into the second bucket where it\u2019s much more about them using us as a world-class foundry for all of their designs. I will say, we view this as a very, I will say, right, broad set of customers that we are aiming at with a broad set of IP. And as we get IP for the Risk 5, the ARM ecosystem and the x86 ecosystem, our value proposition to customers is across that spectrum where they don\u2019t need to decide ours versus theirs. They get to design with that full spectrum. The other thing I would say, Pierre, is, we are also seeing extreme interest in our packaging technologies. And here it might be a tile from Samsung or TSMC being combined with a tile from Intel, right? And those might be on older process technologies, newer process technologies, and taking advantage of our world-class packaging and assembly test technologies. So we really see that full spectrum coming to bear and it really is that combination of world-class foundry, world-class IP, world-class assembly package and test that we think gives us a unique proposition in the industry, and so far, the enthusiasm is very high for that offering. G And Pierre, I would add as you talked about the two different alternatives, one of the things to remember is that if you look at our internal roadmap, people are used to seeing a highly differentiated and very specific to Intel set of IP capabilities. We have said over time that, it\u2019s very clear that we are going to be adopting more and more of the industry ecosystem IPs and libraries, because it makes sense to do it. And it makes sense in terms of cycle time, in terms of taking advantage of capabilities that already exist out there. So we are closing -- we are not going to -- when we intercept on some of these nodes, we are not going to be as far away, I think, as people might think, in terms of being able to demonstrate a lot of knowledge around many of the IP blocks that our customers depend on today.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Let me just add to that. I think it\u2019s a great point, George, because, every IP that I generate from the industry increases the IP available to my internal design teams. Every piece of IP I develop internally is going to be made available to the industry, right, for their use as well. This becomes a powerful reinforcing siren cycle, right? Also we are being benchmarked against the industry for our process technology as we move to industry standard PBKs, right? We are seeing strong embrace from the EDA suppliers. So we see all of this as it makes our process better, it makes our product better, it increases our efficiency and takes our clock rate of innovation up with the industry. It\u2019s a powerful strategy.\nPierre Ferragu: Makes sense. Thanks, George and Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. You may begin.\nChris Danely: Thanks, guys. I always thought I was Jewish. I guess I am Italian now.\nPat Gelsinger: Now you can be Catholic.\nChris Danely: So it seems like we are in the middle of this never ending fuselage of ARM products out there both from a merchant and a captive perspective. So, Pat, I\u2019d just appreciate your thoughts on, I guess, where you see things shaking out on an x86 versus ARM both in the PC and the data center space. And would you guys ever consider maybe licensing the x86 technology to some of your hyperscale customers and having them design their own products with the foundry?\nPat Gelsinger: The simple answer to the last part of the question is, yes. That\u2019s what we just announced, right? X86 cores will be available on our foundry services and available for people to design with them. So that will include the cloud service providers to take advantage of that. So the simple answer is, yes. And we do believe that the ability for our customers to take advantage of x86 this way will be a meaningful shift in how people think about ARM versus x86. Because part of it was we weren\u2019t giving them the flexibility to design to comingle IP as I have described it. So they really -- they were trying to do unique design work. They didn\u2019t have a good x86 choice. We gave them our standard products which have lots of capabilities but particularly for the cloud guy and say, boy, I don\u2019t use those particular features. I really could optimize with the few of these other things in the network and the memory hierarchy and now we are saying absolutely come on in and we are opening the doors of our IP, the doors of our leading process and packaging technologies, to be able to say let\u2019s do this together or let them do their own designs in our foundry as well. It\u2019s a very powerful strategy that I think will be a meaningful shift in the exact question that you asked. Overall, we do think that making the x86 available this way is powerful. There are trillion lines of code that have been optimized for the x86. This is a powerful ecosystem that continues to have very great innovation and capabilities associated with it. And we are enhancing that with new capabilities like AI being integrated into the core instruction set of the new products as you saw with Ice Lake. These are powerful differentiators. We are continuing to innovate and the ecosystem is excited about what we are doing in our standard products, as well as what we are making available through IDM 2.0.\nChris Danely: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. You may begin.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Pat, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the data center in terms of architecture and I think on the strategy event, I asked a similar one and maybe we can dig into it a little bit more here. I know you guys just launched Ice Lake and a lot of new features and capabilities as you lay out, but it is a platform transition from Cascade Lake and then another platform transition on to Sapphire. And I just wonder, first, what\u2019s been the feedback from Ice Lake as you guys have sampled it and now launched it in terms of platform compatibility issues that customers might be facing? And I guess, the second part of the question is, what has been the feedback from customers that you have sampled Sapphire Rapids to particularly around the change from a single die to a tile architecture and what that does to the memory system? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. I think we could spend an hour on that question. So let me try to be quick here for it. The response from Ice Lake has been very strong. Early ramp is very strong, obviously, with the platform change, that does put a bit more work on the part of the customers, but we have been working through that with them, good response to that as well. And as your question suggests, I mean, clearly, it would be better if we weren\u2019t bringing a new platform transition with Sapphire Rapids as well. But there are so many good things in that platform that the customers are excited about, new PCI, new DVR, and probably, most seminally is the new CXL launch, right, as part of that. And I will tell you opening up, right, that additional interface on the platform has gotten tremendous support from the industry, new capabilities, co-processor capabilities, memory pooling capabilities, really has been maybe the most exciting new platform capability since the PCI gen when we introduced that quite a number of years ago. So a lot of excitement about that and particularly for cloud customers who have -- I have seen their memory portion of their TCO cost rise quite rapidly. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm in that area of the platform.  So I\u2019d say, overall, yeah, we would have probably liked to have less platform transitions in this. But so far the response from customers is they are going through those transitions with us, they are seeing value in those transitions. And particularly as I say as we look out to the Sapphire Rapids generation, there\u2019s a lot of value there with some of the major, major enhancements that are part of that. Obviously as we look further out in time, having more platform stability in the architecture, I think, is something that we are striving for. But I think as we lay out the 2023, 2024, 2025 roadmap direction to the industry, you will start to see that theme much more seminally, right, centered in the roadmap. Also I think as we get all aspects of our core leadership, our vector AI leadership, process leadership, all of those start to come into play. I think we will see a very nice view of how that platform architecture lays out over time.\nMatt Ramsay: Great. Thank you.\nTony Balow: Pat, do you have any closing thoughts for the call?\nPat Gelsinger: Well, hey, first, I just want to again say thank you to everybody for joining my first call back as the CEO of VMware. One opportunity -- one last opportunity to say Intel is back. We are firing on all cylinders. Our best days are ahead of us. We are investing for the future, we are executing and we are just getting started. Look forward to our next quarterly call with you.\nTony Balow: Thanks, Pat. Thank you all for joining today. Operator, could you please close the call.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you for my first earnings call. I consider it an honor to be CEO of this great company. Thanks for joining today. Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottomline driven by exceptional demand for our products and exclusive execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors. Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating and executing. It's amazing to be back at Intel and Intel is back. Before George takes you through the financial details of the quarter, I will begin with the industry trends we are seeing and why Intel is well-positioned to aggressively capitalize on them. Said simply, Intel is the only company with the depth and breadth of software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process with at-scale manufacturing that customers can depend on for their next-generation innovations. There are four super powers driving digital transformation, cloud, connectivity, artificial intelligence and the intelligent edge. Intel's mission and we are uniquely positioned to do so, is to help customers harness these super powers to improve the lives of every human on the planet. The digitization of everything was remarkably accelerated by COVID and has spurred innovation and new models of working and learning, interacting and care. Technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence and semiconductors are the foundation. This is creating a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that will result in sustained growth for a decade or more. The PC ecosystem in particular is experiencing resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamic of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012 and that's continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history. Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, one PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education, where on a global basis, the number of PCs per hundred students and teachers still remains in the single digits. Every student needs a laptop. We have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over four years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity. Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic. As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake H ahead of schedule in 10-nanometers and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14-nanometers in the second half of the year. Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience and we are deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners including Microsoft, Google and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than a million units a day. With over 100 million Xeon servers in the install base, the world runs on Intel. Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry's broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new 3rd-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor code named Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers.  Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application. As the only x86 Data Center CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads and our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, UC San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager super computer. Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye's assisted driving technology continues to win over auto makers with eight new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with a win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year. We continue to have extraordinary success winning in the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We are already seeing significant adoption of oneAPI and oneAPI power tool kits for high performance computing, AI and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing oneAPI's open standard space approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors. This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing oneAPI at scale. The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We have doubled our internal wafer capacity the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages. This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel foundry services. Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customer's surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply. Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It's a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market. It's clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services, starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe, while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world. Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services have already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We are seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers. We have been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near- and long-term. We are doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future. We are encouraged by President Biden's recognition of semiconductor manufacturing as a critical component of our national infrastructure, and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs Plan. Looking ahead, we are confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7-nanometers is progressing well and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply, resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.  By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we will tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year and ramp in the first half of 2022. Overall, our 2023 roadmaps are firm and under execution, and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well underway to provide unquestioned leadership product in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate and the drive that made us great. We are reigniting our culture to attract, retain, and motivate the best and brightest engineers in the industry. In fact, we have onboarded over 2,000 engineers so far this year including the recent key hire of Sanjay Natarajan, who will co-lead our logic technology development. In total, we expect to add several thousand more engineers by the end of the year. 2021 is a pivotal year as we lay the foundation of our winning IDM 2.0 strategy and invest in our future to accelerate our trajectory and execution. Given the incredible demand for computing, the strength of our IDM 2.0 strategy and the technology investments we are making, I am certain Intel's best days are in front of us. Yeah. Hey. Thank you for the question, Harlan. And overall as I said on the call, we are seeing very good progress on the 7-nanometer team. They are executing now. We are very confident with the changes that we made on that and the move to really embrace EUV and since we have done that we have just seen superb execution. And as I said in the unleashed event, we expect to move to a yearly cadence or better for our process technology, and we are going to be laying that path out very clearly. We are excited about our team's ability to get us back to process parity and ultimately to sustained leadership yet again. And I am very happy with the team and some of the investments we are making. The hiring of Sanjay Natarajan that we talked about, the team is getting fired up to execute on that. We also see, this is just one piece of our technology leadership strategy and as we have seen in the IDM 2.0 strategy, it's about packaging. It's about the process. It's about the full set of IP that we are bringing to the table and at-scale manufacturing and I will say some of the early enthusiasm that we have seen from some of the foundry customer pipeline is really bringing together our packaging technology with the full IDM 2.0 strategy. So, overall, getting back to the heart of your question, exactly. We are going to increase the cadence of our process technology innovations. We are seeing very positive signs since we made this change and we are on track to parity and again sustained leadership out in the future. Our team is firing on all cylinders and I am excited about what we are seeing as we monitor those milestones very rigorously going forward. This team is on fire and we are executing. Yeah. Overall, let's just paint the picture a little bit more broadly, C.J. and thanks for the question. On the IDM 2.0 strategy, we are all about making leading edge capacity available for our foundry customers. And the world needs more leading edge capacity and there's very few companies that can supply it around the world. So we are seeing a lot of enthusiasm for that. It's going to cause us to build and expand our capacity more aggressively. And as you suggest, it also means we have a better monetization on the longer life cycle of the foundry business and we are planning on getting to foundry kind of margins with that investment. Now, as we have already begun engaging with customers, we have seen enthusiasm, right? We have seen enthusiasm that they get to design on our leading process technology and they have more choices for where that might be coming from. We are also seeing enthusiasm for this idea that they can bring some of their IP and bring our IP to the table, and in particular some of the cloud customers have been very excited about that ability to say, hey, I can take some of my cool ideas and be better optimized and including things like x86 Cores to have a more optimized solution for their market requirements. This is compelling for them. And then we combine that with all the other strengths that we have talked about such as at-scale manufacturing and in a supply constrained environment like we are in right now, boy, that's bringing enthusiasm from customers. Also, we get to do that with all of the other assets that we have with packaging, our software technology. We think this is a strategy that will be very powerful for the industry and we have seen that response from early customers, the EDA tool chains, the IP suppliers. This is really hit the right time in the industry. And we are seeing the international aspects as well as the government aspect saying, yeah, we need a more geographically disbursed resilient supply chain for something that's critical to the future of humanity and semiconductor technology. This is the right strategy for the right time and we are seeing great response from it. Yeah. I will start on that one and ask George to jump in a little bit. Overall, as George said in his comments, Q1 was a little bit better than we expected for DCG in terms of revenue and we see it improving as we go through the year. So we saw this at the bottom. A lot of that was driven exactly as you asked in the question by cloud digestion. We had an extraordinary last year. But now customers are almost through the digestion of that and we are starting to see signs that they want to start the next build phase in their cloud. But we also saw some just great successes with the enterprise business starting to pick up, some of the networking business wins were very strong for our 5G area. So, overall, we believe we are on a path back to growth. I'd also emphasize that the Ice Lake launch superb, right? This product major gains in generation-to-generation improvement and absolute areas of differentiation like the AI performance. And as we said, this is AI-infused now into the 100 million plus Xeon sockets as we are bringing AI into every one of them. This is a powerful new capability and getting great response from our customers overall. So we feel very good about the path that we are on. And our overall outlook for the year is that we are going to continue to see that momentum build as we go through the year and expect to see the business response, the competitive position, the customers getting on Board. It's an exciting time for our data center business. George, anything you would add? Yeah. And overall, Stacy, I'd just add it's about building leadership products. Ice Lake is a great product and we are seeing a strong ramp for it. As the products get better, ASPs will get better and then we are going to be very aggressive in terms of market share in this area. So we feel like we are now very much on the front foot again in this business and we are starting to see the market respond that way. And with some of the things that we have talked about with Ice Lake in particular and our Sapphire Rapids program following up, we are on a good competitive dynamic and we are leaning into this area of our business and we are seeing great response from our customers. Exactly that. Aggressive on market share, we are going to fight for every socket in the market. This is an area that is core to our business. We are going to be aggressive. We have just delivered a great new product for it. We are going to be using our system design, our validation, our software assets, our customer relationships, our supply chain, everything that we can to bring value to our customers. They are looking for us, building on that 100 million install base of servers that we have now. This is a great business and one that we are going to be very aggressive in bringing the best things to our customers. And I'd also say, Stacy that, as you think about this business, this is an area that with our cloud partners, our IDM 2.0 strategy is powerful. Now we are saying to them not only are we going to be building better and better products for you in this area. But we are also going to be co-designing, co-innovating and bringing new capabilities for them to optimize solutions for their markets as well. Yes, we are going to be aggressive in the data center and cloud business going forward. Yeah. Thank you, John. So, at the highest level, I will just say, we work intimately with these customers, right? Our people are in their environments, we are working supply chains, we are building forecasts with them, we know what their inventory levels are. These are very intimate relationships. So I'd just say at that level, we are confident when we speak that what they are doing and what we are going to see in the future and how they are digesting and deploying the products that we delivered to them last year are now ramping in and becoming instances they are selling and services they are selling as well. I will say because of that intimate relationship that we have. We are quite confident in those comments. Like we said, as we see the sequential growth, we expect that across the business. We see that at networking, we see that at enterprise and government and we see that at cloud as well. We do see some of the elements that we talked about with respect to some of them exploring some of their own design work, and I will just say with that, we are very close to that. Those are fairly modest overall in terms of their volume so far. And as I mentioned in the last question, this is an area that the IDM 2.0 strategy, the Intel Foundry Services is powerful and the response that we have seen from those customers saying, wow, now we can co-innovate without doing all the work of creating a new architectural point in the cloud environment, this is powerful and something that we think is uniquely going to help us to navigate them to an answer that is much more favorable for them as well as for us and we are off to a great start. Yeah. And I'd just add to that from some of the things building on the unleashed announcement in March, right? Yeah, this is a good market, $100 billion foundry market, a huge emphasis in that for leading-edge capacity which we are uniquely suited to give. And I'd say competitors aren't able to catch up with demand in this area and factories take a long time to build. And we are clearly, as George has laid out, this is something that the optionality helps our existing business, as well as our foundry business.  Finally, the characteristics of the foundry business for somebody like us, it's a good business. Not only is it large, but it has good margin characteristics and we expect that we are going to be able to produce good returns over the long-term. And as we think about this, again, we go back. The world needs more semiconductor capacity. It wants a more balanced supply chain. We are seeing industry say that, we are seeing governments say that and we are uniquely positioned to fulfill that. Yeah. I'd just say, this is a pivotal year. Right. I mean, this is where we are building out the IDM 2.0 strategy, we are getting our product roadmap back in shape. Leadership products produce leadership margins and as we see as we go through the year, we have opportunities for supply, right? As we drive revenues, if we are overachieving, and as George said in his prepared remarks, if we overachieve on supply, we will see revenue, we will see gross margin improvements and leadership products as we are committing to on our roadmap over time, we will get us back to leadership margins.  So, overall, this is pivotal and we are well underway, right, in making that turn to have I will say Intel is back, right, with the kind of products, right, the kind of growth that you would expect to want to see from us. Yeah. Hey. Thanks for the question, Pierre. I think it's a good question. And to some degree, I'd say, we don't know, right? We are in this phase where we are beginning to engage with customers. We have a good pipeline of customers that fit in both of those buckets, right? Definitely some of the cloud customers particularly interested in where they can comingle or create I will say hybrid design some of their IP with some of our IP. And then we have a very rich pipeline of customers really across pretty much every segment of the industry, communications providers, auto makers, et cetera, that would fit into the second bucket where it's much more about them using us as a world-class foundry for all of their designs. I will say, we view this as a very, I will say, right, broad set of customers that we are aiming at with a broad set of IP. And as we get IP for the Risk 5, the ARM ecosystem and the x86 ecosystem, our value proposition to customers is across that spectrum where they don't need to decide ours versus theirs. They get to design with that full spectrum. The other thing I would say, Pierre, is, we are also seeing extreme interest in our packaging technologies. And here it might be a tile from Samsung or TSMC being combined with a tile from Intel, right? And those might be on older process technologies, newer process technologies, and taking advantage of our world-class packaging and assembly test technologies. So we really see that full spectrum coming to bear and it really is that combination of world-class foundry, world-class IP, world-class assembly package and test that we think gives us a unique proposition in the industry, and so far, the enthusiasm is very high for that offering. G And Pierre, I would add as you talked about the two different alternatives, one of the things to remember is that if you look at our internal roadmap, people are used to seeing a highly differentiated and very specific to Intel set of IP capabilities. We have said over time that, it's very clear that we are going to be adopting more and more of the industry ecosystem IPs and libraries, because it makes sense to do it. And it makes sense in terms of cycle time, in terms of taking advantage of capabilities that already exist out there. So we are closing -- we are not going to -- when we intercept on some of these nodes, we are not going to be as far away, I think, as people might think, in terms of being able to demonstrate a lot of knowledge around many of the IP blocks that our customers depend on today. Yeah. Let me just add to that. I think it's a great point, George, because, every IP that I generate from the industry increases the IP available to my internal design teams. Every piece of IP I develop internally is going to be made available to the industry, right, for their use as well. This becomes a powerful reinforcing siren cycle, right? Also we are being benchmarked against the industry for our process technology as we move to industry standard PBKs, right? We are seeing strong embrace from the EDA suppliers. So we see all of this as it makes our process better, it makes our product better, it increases our efficiency and takes our clock rate of innovation up with the industry. It's a powerful strategy. Thanks. Now you can be Catholic. The simple answer to the last part of the question is, yes. That's what we just announced, right? X86 cores will be available on our foundry services and available for people to design with them. So that will include the cloud service providers to take advantage of that. So the simple answer is, yes. And we do believe that the ability for our customers to take advantage of x86 this way will be a meaningful shift in how people think about ARM versus x86. Because part of it was we weren't giving them the flexibility to design to comingle IP as I have described it. So they really -- they were trying to do unique design work. They didn't have a good x86 choice. We gave them our standard products which have lots of capabilities but particularly for the cloud guy and say, boy, I don't use those particular features. I really could optimize with the few of these other things in the network and the memory hierarchy and now we are saying absolutely come on in and we are opening the doors of our IP, the doors of our leading process and packaging technologies, to be able to say let's do this together or let them do their own designs in our foundry as well. It's a very powerful strategy that I think will be a meaningful shift in the exact question that you asked. Overall, we do think that making the x86 available this way is powerful. There are trillion lines of code that have been optimized for the x86. This is a powerful ecosystem that continues to have very great innovation and capabilities associated with it. And we are enhancing that with new capabilities like AI being integrated into the core instruction set of the new products as you saw with Ice Lake. These are powerful differentiators. We are continuing to innovate and the ecosystem is excited about what we are doing in our standard products, as well as what we are making available through IDM 2.0. Yeah. I think we could spend an hour on that question. So let me try to be quick here for it. The response from Ice Lake has been very strong. Early ramp is very strong, obviously, with the platform change, that does put a bit more work on the part of the customers, but we have been working through that with them, good response to that as well. And as your question suggests, I mean, clearly, it would be better if we weren't bringing a new platform transition with Sapphire Rapids as well. But there are so many good things in that platform that the customers are excited about, new PCI, new DVR, and probably, most seminally is the new CXL launch, right, as part of that. And I will tell you opening up, right, that additional interface on the platform has gotten tremendous support from the industry, new capabilities, co-processor capabilities, memory pooling capabilities, really has been maybe the most exciting new platform capability since the PCI gen when we introduced that quite a number of years ago. So a lot of excitement about that and particularly for cloud customers who have -- I have seen their memory portion of their TCO cost rise quite rapidly. There's a lot of enthusiasm in that area of the platform.  So I'd say, overall, yeah, we would have probably liked to have less platform transitions in this. But so far the response from customers is they are going through those transitions with us, they are seeing value in those transitions. And particularly as I say as we look out to the Sapphire Rapids generation, there's a lot of value there with some of the major, major enhancements that are part of that. Obviously as we look further out in time, having more platform stability in the architecture, I think, is something that we are striving for. But I think as we lay out the 2023, 2024, 2025 roadmap direction to the industry, you will start to see that theme much more seminally, right, centered in the roadmap. Also I think as we get all aspects of our core leadership, our vector AI leadership, process leadership, all of those start to come into play. I think we will see a very nice view of how that platform architecture lays out over time. Well, hey, first, I just want to again say thank you to everybody for joining my first call back as the CEO of VMware. One opportunity -- one last opportunity to say Intel is back. We are firing on all cylinders. Our best days are ahead of us. We are investing for the future, we are executing and we are just getting started. Look forward to our next quarterly call with you."

            "name": "George Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a stronger than expected start to the year, with both our PC notebook and Mobileye businesses achieving record quarters. Our revenue was $18.6 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.1 billion led by strength in our PC business and the first signs of recovery in the enterprise and government portion of our data center business. Our IoTG, Mobileye and PSG businesses also posted strong sequential growth as they began to emerge from an adverse macroeconomic environment driven by COVID. As noted in our January guidance, Q1 revenue includes an approximately $580 million one-time corporate revenue item.  Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by approximately 40 basis points largely due to flow-through on higher revenue. Q1 EPS was $1.39, up $0.29 versus guide, with the majority of the beat on strong operational performance and the balance on gains related to our ICAP portfolio. Note that these non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a charge related to VLSI litigation that are included in GAAP results. In Q1, we generated $5.5 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. We repurchased $2.4 billion of shares, completing the $20 billion repurchase plan announced in October of 2019. Going forward, we expect to have lower stock repurchases as we enter an investment phase to support strong demand growth in client, build initial infrastructure for future foundry volumes and make necessary investments to accelerate our return to process leadership. We remain committed to growing the dividend. Moving to segment performance in the quarter, CCG revenue was up 8% year-over-year, driven by all-time record notebook unit volumes, up 54% year-over-year. Increased volume in the consumer entry and education segments resulted in platform ASPs being down 20% year-over-year. Excluding this upside volume, ASP's were flat year-over-year. Combined with growth in our Wi-Fi and Thunderbolt connectivity businesses, revenue grew overall in CCG despite the ramp-down of our modem and Mac sales, and the impact of exiting our connected home division.  Operating income was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year on higher 10-nanometer mix and increased R&D investment. DCG delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, somewhat above our expectations, but down 20% year-over-year on a challenging compare. Enterprise and government saw initial recovery with sequential performance above seasonal expectations, while cloud inventory digestion persisted through the quarter as expected. Strong network SoC growth and products mix drove more than half of the 14% year-over-year ASP decline. DCG operating income in Q1 was down $2.2 billion year-over-year on lower revenue, transition to 10-nanometer and increased R&D investment in our Xeon roadmap. Our Intelligent Edge businesses were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as COVID-related demand impacts began to subside. Specifically, IoTG revenue was up 18% quarter-over-quarter with strength in retail and industrial segments. Mobileye revenue and operating margin were both all-time records at $377 million and $147 million, respectively. Mobileye continues to execute well and gain market segment share as the auto industry recovers from pandemic lows. DSG revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter with strength in its communications and embedded segments. Moving to our Q2 and full year outlook. For Q2, we are guiding revenue of $17.8 billion, down 2% year-over-year excluding our NAND business. We continue to see very strong demand for PCs, with fulfillment challenges on industry-wide component and substrate shortages. In data center, we believe revenue bottomed in Q1 and will increase in Q2 as cloud digestion impacts begin to subside, and enterprise and government momentum continues.  Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, up approximately 1 point year-over-year, driven by lower inventory reserves and improved 10-nanometer costs, partially offset by factory start-up costs. We are forecasting EPS of $1.05 per share and a tax rate of 13%. For full year, we are increasing our guidance provided in March, now forecasting $72.5 billion in revenue, up $500 million from our prior guidance, gross margin of 56.5% and EPS at $4.60, up $0.05 from our March 23 call. We now expect free cash flow to be $10.5 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations. We continue to see very strong PC demand with both TAM and our internal PC supply growing double-digits year-over-year, but we expect CCG revenue to be more first-half-weighted than normal seasonality due to industry-wide supply constraints and the continuing ramp-down of modem and Apple Mac revenue. In data center, we expect increased demand in the second half as both cloud, enterprise and government segments return to growth. Gross margin percent will be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to increased 7-nanometer start-up costs and industry-wide supply constraints impacting client volume and mix. We expect increased R&D throughout the year as we invest in our roadmap and IDM 2.0 strategy. As stated in March, this guide is tempered by DCG-related entity list uncertainty and industry-wide supply constraints, primarily impacting our client, IoTG and PSG businesses. We are working closely with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique IDM capabilities to mitigate these supply constraints, gaining market segment share and outperform this guide. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions. Yeah. I would say, really if you think about the impact year-over-year in the first quarter, more than half of it was just the fact that we are comparing the bottom -- what we now believe to be the bottom of the digestion phase with a very, very strong Q1. The other piece is our investment is going up in this space. This is clearly, we are -- as we made progress on 7-nanometer, you are starting to see 7-nanometer costs reflected that weren't there year-over-year. That's a good thing. That gets much better over time. Also, almost on the same scale, we have increased OpEx to drive the Xeon roadmap even harder in line with some of the things that Pat was talking about. And then finally, you also have -- this is a start-up of the 10-nanometer generation for server and so you are starting to see the initial cost impacts on that. We are already seeing very strong 10-nanometer cost improvements in the client side of the business. Some of that is obviously helping DCG today, but it's going to -- they have got some work still to go through as they start to ramp their mix from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer. It was -- you have got a lot higher relative mix of SoCs and whatnot in there. When you are down on revenue, all those mix comparisons get tougher and you are down on the strongest margin mix area. Yeah. So I think let me just clarify, Stacy. So the lower revenue includes the ASP and volume effect compared to what we were seeing in the first quarter of last year. So that's what was over half of it. I would say the remaining was split between the factory start-up costs that I talked about, higher OpEx, since we are talking about operating margin, and then just the unit cost impact of ramping 10-nanometer relative to what they saw year-over-year. And when we think about the second half of the year on the overall margin, we think you are seeing -- going to see some margin impacts actually from the supply situation impacting the mix and the volume that we are going to see out of client. Again, the 7-nanometer start-up costs ramp throughout the year. So that's probably the next biggest factor and then a little bit offset by the fact that we are going to see server start to recover. We can hear you now, John. Hey. Hey, John, one thing I would add, we are going to see growth in all three of the major areas in data center, but the standout grower in Q2 is going to be cloud. Yeah and thanks for the question. We are clearly going to cover a lot of those details at our Analyst Day, which will be much more forward-looking. And as you know, the investment cycles are for foundry are long. Not only does it take time to qualify customers, also capacity additions take a certain period of time. What we are doing to be nimble is, investing aggressively in the build-out of shelf, which will give us -- and Arizona is a very good example of that where, first off, we have been chasing demand for certainly since I have been here and for a number of years. And the idea being we have got to have more optionality to respond to the market both for foundry and also for our core market which we cannot fulfill today.  And so, what you will see from us is really building in that optionality. So you would expect capital to be up somewhat reflecting that. That will have some impact on free cash flow. But we also -- we have a good growth forecast and which helps obviously with growth of cash from operations. And so, overall, I think, the investment cycle for this will be logical as we lay it out. The types of returns you can get will be an investment phase for sure for the next two years to three years. But then you start to see customer demand starting to balance out the investment. Yeah. First off, we are probably not going to be able to forecast 2022 and beyond on this call. We will certainly give you an idea of what margins will look like over time at Analyst Day. But for the remainder of the year, as I talked about, the first half, second half dynamics are really, we are in a supply constrained environment and client and it's constrained in a way that exposes us to more small core than we would -- than our higher ASP and higher margin products. The other piece is the 7-nanometer start-up, which I talked about, which is a good factor. This is really the showing the readiness of both the process and products to move forward on 7-nanometer. We will get some help because we will see strong recovery from server. Some of that is muted a little bit, because there -- this is really where they are ramping the 10-nanometer off of 14, which was a very mature node and so it won't be quite as rich as we would expect. But I feel good about where we can drive margins over the long run. You are not going to see material impacts this year from the IFS activities. Obviously, we will be making some investments. But those investments are for the next year or two really are critical just to meet -- most of that investment is critical just to meet the increasing demand that we see on client. We will -- it will depend really on what the multiyear capital picture looks like. So we will have to wait and discuss that when we are ready to give a multiyear picture. Yeah. Yeah. First off, the $500 million was not spread. It was in other revenue. So all in one place. On -- in terms of the CapEx, yes, we had basically eight weeks or more of capital push out just because of the pandemic. It really affected the construction activities. And as you know, it continues to be challenging. But that was probably the biggest factor that we saw last year. So maybe $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you could argue is really just catching up with where we were behind from last year and so you could add both that to our free cash flow estimates for the year and also you could bring down the CapEx requirements for this year. So I think the $20 billion for this year is a good number and we will talk more about next year later. Thanks."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We've also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term. We made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year 2022, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expect of ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory. Accordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3, even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value. Today, I'd like to address three areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the New Year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders. First, on the macro. We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments. Having said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023. To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China. In the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year 2022. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year 2023 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome. Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory. For all of calendar year 2022, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult. Importantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened. And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment. We intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of 2022, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in 2023. We remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives. In the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year 2022, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year-on-year in calendar year 2022 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World. Our share in calendar year 2022 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate with first half 2023 server consumption TAM down year-on-year before returning to growth in the second half. While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions are further along than hyperscale. Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year 2022 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year 2022 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye. We see calendar year 2023 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today. This is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year 2023 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call. We are making tough decisions to rightsize the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments. NEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited seven businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings. We are also well underway to integrating AXG into CCG and DCAI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs. While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year 2022 did see considerable progress towards our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products, anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture. In calendar year 2022, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside. This includes the Board of Directors, with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as Chair. In addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced TikTok 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine. Rebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design. Our progress against our TV road map continue to improve throughout calendar year 2022 and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of 5 nodes in four years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Meteor Lake ramp in second half of the year. Intel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Progress in [TD] (ph) continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3 including prior customers such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS. We also have an active pipeline engagements with seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips. Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel 18A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks. In addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers. On the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of you as Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone. It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered event, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others. We are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AXG moves into DCAI, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments. Our DCAI road map only improves from here. Emerald Rapids is sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023. Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations. Further, our first efficient core product, Sierra Forest is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year-on-year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in DCAI at our next investor webinar later in Q1. Stay tuned for the invitation. In CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z790 chipset. In partnership with ASUS, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry. We also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of 2023. Meteor Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Meteor Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultra-thin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the Evo brand. The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users. Lastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year. Turning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year 2022, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server. NEX hit the key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake N and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year 2022. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in 2023. Mobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year-on-year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year 2023. Calendar year 2022 design wins, including supervision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units. In addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year 2022. Starting the year, navigating the worst supply-constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term under-loading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IBM 2.0 creating an internal foundry, evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally. As a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers, and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. We'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year 2024. Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value. We expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call. I want to remind everyone that, we are on a multi-year journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds, while executing to our long-term strategy. While I remain sober that, we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making. I can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate. Rest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so. We will, one, deliver on five nodes in four years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A. Two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp, introduce Emerald Rapids in second half 2023 and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024. Three, ramp Meteor Lake in second half 2023 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024, and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year. We also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will, one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year 2023, 2024 and 2025 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. Two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024. And three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including SCIPs and Chips in the US and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities. Before I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying, we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions. For our employees is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company. For our external owners is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equaled by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IBM 2.0.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year. As outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near-term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term. We're executing well towards our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range. Q4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges, offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion. Net CapEx was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY 2022 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023. When we spoke at Investor Day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY 2022. As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of 2022, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control. Through reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile. Moving to fourth quarter business unit results. CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year-over-year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of 2023. CCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year-over-year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our Evo and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year-over-year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix. DCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially, with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year-over-year, driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million. While still under satisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year-over-year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs. Within DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year-over-year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year-over-year, through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog. NEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year, as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mounts Evans infrastructure processing unit. Despite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs. AXG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors. Mobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year-over-year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye, growing 35% year-over-year. Fourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year-over-year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year-over-year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue. We continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of 2023 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. Before turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years. This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy. The growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC. The change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 2023. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted towards the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners. Now turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, DCAI and the x lines of business. We see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year. While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter. We're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 30% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to OpEx. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points. We continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets. While we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At Investor Day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0 from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity. For FY 2023, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth CapEx including our innovative SCIP partnership with Brookfield. We expect FY 2023 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change. Adjusted free cash flow will be below our Investor Day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of 2023 and return back towards guardrails in second half 2023. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at Investor Day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each caller to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for let me ask a question. I guess, Dave, to hit on some of the revenue questions or items you just said, do you expect the first quarter to be the bottom in absolute dollars through the year? And any color between the segments? It seems like it's exceedingly a CCG problem right now in the quarter, or is it broader than that?\nDavid Zinsner: Yeah. So you want to go first?\nPat Gelsinger: No.\nDavid Zinsner: So let me -- I'll start, and Pat\u2019s going to add some color. So on the $11 billion, we're expecting most of the business units to be down sequentially, double digits. We're not going to provide guidance for the rest of the year. But I did say that the first half is likely to be seeing these inventory corrections. The other thing I would just add is maybe color to position the year is that we're expecting Q1 to be the most significant inventory decline at our customers that we've seen in recent history. So it's -- if you look back over the last four or five quarters of reduction, this will be meaningfully higher than all of those quarters. So, obviously, that is impacting the Q1 outlook.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And clearly, as we look at Q1, affected by macro significant inventory adjustments, and that's affecting clearly clients but also data center as well. And we do see that year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter data center to be down as well. And we think that's a macro statement across all segments across cloud, enterprise, government and uniquely China. Part of our more positive expectation for the second half of the year is clearly from our customers and what we've heard from them but also with expected some level of recovery from China as well. So overall, clearly, a major inventory correction cycle and coming after back-to-school and how do they refresh our customers clearly wanting to take more aggressive steps as they adjust. But that inventory adjustment is well below their sell-out rates. So for that, we do believe that we will see recovery as they have made those inventory adjustments, and we'll see the business be stronger as we go through the year.\nDavid Zinsner: Ross, do you have a follow-up?\nRoss Seymore: I do. Quickly, Dave, I want to pivot to the gross margin side of things, excluding the change in the depreciable life side of the equation, I know revenue is the biggest headwind right now. But you had talked at the Investor Day last year about a 51% to 53% gross margin range and you want to operate within those bands. What does it take to get back to that? Is there a revenue level? Do you have to be above $17 billion, $18 billion? Are there offsets, any framework you can give to give investors confidence that we never thought we'd see a three handle on your gross margin. And so we really want to know what it's going to take to get back to a five handle. And if that's significantly changed from the last framework that you provided us?\nDavid Zinsner: Yeah, good question. So, obviously, revenue is the most significant impact to gross margins. We obviously did not expect to be down at these levels. That said, it's a function of some significant inventory burn. So it's not necessarily a reflection of the demand in the market. So, obviously, we would expect that to ever at some point, which will be a significant lift to the gross margins. The other thing is, in the first quarter, we're going to have about a 400 basis point impact on our gross margins just from under loading, because of the demand softness. And we would expect loadings to improve once we get past the inventory correction we're currently experiencing. In addition to that, we have a number of initiatives underway to improve gross margins, and we're well underway. When you look at the $3 billion reduction that we talked about for 2023, $1 billion of that is in cost of sales, and we're well underway on our way to getting that $1 billion. And then when you start click it further into the $8 billion to $10 billion that we want to hit by the end of 2025, about 66% of that, two-third of that is cost of sales improvement. And we're getting a lot of that from our internal foundry model that Pat mentioned. We're already seeing significant opportunities to be efficient \u2013 more efficient between our business units and our factories. And I think we'll have a lot of things to say over the course of this year about areas that we see meaningful improvement. Also, we have smart capital that was modest in 2022, it's going to be more significant in 2023 and much of that smart capital does translate to a better cost structure for us that will help gross margin. So net of that, I feel very confident we will get back to 51% to 53% in the medium term. And in the long term, I feel very confident we will get back to 54% to 58%. And I think Pat said it in the past, we aim to beat that range.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, how many weeks of PC microprocessor inventory is still in the channel? I'm trying to understand, whether the demand assumptions are not what they should be, right, or is it the supply assumptions? So when you say that, the consumption this year will be $270 million, right, which is the low end. How do we know that for sure? What if the consumption rate is much lower than that? So just how many weeks of PC microprocessor inventory is there? And do you think Q1 is that clearing quarter, or you think even in Q2, you could be shipping below consumption levels?\nPat Gelsinger: So overall, as we said, we saw the range $270 million, $295 million. We believe the sell-through rate will be to the lower end of that. The consumption that we saw in Q4 was well below that, and the consumption rate or the sell-in rate in Q1 is even more significantly almost 2x more significant below the consumption rate. Obviously, these are the macro effects that we can't predict, and that's what's taken us a bit more to the low end of the range. But clearly, as we've been working with our customers and channel partners, we've been monitoring very carefully the sellout that they've seen. So we're pretty comfortable with that range. Also, we would point to China and a very unique circumstance there as is well known. And we do expect that, there'll be some level of economic recovery there, particularly we forecasted in the second half of the year. And this is a topic that we continue to work closely with our customers. That said, overall, and as we updated on our PC webinar, we do expect that the long-term market is in the 300 million unit range. So as we overcome this inventory adjustment cycle, and some of this near-term economic. And I think as you heard from Microsoft, PC usage is up, , the number of hours per PC continues to be up. The installed base has gone up. So all of those factors give us reasonable confidence that post this period of inventory correction that will have a very healthy $300 million unit plus or minus market that we're selling into.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up question?\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. And thank you, Pat. Second question is on the data center. Historically, the semiconductor market likes incumbency, and there is only a share shift if and when the incumbent messes up. And right now, your competitor seems to be becoming a larger incumbent in a lot of cloud deployments, doesn't seem to be messing up. Doesn't it make it harder to displace them? I'm just curious that what edge do you think Intel has to change the status quo of share shift in cloud server? Do you think your design will get noticeably better? Is it architecture? Is it manufacturing? What helps you specifically to change this current momentum of share shift in cloud servers, specifically? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And I think the most important thing is what we just did with Sapphire Rapids, right? Our customers were anxious for a great product from Intel. Obviously, we would have liked it to be earlier, as we had initially estimated, but we are now shipping a very high-quality product with significant areas of leadership in areas like AI performance, power performance, security feature function, high-performance computing workflows that are 5x the competition and features in areas like confidential computing and security that are quite differentiated from anything in the marketplace. Obviously, share shift, right, particularly in the data center space, these designs were one a year ago, right, or two years ago. And so it takes some amount of time. And against that, we're seeing a very strong outlook for Sapphire Rapids ramp through the year, as I said, 1 million units in the middle of the year, so very strong demand from our customers. And the other thing, as we've indicated, is have we rewon our customers' confidence that they could bet on our road map. And Emerald Rapids, looking very healthy for later this year. Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest looking very healthy for next year. And all of those, I believe, are rebuilding our customers' confidence. And I believe with that, given the massive incumbency that Intel has, and I would just emphasize that even though we have seen the share shift in recent sell-in, the installed base is Intel, right? There's an enormous on some -- many of the cloud customers, 95-plus percent of their installed base is Intel that gives us a very strong incumbency that we get to renew as we rebuild our customers' confidence. So as you put all of those things together, yes, we realize that we stumble, right? We lost share. We lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year, and we're going to be building a road map that allows us to regain leadership for the long term in this critical market.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Dave, I had a question on CapEx. I know you don't want to guide for the full year, but you did say that 20% to 30% of the gross CapEx, whatever the number is this year, is going to be sets. I know you don't have a lot of visibility on the chips money you're going to get. But it seems like, best case, revenue is going to be in the mid-50s roughly. And if I take a little less than 35% of that, because you said that it's still going to be 35% or less, that will be the net CapEx intensity. And I sort of divide the numbers, it implies a gross CapEx number, something in the range of $20 billion, give or take. Can you sort of help us just handicap that number?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So let me see if I can -- obviously, we're trying to avoid guiding beyond the first quarter given the murkiness. I would just say we are very focused on the appropriate level of investment necessary for the long-term strategy of IDM 2.0, while being very thoughtful around how much CapEx we spend to manage our free cash flow. I think Smart Capital offsets will be pretty healthy this year, much better than last year. Partly, that's because we'll be fully along with SCIPs 1 with our partnership with Brookfield. We are expecting grant incentives to be a part of this year's Smart Capital offsets. And so those -- and then lastly, we do have already in place, the investment tax credit, which could have some benefit to us this year. So certainly, Smart Capital will be healthy, but we are being very prudent around our gross capital spend through the year. And we'll -- as we kind of progress through the year, we'll see how things develop, and we'll -- you can expect us to manage it accordingly. I think most importantly, we -- we did not expect to be at this revenue level, obviously, for 2023 when we talked about this, net CapEx intensity of 35%. And yet we still maintain the discipline to stay at or below that 35% for the year. And I think that's what investors should take away from that message.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Also, I'd just add, we do and Dave sort of implied it, but we do expect to do SCIP 2 this year as well, which is another source and also the credit center clearly there's motivation on the part of commerce to get that underway and the rules making in place in the near future and start to dispense funds this year. Also, I'd point to Europe as well. So it's EU chips as well as US chip. So all of those efforts are part of Smart Capital for us. We do believe that we'll have the capital necessary to meet both our near-term but more importantly, the strategic long-term investments. And that's what we say we're on track with IDM 2.0. We're on track with the capital, the builds that allow us to restore leadership in our process technology as well as have the factory capacity to both deliver that for our products as well as for our foundry customers.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have follow-up?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do, John. Dave, can you just sort of walk through maybe some of the gross margin puts and takes. I know that, again, you don't want to guide for the full year. But -- can you just help us think about what some of the puts and takes might be? I mean, obviously, as volumes grow, that will help gross margin. But are there any other puts and takes that you would sort of call out for us? Thanks.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I think clearly, revenue is going to be the most significant driver of gross margins. We're a high fixed cost model. So we suffer the consequence of that, obviously, when revenue is declining, but we also get the benefit when revenue is expanding. And so what will -- what is currently a headwind does turn to a tailwind as the business recovers. The second most significant impact we have is the underload charges. So that's 400 basis points or so this quarter. And we'll make a determination as to what loading makes sense for the second quarter as we get closer to the second quarter. But we're doing this to be appropriate in terms of our management of cash flow. But again, as business conditions adjust, we will start loading the fab at a higher rate, and that will improve gross margins. I think beyond that, it really is around a lot of the cost initiatives we have underway. It's the $3 billion for 2023, and it's the $8 billion to $10 billion improvement over the course of the next few years that really will help drive the costs and drive the gross margins beyond just revenue and loadings.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you for taking the question. Another question on CapEx. I guess bigger picture, can you speak to your CapEx philosophy in a slower demand environment? Is it finding the right number to fit a free cash flow model, or are you looking at your overall demand picture and saying, we need X minus Y wafer starts, and that's why we can spend less. Would love to get a sense of how the slowdown here is potentially changing or potentially not your strategy of spending? And if it's not, is it just simply delaying investments into 2024 and 2025? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Thanks, C.J. I'll start and ask Dave to jump in. We think about the capital budget with two lenses in mind, right? One is the strategic lens. Am I going to get back to leadership at 20A and 18A? Yes, am I going to make the capital investments required to do that? Absolutely. To some degree, do we scrub those? Could we look hard at those? Where can we save tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on those? Yes, we will. But we're not going to diminish from the capital required for strategic leadership for the long-term. So strategic capital, largely unchanged. The second bucket, of course, I'll just call it, capacity capital, right, and adjusting to the near-term ebb and flows of the business requirement. And, obviously, in this macro environment, that's been adjusted meaningfully downward and we're finding everywhere we can to squeeze our existing capacity more effectively to be more aggressive in terms of how we work with our equipment suppliers in those areas and doing everything we can to minimize the capital that's required for capacity driven requirements as well. And that's where the larger trade-offs have been. And, of course, in a business as large as ours, we have labs and buildings and everything else. We are scrubbing those like crazy as you would want us to. Dave, what else would you add?\nDavid Zinsner: You took one of mine. Obviously, the OpEx area, yeah, is an area that we've really focused on and Pat mentioned the lab piece, which is an area -- one of the areas that we have found efficiency. And I guess the last thing is that we have seen our capital offsets be higher than our original expectation. We were planning for probably one-third of what we think we'll get in 2023 when we announced our smart capital initiative in -- at the Analyst Day. So that's obviously coming in stronger. Of course, Pat already alluded to the fact that a lot of that is -- Skip has turned out to be a pretty powerful tool, and this will enable us to do a Skip 2 this year as well, which obviously helps.\nJohn Pitzer: C.J., do you have a follow-up?\nC.J. Muse: I do a quick one. And again, I know you don't want to guide the full year, but as you look at different scenario analysis for 2023, how do you see return to positive free cash flow playing out? Is that something that could come in the second half, or that's really a 2024 event?\nDavid Zinsner: Well, 2023, we were thinking was a breakeven free cash flow year for us back at the Analyst Day last February. Obviously, in the first half of this year, we're going to be below that model. But as we look into the back half of the year, we would expect to approach the model in 2023. And of course, 2024 is a bit away from where we are right now, but this is the thing that we spend a lot of time on. I would tell you one thing, if you look at our free cash flow for 2022, we came in roughly around minus $4 billion. If you remember in the quarter before, we forecasted that we would be somewhere between minus $2 billion and minus $4 billion. We were actually assuming a higher level of capital offsets, which is still coming, but pushed into 2023. And yet we still hit the high end of that range. And the way we did it was through working capital initiatives. So this is a big part of our strategy around managing free cash flow, is more attention to working capital. It's something that I think in the past may not have been a big focus here, but is a very big focus here. It's how we -- how our shipments are managed in terms of linearity, how we manage payments, how we manage our inventory. The fact that we're taking underload does affect the gross margins, but it also improves our cash flow, because we're spending less on variable costs. So these are areas that we think can be pretty beneficial to us and be a tailwind for us in terms of free cash flow as we progress through the year.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.\nMatt Ramsay: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Dave, the first question, I get it a lot is, just with the challenges that you just mentioned at C.J.'s question on free cash flow. And I guess, well done to you and your team of extracting as much cash as you did out of working capital in the quarter. But I get questions about the security of the dividend all the time. And maybe that's a Board-level decision, but maybe you and Pat could address it a bit. Is that the current levels of dividend? Is that sort of a sacrosanct thing at Intel in your current operating plan? Are there discussions around it either way? Don\u2019t shoot the messenger, it\u2019s a question I get a ton. Thanks.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Well, obviously, we announced a $0.365 dividend for the first quarter. That was consistent with the last quarter's dividend. I'd just say the Board, management, we take a very disciplined approach to the capital allocation strategy, and we're going to remain committed to being very prudent around how we allocate capital for the owners. And we are committed to maintaining a competitive dividend.\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a follow-up question?\nMatt Ramsay: Yes. Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. I guess, as my follow-up question, guys, I wanted to dig into the DCAI business a little bit. And that you guys talked about, I think, the PSG or Altera being up, I don't know, 40-odd percent year-over-year, which, if you just kind of rough math, it means that the core cloud plus enterprise server business is down 40%, something like that. And so, maybe, Pat, could you walk us through what -- is that roughly right in terms of math and just where your -- how you see share loss versus ASP versus weakness in the markets in China and enterprise? Just how do you break that down for us, what operationally is happening in the server share space? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. So PSG did have a very good quarter, has a very strong backlog, continues to grow. But I'd say the math that you suggest is quite incorrect, given the relative size of those businesses. So we'll happily offline talk a little bit more through that. That said, we did -- we grew less than the market last year and saw some share loss. We see that stabilizing this year. The key factor is better products, right? And we've just released that with Sapphire Rapids and getting great response and our announcement event on January 10 was a customer-centric ramp this baby product line. We had strong participation from all the CSPs, all of the OEMs, all of the ISVs, end users. So it was seen as a very strong event. This year, we'll be very much about ramping that and we'll see the improvements in both market share position as well as ASPs as we ramp that product through the year, and the confidence in the road map. And that will be the determinant, okay, you have a better product now, great. Customers are building it on an installed base. But do we have confidence in your long-term? So I'd say we've reestablished a very credible road map. You'll see lots of news coming from us this year as we start delivering on samples, et cetera, of the next-generation products as well as the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids with highly differentiated features and capabilities. So we feel like we've put the worst behind us, right? And we're now coming back to the front foot in this business area. And I'll say in a very customer-centric, ISV-centric way that delivers our customers the use cases that they need in their business.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Matt. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Pat, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the demand environment in DCAI across cloud, enterprise and perhaps your comms customers. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the inventory correction in enterprise being ahead of cloud. So do those comments kind of imply that going forward, cloud could -- the demand there could moderate or decline as we progress through the year, or if you can expand on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Great. Great. Thank you, Toshi. The -- what we said, clearly that we did see demand softening through the year in data center overall. That's a market statement. Obviously, we have more exposure to enterprise in China, which we believe weakened our position a little bit more in the year, but we're seeing those same characteristics now with the cloud providers as well. So we see all of them weaker in the first half of the year. We are, I'll say, a touch optimistic that China will come back and enterprise will come back more rapidly than the cloud. And with our stronger exposure in those segments, we believe that is a potential good news for us as we go through the year relative to competition. The networking space is one where we have very sustained leadership and strength in areas like vRAN and O-RAN are ones that our platform is dramatically better than competitors. And with that strong market share through the year, we also expect some level of softening there in those in the networking area, but not as much as some of the other segments that we would have. First half of the year, we expect to be down year-on-year in the second half of the year to returning to growth. So inventory adjustments, a weaker market in first half, recovery in the second half of the year is what we expect. Overall, and obviously, the relative position, we believe that we have is stabilizing and the markets that we're stronger in, we're optimistic that they'll come back a little bit stronger as we go through the year.\nJohn Pitzer: Toshiya, do you have a follow-up?\nToshiya Hari: I do. Thanks, John. Pat, you also talked about your focus and commitment toward value creation, you mentioned how you guys are pulling future investments from the switching business. As you look across your portfolio as of today. I think to your point, you've done quite a lot since coming back. Like where is the incremental opportunity as you think about improving the portfolio going forward and creating value? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And I'll just say here without being too specific and some of these things are under evaluation, discussion with customers and the best way to handle it. We're doing a thorough analysis across the portfolio. And I would say we are looking at every aspect of the portfolio, where we're getting good returns, where we're not. And we're making decision after decision to optimize the portfolio. And as you say, we haven't been hesitant to make those decisions inside the back. And we have a few more that we're looking carefully at. But we're also looking at every area of the business. Dave suggested in his comments, hey, can we do a better job with our line? Could we do a better job with our building assets? We've also discussed as part of the internal foundry model that we're making major steps to improve our automation and ERP efficiency to run the company more. Some of our people actions. We've been very scrutinizing and benchmarking ourselves against best-in-class in every aspect of how we run the business. So one-by-one, we're saying we're going to be world-class as measured by benchmarks in these areas and all the business areas that we're in, we believe they're strategically important and yielding good results with our shareholders' investments.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Toshiya. Jonathan, we have time for one last question please.\nOperator: Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. We\u2019re going to talk about the reception you're seeing with Sapphire Rapids. And in particular, it seems like it's a really good chip. But I think the price at the platform level is getting more expensive, DDR5 is more expensive. What's it like right now migrating to a more expensive platform and environment or budgets are under pressure, does that change the ramp relative to other CPUs that you have?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. And you are touching on a very important issue, the memory. And obviously, the memory pricing for DDR4 has collapsed, right, and making that pricing gap versus DDR5 very visible currently. That said, customers don't buy these platforms on memory prices. They buy them on TCO, right? The total cost of the operations that they get for the performance as they put them into operations. So memory price is one piece of that. But I'd also say DDR prices are expected to decline as we go through DDR5 price and the gap to DDR4 is widely forecast to decline, and that gap will diminish as we go through the year. However, right, you contrast that to the significant performance capability. And in some areas like AI, we're seeing five to 6x performance benefits. And when you put that into a TCO calculation, it's overwhelmingly positive. Security is not measured on TCO. It's measured on absolute statements of security and confidential computing. So overall, we are driving this ramp very aggressively through the year. We have strong demand of customers. We're ramping our factories quickly. And we do believe that we'll have a strong ramp of the Sapphire Rapids platform as we go through the year.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-up?\nJoseph Moore: Yeah. I also just wanted to touch on, I mean, you mentioned the migration of the AXG business into DCAI and CCG. Is that -- is there a change there in any of the priorities, or is it just a restructuring of where those businesses reside?\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. It's a restructuring of where the businesses reside. And as we move past this, I'll say, launch phase of those products. And we're now into the scale phase of those product lines. And for instance, discrete graphics, driving the attach rate and channel motions with our enormous client business. In the data center, bringing a broader portfolio across HPC, our Flex product line, the AI capabilities that we have that we're uniquely delivering through data center. So all of this is about is the efficiency and scale of those business areas. And we've been having numerous discussions with our customers about these changes, and they have been very well received. And I'd say all the products that we launched out of AXG, the Flex product line, the discrete graphics product line, the MAX product lines. All of those products are continuing forward, and we believe all of those will have strong ramps in their volumes, revenues and market impact as we go through the year. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, the opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. And clearly, the financials aren't what we would hope for. But we're also pleased with the execution progress we made. And as a result, we're confident in the strategic outlook that we have for our business. Though the macro is difficult. It was difficult in Q4. We expect it to remain difficult as we go through the first half of the year, but we're laser focused on controlling the things that we can and every aspect of our execution, cost management and transformation is in our hands and we are well underway in executing against those paths. So with that, we look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter, updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term. We made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year 2022, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expect of ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory. Accordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3, even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value. Today, I'd like to address three areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the New Year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders. First, on the macro. We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments. Having said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023. To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China. In the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year 2022. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year 2023 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome. Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory. For all of calendar year 2022, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult. Importantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened. And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment. We intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of 2022, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in 2023. We remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives. In the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year 2022, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year-on-year in calendar year 2022 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World. Our share in calendar year 2022 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate with first half 2023 server consumption TAM down year-on-year before returning to growth in the second half. While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions are further along than hyperscale. Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year 2022 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year 2022 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye. We see calendar year 2023 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today. This is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year 2023 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call. We are making tough decisions to rightsize the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments. NEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited seven businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings. We are also well underway to integrating AXG into CCG and DCAI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs. While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year 2022 did see considerable progress towards our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products, anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture. In calendar year 2022, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside. This includes the Board of Directors, with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as Chair. In addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced TikTok 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine. Rebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design. Our progress against our TV road map continue to improve throughout calendar year 2022 and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of 5 nodes in four years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Meteor Lake ramp in second half of the year. Intel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Progress in [TD] (ph) continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3 including prior customers such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS. We also have an active pipeline engagements with seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips. Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel 18A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks. In addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers. On the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of you as Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone. It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered event, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others. We are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AXG moves into DCAI, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments. Our DCAI road map only improves from here. Emerald Rapids is sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023. Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations. Further, our first efficient core product, Sierra Forest is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year-on-year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in DCAI at our next investor webinar later in Q1. Stay tuned for the invitation. In CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z790 chipset. In partnership with ASUS, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry. We also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of 2023. Meteor Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Meteor Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultra-thin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the Evo brand. The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users. Lastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year. Turning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year 2022, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server. NEX hit the key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake N and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year 2022. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in 2023. Mobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year-on-year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year 2023. Calendar year 2022 design wins, including supervision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units. In addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year 2022. Starting the year, navigating the worst supply-constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term under-loading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IBM 2.0 creating an internal foundry, evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally. As a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers, and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. We'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year 2024. Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value. We expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call. I want to remind everyone that, we are on a multi-year journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds, while executing to our long-term strategy. While I remain sober that, we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making. I can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate. Rest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so. We will, one, deliver on five nodes in four years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A. Two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp, introduce Emerald Rapids in second half 2023 and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024. Three, ramp Meteor Lake in second half 2023 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024, and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year. We also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will, one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year 2023, 2024 and 2025 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. Two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024. And three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including SCIPs and Chips in the US and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities. Before I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying, we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions. For our employees is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company. For our external owners is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equaled by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IBM 2.0. No. Yeah. And clearly, as we look at Q1, affected by macro significant inventory adjustments, and that's affecting clearly clients but also data center as well. And we do see that year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter data center to be down as well. And we think that's a macro statement across all segments across cloud, enterprise, government and uniquely China. Part of our more positive expectation for the second half of the year is clearly from our customers and what we've heard from them but also with expected some level of recovery from China as well. So overall, clearly, a major inventory correction cycle and coming after back-to-school and how do they refresh our customers clearly wanting to take more aggressive steps as they adjust. But that inventory adjustment is well below their sell-out rates. So for that, we do believe that we will see recovery as they have made those inventory adjustments, and we'll see the business be stronger as we go through the year. So overall, as we said, we saw the range $270 million, $295 million. We believe the sell-through rate will be to the lower end of that. The consumption that we saw in Q4 was well below that, and the consumption rate or the sell-in rate in Q1 is even more significantly almost 2x more significant below the consumption rate. Obviously, these are the macro effects that we can't predict, and that's what's taken us a bit more to the low end of the range. But clearly, as we've been working with our customers and channel partners, we've been monitoring very carefully the sellout that they've seen. So we're pretty comfortable with that range. Also, we would point to China and a very unique circumstance there as is well known. And we do expect that, there'll be some level of economic recovery there, particularly we forecasted in the second half of the year. And this is a topic that we continue to work closely with our customers. That said, overall, and as we updated on our PC webinar, we do expect that the long-term market is in the 300 million unit range. So as we overcome this inventory adjustment cycle, and some of this near-term economic. And I think as you heard from Microsoft, PC usage is up, , the number of hours per PC continues to be up. The installed base has gone up. So all of those factors give us reasonable confidence that post this period of inventory correction that will have a very healthy $300 million unit plus or minus market that we're selling into. Yes. Thank you. And I think the most important thing is what we just did with Sapphire Rapids, right? Our customers were anxious for a great product from Intel. Obviously, we would have liked it to be earlier, as we had initially estimated, but we are now shipping a very high-quality product with significant areas of leadership in areas like AI performance, power performance, security feature function, high-performance computing workflows that are 5x the competition and features in areas like confidential computing and security that are quite differentiated from anything in the marketplace. Obviously, share shift, right, particularly in the data center space, these designs were one a year ago, right, or two years ago. And so it takes some amount of time. And against that, we're seeing a very strong outlook for Sapphire Rapids ramp through the year, as I said, 1 million units in the middle of the year, so very strong demand from our customers. And the other thing, as we've indicated, is have we rewon our customers' confidence that they could bet on our road map. And Emerald Rapids, looking very healthy for later this year. Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest looking very healthy for next year. And all of those, I believe, are rebuilding our customers' confidence. And I believe with that, given the massive incumbency that Intel has, and I would just emphasize that even though we have seen the share shift in recent sell-in, the installed base is Intel, right? There's an enormous on some -- many of the cloud customers, 95-plus percent of their installed base is Intel that gives us a very strong incumbency that we get to renew as we rebuild our customers' confidence. So as you put all of those things together, yes, we realize that we stumble, right? We lost share. We lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year, and we're going to be building a road map that allows us to regain leadership for the long term in this critical market. Yes. Also, I'd just add, we do and Dave sort of implied it, but we do expect to do SCIP 2 this year as well, which is another source and also the credit center clearly there's motivation on the part of commerce to get that underway and the rules making in place in the near future and start to dispense funds this year. Also, I'd point to Europe as well. So it's EU chips as well as US chip. So all of those efforts are part of Smart Capital for us. We do believe that we'll have the capital necessary to meet both our near-term but more importantly, the strategic long-term investments. And that's what we say we're on track with IDM 2.0. We're on track with the capital, the builds that allow us to restore leadership in our process technology as well as have the factory capacity to both deliver that for our products as well as for our foundry customers. Yeah. Thanks, C.J. I'll start and ask Dave to jump in. We think about the capital budget with two lenses in mind, right? One is the strategic lens. Am I going to get back to leadership at 20A and 18A? Yes, am I going to make the capital investments required to do that? Absolutely. To some degree, do we scrub those? Could we look hard at those? Where can we save tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on those? Yes, we will. But we're not going to diminish from the capital required for strategic leadership for the long-term. So strategic capital, largely unchanged. The second bucket, of course, I'll just call it, capacity capital, right, and adjusting to the near-term ebb and flows of the business requirement. And, obviously, in this macro environment, that's been adjusted meaningfully downward and we're finding everywhere we can to squeeze our existing capacity more effectively to be more aggressive in terms of how we work with our equipment suppliers in those areas and doing everything we can to minimize the capital that's required for capacity driven requirements as well. And that's where the larger trade-offs have been. And, of course, in a business as large as ours, we have labs and buildings and everything else. We are scrubbing those like crazy as you would want us to. Dave, what else would you add? Yes. So PSG did have a very good quarter, has a very strong backlog, continues to grow. But I'd say the math that you suggest is quite incorrect, given the relative size of those businesses. So we'll happily offline talk a little bit more through that. That said, we did -- we grew less than the market last year and saw some share loss. We see that stabilizing this year. The key factor is better products, right? And we've just released that with Sapphire Rapids and getting great response and our announcement event on January 10 was a customer-centric ramp this baby product line. We had strong participation from all the CSPs, all of the OEMs, all of the ISVs, end users. So it was seen as a very strong event. This year, we'll be very much about ramping that and we'll see the improvements in both market share position as well as ASPs as we ramp that product through the year, and the confidence in the road map. And that will be the determinant, okay, you have a better product now, great. Customers are building it on an installed base. But do we have confidence in your long-term? So I'd say we've reestablished a very credible road map. You'll see lots of news coming from us this year as we start delivering on samples, et cetera, of the next-generation products as well as the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids with highly differentiated features and capabilities. So we feel like we've put the worst behind us, right? And we're now coming back to the front foot in this business area. And I'll say in a very customer-centric, ISV-centric way that delivers our customers the use cases that they need in their business. Great. Great. Thank you, Toshi. The -- what we said, clearly that we did see demand softening through the year in data center overall. That's a market statement. Obviously, we have more exposure to enterprise in China, which we believe weakened our position a little bit more in the year, but we're seeing those same characteristics now with the cloud providers as well. So we see all of them weaker in the first half of the year. We are, I'll say, a touch optimistic that China will come back and enterprise will come back more rapidly than the cloud. And with our stronger exposure in those segments, we believe that is a potential good news for us as we go through the year relative to competition. The networking space is one where we have very sustained leadership and strength in areas like vRAN and O-RAN are ones that our platform is dramatically better than competitors. And with that strong market share through the year, we also expect some level of softening there in those in the networking area, but not as much as some of the other segments that we would have. First half of the year, we expect to be down year-on-year in the second half of the year to returning to growth. So inventory adjustments, a weaker market in first half, recovery in the second half of the year is what we expect. Overall, and obviously, the relative position, we believe that we have is stabilizing and the markets that we're stronger in, we're optimistic that they'll come back a little bit stronger as we go through the year. Yeah. And I'll just say here without being too specific and some of these things are under evaluation, discussion with customers and the best way to handle it. We're doing a thorough analysis across the portfolio. And I would say we are looking at every aspect of the portfolio, where we're getting good returns, where we're not. And we're making decision after decision to optimize the portfolio. And as you say, we haven't been hesitant to make those decisions inside the back. And we have a few more that we're looking carefully at. But we're also looking at every area of the business. Dave suggested in his comments, hey, can we do a better job with our line? Could we do a better job with our building assets? We've also discussed as part of the internal foundry model that we're making major steps to improve our automation and ERP efficiency to run the company more. Some of our people actions. We've been very scrutinizing and benchmarking ourselves against best-in-class in every aspect of how we run the business. So one-by-one, we're saying we're going to be world-class as measured by benchmarks in these areas and all the business areas that we're in, we believe they're strategically important and yielding good results with our shareholders' investments. Yeah. Thanks, Joe. And you are touching on a very important issue, the memory. And obviously, the memory pricing for DDR4 has collapsed, right, and making that pricing gap versus DDR5 very visible currently. That said, customers don't buy these platforms on memory prices. They buy them on TCO, right? The total cost of the operations that they get for the performance as they put them into operations. So memory price is one piece of that. But I'd also say DDR prices are expected to decline as we go through DDR5 price and the gap to DDR4 is widely forecast to decline, and that gap will diminish as we go through the year. However, right, you contrast that to the significant performance capability. And in some areas like AI, we're seeing five to 6x performance benefits. And when you put that into a TCO calculation, it's overwhelmingly positive. Security is not measured on TCO. It's measured on absolute statements of security and confidential computing. So overall, we are driving this ramp very aggressively through the year. We have strong demand of customers. We're ramping our factories quickly. And we do believe that we'll have a strong ramp of the Sapphire Rapids platform as we go through the year. Yeah. It's a restructuring of where the businesses reside. And as we move past this, I'll say, launch phase of those products. And we're now into the scale phase of those product lines. And for instance, discrete graphics, driving the attach rate and channel motions with our enormous client business. In the data center, bringing a broader portfolio across HPC, our Flex product line, the AI capabilities that we have that we're uniquely delivering through data center. So all of this is about is the efficiency and scale of those business areas. And we've been having numerous discussions with our customers about these changes, and they have been very well received. And I'd say all the products that we launched out of AXG, the Flex product line, the discrete graphics product line, the MAX product lines. All of those products are continuing forward, and we believe all of those will have strong ramps in their volumes, revenues and market impact as we go through the year. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, the opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. And clearly, the financials aren't what we would hope for. But we're also pleased with the execution progress we made. And as a result, we're confident in the strategic outlook that we have for our business. Though the macro is difficult. It was difficult in Q4. We expect it to remain difficult as we go through the first half of the year, but we're laser focused on controlling the things that we can and every aspect of our execution, cost management and transformation is in our hands and we are well underway in executing against those paths. So with that, we look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter, updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you very much."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year. As outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near-term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term. We're executing well towards our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range. Q4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges, offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion. Net CapEx was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY 2022 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023. When we spoke at Investor Day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY 2022. As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of 2022, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control. Through reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile. Moving to fourth quarter business unit results. CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year-over-year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of 2023. CCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year-over-year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our Evo and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year-over-year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix. DCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially, with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year-over-year, driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million. While still under satisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year-over-year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs. Within DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year-over-year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year-over-year, through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog. NEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year, as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mounts Evans infrastructure processing unit. Despite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs. AXG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors. Mobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year-over-year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye, growing 35% year-over-year. Fourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year-over-year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year-over-year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue. We continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of 2023 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. Before turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years. This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy. The growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC. The change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 2023. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted towards the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners. Now turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, DCAI and the x lines of business. We see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year. While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter. We're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 30% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to OpEx. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points. We continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets. While we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At Investor Day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0 from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity. For FY 2023, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth CapEx including our innovative SCIP partnership with Brookfield. We expect FY 2023 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change. Adjusted free cash flow will be below our Investor Day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of 2023 and return back towards guardrails in second half 2023. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at Investor Day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Yeah. So you want to go first? So let me -- I'll start, and Pat's going to add some color. So on the $11 billion, we're expecting most of the business units to be down sequentially, double digits. We're not going to provide guidance for the rest of the year. But I did say that the first half is likely to be seeing these inventory corrections. The other thing I would just add is maybe color to position the year is that we're expecting Q1 to be the most significant inventory decline at our customers that we've seen in recent history. So it's -- if you look back over the last four or five quarters of reduction, this will be meaningfully higher than all of those quarters. So, obviously, that is impacting the Q1 outlook. Ross, do you have a follow-up? Yeah, good question. So, obviously, revenue is the most significant impact to gross margins. We obviously did not expect to be down at these levels. That said, it's a function of some significant inventory burn. So it's not necessarily a reflection of the demand in the market. So, obviously, we would expect that to ever at some point, which will be a significant lift to the gross margins. The other thing is, in the first quarter, we're going to have about a 400 basis point impact on our gross margins just from under loading, because of the demand softness. And we would expect loadings to improve once we get past the inventory correction we're currently experiencing. In addition to that, we have a number of initiatives underway to improve gross margins, and we're well underway. When you look at the $3 billion reduction that we talked about for 2023, $1 billion of that is in cost of sales, and we're well underway on our way to getting that $1 billion. And then when you start click it further into the $8 billion to $10 billion that we want to hit by the end of 2025, about 66% of that, two-third of that is cost of sales improvement. And we're getting a lot of that from our internal foundry model that Pat mentioned. We're already seeing significant opportunities to be efficient \u2013 more efficient between our business units and our factories. And I think we'll have a lot of things to say over the course of this year about areas that we see meaningful improvement. Also, we have smart capital that was modest in 2022, it's going to be more significant in 2023 and much of that smart capital does translate to a better cost structure for us that will help gross margin. So net of that, I feel very confident we will get back to 51% to 53% in the medium term. And in the long term, I feel very confident we will get back to 54% to 58%. And I think Pat said it in the past, we aim to beat that range. Yes. So let me see if I can -- obviously, we're trying to avoid guiding beyond the first quarter given the murkiness. I would just say we are very focused on the appropriate level of investment necessary for the long-term strategy of IDM 2.0, while being very thoughtful around how much CapEx we spend to manage our free cash flow. I think Smart Capital offsets will be pretty healthy this year, much better than last year. Partly, that's because we'll be fully along with SCIPs 1 with our partnership with Brookfield. We are expecting grant incentives to be a part of this year's Smart Capital offsets. And so those -- and then lastly, we do have already in place, the investment tax credit, which could have some benefit to us this year. So certainly, Smart Capital will be healthy, but we are being very prudent around our gross capital spend through the year. And we'll -- as we kind of progress through the year, we'll see how things develop, and we'll -- you can expect us to manage it accordingly. I think most importantly, we -- we did not expect to be at this revenue level, obviously, for 2023 when we talked about this, net CapEx intensity of 35%. And yet we still maintain the discipline to stay at or below that 35% for the year. And I think that's what investors should take away from that message. Yes. I think clearly, revenue is going to be the most significant driver of gross margins. We're a high fixed cost model. So we suffer the consequence of that, obviously, when revenue is declining, but we also get the benefit when revenue is expanding. And so what will -- what is currently a headwind does turn to a tailwind as the business recovers. The second most significant impact we have is the underload charges. So that's 400 basis points or so this quarter. And we'll make a determination as to what loading makes sense for the second quarter as we get closer to the second quarter. But we're doing this to be appropriate in terms of our management of cash flow. But again, as business conditions adjust, we will start loading the fab at a higher rate, and that will improve gross margins. I think beyond that, it really is around a lot of the cost initiatives we have underway. It's the $3 billion for 2023, and it's the $8 billion to $10 billion improvement over the course of the next few years that really will help drive the costs and drive the gross margins beyond just revenue and loadings. You took one of mine. Obviously, the OpEx area, yeah, is an area that we've really focused on and Pat mentioned the lab piece, which is an area -- one of the areas that we have found efficiency. And I guess the last thing is that we have seen our capital offsets be higher than our original expectation. We were planning for probably one-third of what we think we'll get in 2023 when we announced our smart capital initiative in -- at the Analyst Day. So that's obviously coming in stronger. Of course, Pat already alluded to the fact that a lot of that is -- Skip has turned out to be a pretty powerful tool, and this will enable us to do a Skip 2 this year as well, which obviously helps. Well, 2023, we were thinking was a breakeven free cash flow year for us back at the Analyst Day last February. Obviously, in the first half of this year, we're going to be below that model. But as we look into the back half of the year, we would expect to approach the model in 2023. And of course, 2024 is a bit away from where we are right now, but this is the thing that we spend a lot of time on. I would tell you one thing, if you look at our free cash flow for 2022, we came in roughly around minus $4 billion. If you remember in the quarter before, we forecasted that we would be somewhere between minus $2 billion and minus $4 billion. We were actually assuming a higher level of capital offsets, which is still coming, but pushed into 2023. And yet we still hit the high end of that range. And the way we did it was through working capital initiatives. So this is a big part of our strategy around managing free cash flow, is more attention to working capital. It's something that I think in the past may not have been a big focus here, but is a very big focus here. It's how we -- how our shipments are managed in terms of linearity, how we manage payments, how we manage our inventory. The fact that we're taking underload does affect the gross margins, but it also improves our cash flow, because we're spending less on variable costs. So these are areas that we think can be pretty beneficial to us and be a tailwind for us in terms of free cash flow as we progress through the year. Yes. Well, obviously, we announced a $0.365 dividend for the first quarter. That was consistent with the last quarter's dividend. I'd just say the Board, management, we take a very disciplined approach to the capital allocation strategy, and we're going to remain committed to being very prudent around how we allocate capital for the owners. And we are committed to maintaining a competitive dividend."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, operator. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We have also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite growing economic headwinds, Q3 revenue was flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guidance. In June, we were one of the first companies to highlight an abrupt and pronounced slowdown in demand, which has brought and beyond our initial expectations and is now having an industry-wide impact across the electronic supply chain. We are adjusting our Q4 outlook, and we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023. While we are not satisfied with our results, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can, and we are pleased that our PC share stabilized in Q2 and is now showing meaningful [Audio Gap] improvement in Q3. Our service share, while not where we want it to be, is tracking in line with our expectations, and we are encouraged by good execution in the quarter against our product roadmap. In addition, we are intensifying our cost reduction and efficiency efforts, and we are aggressively moving into the next phase of IDM 2.0 geared to unlocking the full potential of the IDM advantage. This afternoon, I will focus my comments in three areas: one, the key trends and dynamics that shape Q3 and are informing our outlook; two, the progress we are making on IDM 2.0, including our momentum on process and product road maps and our recent announcement that we are implementing an internal foundry model; and three, the actions underway to drive cost savings and efficiency gains aimed at accelerating our transformation. Specific to trends we are seeing, along with further deterioration in consumer PC demand in Q3, enterprise demand has begun to slow. We expect PC units to decline mid- to high teens to approximately 295 million units in calendar year '22. Our own Q3 results reflect a strong product portfolio with Raptor Lake building on Alder Lake's momentum as well as working closely with customers to optimize their inventory, our market share and business objectives. We are still shipping below PC consumption and the inventory correction continued in Q3, but not as quickly as we forecasted. Importantly, however, PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels. We are targeting a calendar year '23 PC unit TAM of between 270 million and 295 million units with a strong brand and product line driving additional share, especially at premium ASPs. The data center TAM is holding up better, although enterprise in China continue to show signs of weakness as to some but not all cloud customers. Across our infrastructure and industrial exposed businesses, NEX demand was very solid, though not immune from the weakening economy. PSG continues to be a true standout with record Q3 revenue, up over 25% year-over-year. PSG backlog is robust, and it continues to be an area where we are supply chain-limited. Despite the challenging business environment, we made solid progress toward our long-term transformation in Q3, and we remain fully committed to using the macro uncertainty to accelerate our efforts. Each quarter, our confidence grows in achieving our goal of five nodes in four years. On Intel 4, we are progressing towards a high-volume manufacturing and will tape out the production stepping at Meteor Lake in Q4. The first stepping of Granite Rapids is out of the fab, yielding well with Intel 3 continuing to progress on schedule. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFET and PowerVia our first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. IFS is a major beneficiary of our TD progress, and we are excited to welcome NVIDIA to the RAMP-C program, which enables both commercial foundry customers and the U.S. Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel's at scale investments in leading-edge technologies. Since Q2, IFS has expanded engagements to seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers, coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 35 customer test chips. In addition, IFS increased qualified opportunities by $1 billion to over $7 billion in deal value, all before we welcome the Tower team with the expected completion of the merger in Q1 '23. On the product front, we had a busy quarter. Within client, as mentioned earlier, we added to the strong Alder Lake momentum with the launch of Raptor Lake desktop in Q3, driving a more than a 40% improvement in multi-thread performance, unquestioned leadership in gaming, 6 gigahertz out of the box and record-setting overclocking. We currently have over 500 OEM design wins. We launched Intel Unison to deliver best-in-industry multidevice user experience. In addition, we saw a meaningful development progress across multiple OEM designs on Intel 4-based Meteor Lake with volume ramps in 2023. We now have all elements of the AXG portfolio in production with A770 giving our discrete graphics efforts a strong boost. The Flex family is building a strong pipeline of data center use cases, and Ponte Vecchio is now production of four HPC offerings and production blades deployed for lead customers. Combined with Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, PBC is the basis for strong traction with HPC customers like Argonne National Laboratory and Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. CSPs and telcos alike continue to move to software-based 5G, vRAN and O-RAN deployments. We announced Sapphire Rapids EE with vRAN Boost for in-line acceleration of 5G and network workloads. Edge and AI are proving a powerful combination for us with OpenVINO momentum building with customers like Chipotle, and we launched the Intel Geti computer vision software platform for RapidAI training with early customers such as Braven, Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals. Further evidence of our AI portfolio taking shape was seen by Red Hat announcing support for Gaudi, Cnvrg.io and OpenVINO. Inspur announced Gaudi 2 with Sapphire Rapids for advanced AI use cases. Amazon will be accelerating large transform models with Gaudi instances in EC2. This was also a very strong quarter for DCAI execution. Sapphire Rapids volume SKUs have now PRQed with a high-quality leadership product and a very strong volume ramp expected. Google gave the first preview of its C3 instances showing Sapphire Rapids capabilities as well as our leadership IPU, the E3200 or Mount Evans. We also saw strong milestones in the next three generations of server products. Emerald Rapids is showing good progress and is on track for calendar year '23. Granite Rapids is very healthy running multiple operating systems across many configurations. And with Sierra Forest, our first E-core product providing world-class performance per watt are both solidly on track for '24. It's obvious, but we're stating our strategy is only as good as our execution. We have been taking aggressive action to rebuild our execution engine, driving execution excellence across our people, design and development and operations. In Q1, I discussed our return to OKRs and their importance to our culture. Last quarter, I touched upon the next evolution of our tick-tock model, or tick-tock 2, as a disciplined approach to consistent, predictable product execution. This quarter, I wanted to spend a bit of time on operational excellence and discuss our recently announced IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office, or IAO, ushering in the next phase of our IDM 2.0 strategy. During the first phase of IDM 2.0, we aggressively focused* on making the needed investments to approve our TD roadmap to regain transistor leadership and to ensure we have at scale manufacturing capacity by building ahead on shelves. Improvements in both areas now enables us to move forward with our next set of priorities, evolving our systems, business practices and culture to embrace an internal foundry model and establish a leadership cost structure. This means we will create what I like to call a new and clean API for the company by establishing consistent processes, systems and guardrails between our manufacturing teams and our business units. This will place our BUs on the same economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have already identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. For example, product teams will be heavily incented to drive the high-quality A0 steppings, as they see the full cost of steppings, validation cycles, hot lots and capacity changes. Factories will move to rigorous capacity loading cycles, transparency of cost for loading changes and efficiency of capital utilization, structural and variable wafer costs. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. It will also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L into calendar year '24, ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are creating value and allocating your capital. A key benefit of IDM 2.0 is to unlock our full financial potential by capturing multiple profit pools not available to any one of our peers across architecture, design, wafer manufacturing, advanced packaging, supply chain and software. These pools were only partially long-term margin targets we established at Investor Day in February. Simple math would suggest there is meaningful upside to those targets as we execute and exploit the margin-stacking potential IDM 2.0 provides best-in-class semiconductor companies achieved gross margin in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s. And we aim to be best-in-class. This next phase of IDM 2.0 is a significant evolution in how we think and operate as a company. But just as we optimize to drive outside returns in the IDM 1.0 era, we will optimize to achieve best-in-class returns in the IDM 2.0 era. It's what engineers do, and we have the best engineers on the planet. Complementing and augmenting these efforts will be an intensified focus to reduce costs and drive efficiencies in everything we do. As we stated during Q2 earnings, we have an obligation to our owners to be good stewards of your capital. We are responding to the current environment by taking aggressive actions to reduce costs across COGS and OpEx while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation, ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. In addition to reducing near-term costs, we have also identified structural cost reductions and efficiency drivers, which Dave will outline a bit later. In aggregate, our efforts should drive $3 billion in annual savings in the near term and $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025. Not captured in these estimates are the start-up costs to support five nodes in four years which will begin to subside beyond calendar year '26, adding an additional $2 billion in COGS savings. Inclusive in our efforts will be steps to optimize our headcount. These are difficult decisions affecting our loyal Intel family, but we need to balance increased investment in areas like leadership and TD product and capacity in Ohio and Germany with efficiency measures elsewhere as we drive to have best-in-class structures. We will also continue to use our smart capital approach to support and inform our capital spending aspirations, aggressively building ahead on shells while aligning equipment purchases and installs with customer demand. We continue to see skips like our partnership with Brookfield as an innovative financial structure to more closely align fab build-out costs with fab output returns. Likewise, we see U.S. and EU chips as vital to enable us to establish a geographically diverse and secure supply chain for the semiconductor industry. We are confident in reaccelerating free cash flow growth and driving industry-leading free cash flow margins, which we get through this period of economic uncertainty affecting the entire industry and our own elevated investments to accelerate our transformation. Lastly, I was particularly pleased to join the Mobileye team earlier this week in New York to witness firsthand the successful completion of their IPO, especially in a difficult market. We believe that this will help unlock Mobileye's full operational and financial potential and is an additional avenue to create value for our owners. We remain committed to optimizing our value creation efforts through portfolio honing, reallocation of resources to higher returns, higher-growth businesses, M&A and where applicable, divestitures. Before turning it over to Dave, I want to close by saying I continue to be heartened and impressed by the dedication and commitment of all of our employees by far, the most important owners of this great company. They are passionately committed like me to reestablish Intel as a dominant driver of innovation and by the opportunity to improve the lives of everyone on the planet. It was also rewarding to see that same drive and dedication in the faces of our broader developer community at Intel Innovation, the rebirth of Intel IDF in September. We are the building blocks, an enabler of their vision and aspirations, and it is our commitment to them to be great partners and collaborators. Our ambitions are equal by our passions and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0.\nDavid Zinsner: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. We expect these headwinds to persist and as a result, we're lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter. We will continue to be laser-focused on the things that we can control and use economic uncertainty to accelerate our transformation and drive cost cutting and efficiency gains. Moving to Q3 results. Revenue was $15.3 billion, flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guide. Q3 revenue benefited from CCG's strength, offset by declining TAMs in DCAI and NEX. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, below our guide, but largely in line relative to lower Q3 revenue. Q3 gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially on lower inventory reserves. EPS was $0.59, $0.24 above our guide largely on lower-than-forecasted taxes. Adjusting for the lower tax rate, EPS would have been $0.37, $0.02 above our guide on better expense management. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. Net CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.3 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash balances of $23 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile. Turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $8.1 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by higher ASPs on better mix and also benefiting from our efforts to work with customers to maximize our share position ahead of Q4 price increases. CCG revenue was down 17% year-over-year as customers continue to reduce inventory and we continue to under ship demand. Demand weakness year-over-year was most pronounced in the consumer, education and small medium business markets. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, up $570 million sequentially and down 54% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product roadmap. DCAI revenue was $4.2 billion, down 27% year-over-year on TAM reductions and continued competitive pressures even as market share continues to track in line with our expectations. Operating profit was $17 million, below expectations and down significantly year-over-year. Profitability was impacted by lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs on transition to 10 nanometers. We also continue to invest aggressively in the product roadmap.  NEX revenue was $2.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year on increased demand for 5G, Ethernet and edge products, partially offset by lower network Xeon demand. In Q3, we started to see macro-driven demand softness and customer inventory management impact NEX. Operating profit was $75 million, down 85% year-over-year due to the impact of softer demand on inventory valuation and increased roadmap investment. AXG revenue was $185 million, up 8% year-over-year on the ramp of our Blockscale products. Operating loss was $378 million, $129 million better sequentially, but $156 million worse than year-over-year due to softer demand and product readiness impacting inventory valuation as well as increased investment to deliver the visual, supercompute and custom accelerated graphics roadmaps. Mobileye revenue was $450 million, up $124 million from Q3 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Operating income was $142 million, up $15 million from Q3 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. IFS revenue was $171 million, down 2% year-over-year, driven by automotive weakness with customers citing third-party component shortages, partially offset by growth in core foundry and IMS businesses. Operating loss was $103 million versus an operating loss of $44 million in Q3 '21 on increased spending to enable our foundry growth strategy. Turning to Q4 guidance. Given the deteriorating macro environment and based on input from our customers, we're now guiding Q4 revenue in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion with sequential decline driven by lower CCG revenue as customers reduced inventory lower NEX TAM and continued DCAI headwinds. We're forecasting gross margin of 45%, a tax rate of 14% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. For Q4 adjusted free cash flow, we expect to see a meaningful sequential increase driven by working capital improvements and a $2 billion reduction in net CapEx, adjusting for a lower demand environment. These benefits will be partially offset by lower revenue. And as a result, we're reducing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion. There is also a possibility that a portion of expected capital offsets could move from Q4 to Q1, shifting the cash flow benefit into next year. Consistent with our short-term financial model discussed at our Investor Day in February, our continued intent is to manage adjust this free cash flow at approximately breakeven as we go through this period of accelerated and elevated investments supported by our smart capital approach and the multiple pools of capital available to finance our strategy. Now turning to our long-term outlook and the changes we're making to transform the business. Beyond Q4, there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, and it appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession. Further, as I discussed in Q2 earnings, it's imperative that we drive for world-class product cost and operational efficiency to achieve our long-term financial model. As Pat detailed earlier, to accelerate this transformation, we're forming the IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office and doubling down on our efforts to reduce costs and find efficiencies across the organization. We'll start with a focus on driving $3 billion of cost reduction in 2023, 1/3 in cost of sales and 2/3 in operating expenses. Note that our Q3 results include GAAP restructuring charges of $664 million that reflect initial efforts to rightsize our business and deliver these savings. In Q4, we expect to have additional restructuring charges of similar magnitude as we further rationalize our 2023 financial plan. Longer term, we will execute on continued structural cost savings and efficiency gains, which we expect to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings by the end of 2025, split roughly 2/3 in cost of sales and 1/3 in operating expense. These savings will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business, including portfolio cuts, rightsizing of our support organizations, more stringent cost controls in all aspects of our spending and improved sales and marketing efficiency. As Pat outlined, also critical to driving this transformation is the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, dramatically increasing financial accountability and transparency, enabling all organizations to drive to world-class product cost and efficiency benchmarks. In addition, as we emerge from five nodes in four years and slower technology development cadence, we expect an additional approximately 200 basis points of gross margin after 2026. We expect these efforts to provide potential upside to the financial targets we provided at the February Investor Day. This will be a multiyear journey, but as Pat said earlier, best-in-class semiconductor companies have a financial profile that includes gross margins in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s, and we aim to be best-in-class. In the short term, we will continue to manage to the OpEx, net capital intensity and adjusted free cash flow guardrails established and drive back to a gross margin percentage range of 51% to 53% once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The compelling long-term financial opportunity of strong revenue growth across our six business units and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformation necessary to achieve these goals. With that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. As move into the Q&A session, we would ask each participant ask one question, and where appropriate, a brief follow up question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore : You mentioned, both Dave and Pat, many times about the macroeconomic weakness, likely persisting into next year. So if you're willing to talk a little bit about the puts and takes in the market. You talked about the PC market being down about 5%, Pat. But overall, from your segments, where do you see either market headwinds or tailwinds or individual Intel-specific areas for market share gains or still challenges into 2023?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you, Ross. I'll start off on that. And like we said, it's just the macroeconomic, unpredictable, tough market outlook. And inside of that, it's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon, inflation in the U.S., the situation in Europe with energy and the war and in Asia. So against that backdrop, we're still looking to have economic headwinds as we go into next year. And with that in mind, obviously, lowering our guide for Q4. As we think about it, at the industry level, obviously, some of that helps to accelerate some of the rebalancing of the supply chain, and some of that will help our business like lowering of DDR memory costs will decrease the premiums on DDR5 that makes Sapphire Rapids a more compelling platform. In other areas, we still have a rebalancing of the supply chain in front of us on some of the older nodes. When we look at our business units, the PC, more critical device than ever. And as Sacha talked about yesterday on his earnings call, 20% more active devices usage increasing. That said, we do expect that the TAM, as I indicated in my formal comments, is going to be a bit lower next year. We've given a range aligned with the industry. For servers, we have seen the slowdown in enterprise and to a lesser degree, in the cloud market, decreasing the TAM outlook there. We do, in our modeling, look at that as we're building our capacity. Obviously, our cost efforts have been very specific to give us flexibility for lowering the structural rate cost even as we stay true to the strategic investments that we're making and driving our transformation and disciplined cost modeling more quickly. So it really is a challenging environment, unpredictable environment, and we're staying true to the strategy, making cost adjustments and trying to balance market outlooks as we gain share, right, in some segments, and we fight for share in other segments. And I was very pleased with how the team executed in improving our execution in an environment that really was quite tough.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a brief follow-up?\nRoss Seymore : Yes. Just following on to that last part that you said, Pat, about some of the areas of share gains or share losses. Where do you think those will be most acute in both directions, the good and the bad?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. And we'd say we saw no -- if we go to the areas, we're just entering in the AXG business and IFS. So everything there is gaining share -- in the NEX business, we saw our businesses entirely driven by the macro. And our market share seems to have no real shift whatsoever, and we continue to be a grower in that segment. in and PC, we had very market share gains this quarter, very strong product lines, so we think we're well positioned. And in data center, we grew slower than the market. And as the product line gets stronger, we will be in a position to regain share, regain ASP, obviously, ramp the Sapphire Rapids. But we still see ourselves not in a position that we're gaining share yet and expect that will be the case for a couple of more quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri : I had a question on the internal foundry. It seems sort of like the first step in basically splitting the company into an external foundry and a fabless company. Can you sort of play that out? Is that the idea? And sort of how does this create value? I guess, I mean, obviously, if you look at GlobalFoundries' market cap, that's like 30% of your market cap. But how does it play out functionally, how it creates value?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. When we definitely view that there are efficiencies for us to gain as we go through this internal foundry model, where we see numerous areas in the company that were not as rigorous as we need to be. In factory loading, where we make lots of change in factory loadings and we would run the factories more efficiently or stepping aren't accountable, right, through cost modeling back to the business units, and thus, driving the high-quality A0 stepping. And stepping changes being fully reflected internally and the cost of those will make us more efficient. Leveraging third-party IP more aggressively will make us more efficient. And the combination of that is a big piece of why we're stepping to this internal foundry model, and we expect that we're going to start giving more financial transparency that way so that you can start to see the benefits in the margin stacking being realized of both being a product company as well as a fab foundry company. And that's what we're out to get with the structure that we're laying out. That said, we think that this tight coupling of the IDM 2.0 model is a powerful value generator for us, at least the three areas. One, the technology benefits that we get to have a rapid pace of technology innovation innovation and co-optimization between product and process. The second is the cash flows and balance sheet benefits that we get by having these internal to be able to drive the large investments required in the manufacturing network. And third is in the supply chain efficiency and flexibility being able to balance across the foundry and business unit structure.  So these three areas for us are ones that we see that tight coupling bringing long-term meaningful value generation to the company and to our shareholders. But we're going to do it against the backdrop that we are going to be benchmarking ourselves against the best-in-class in each area and that transparency, right? We'll provide more visibility to you, our shareholders, but also drive our teams internally. And an engineering, manufacturing team when they see benchmark that you're holding up against them, it just unleashes energy into the future. And that's the excitement that we are working to create with this internal foundry model. And as we've launched it this quarter, we're already starting to see the roots of that permeate through our teams.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a brief follow-up?\nTimothy Arcuri : I do just quickly. I guess just a follow-up on that. So like what's the line in the sand, Dave? I guess, it's a question more on cash flow. What is the line in the sand? I think before, you said that 2024 was going to be free cash flow neutral. Is that still the line in the sand where whatever you have to do, you'll do -- you'll cut CapEx as much as you can to be free cash flow neutral in 2024? Is that still the free cash flow line on the sand?\nDavid Zinsner : Yes. I mean we expect to manage in the near term, while we're in this investment phase to kind of a neutral free cash flow over the course of 23', 24 combined. Obviously, our long-term goal is to is actually significantly improve cash flow, and we still feel like the model we gave at Investor Day is the right model that we can generate 20% free cash flow, as a percent of revenue. And obviously, this year, I think we showed very good discipline on the CapEx side. We brought our CapEx -- I think when we started the year, we thought CapEx would be in the $27 billion range on a net basis. We've adjusted that down to $21 billion. But we still preserved what Pat thought was the most important things to invest in to make sure that we're ready to go as we launch new nodes, as we bring out the IFS business and gain more customer traction in that space. And then next year, the real protection on the cash flow now will be around these spending reductions. We have $3 billion of spending reductions we're going out to achieve in '23. No guidance yet on CapEx, but I would just say the model in the near term was to run essentially at 35% of revenue. And as Pat, I think, even mentioned on the investor -- at the Investor Day, we will manage to the model, and that's quite important to us. So we think we can manage both aspects of this protect cash flow, be smart around spending, but continue to operate our strategy and our roadmap to get to leadership on process and product, to bring out these emerging businesses like the foundry business and like graphics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\nVivek Arya : Pat, isn't it risky to plan for a $270 million to $290 million PC TAM. Then clearly, the market seems to be reverting back to pre-pandemic levels of 260 million or so. And since that time before the pandemic, one large customer has moved away from x86, and there have been share shift. So what is the TAM next year is more like 250 to 260? What impact will it have on your cost and fab loading assumptions?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. So first, the premise of the question, we clearly, over a number of quarters, we're above market forecast. That range that I described is exactly in line with the various forecast, our OEM feedback, the feedback from key software providers as well. So I'd say our range is now aligned with that industry range. Second point being that ranges larger than and well above pre-pandemic levels at that point. It is a structurally larger market. There's lots of units out there waiting to be replaced that are aging in the footprint, clear markets that are yet to have the PC penetration. So we feel quite comfortable. And as I noted in the earlier question, PC usage is high, as seen by Microsoft and their metrics, and our product line is positioned to gain share. So somewhat independent of the size of the TAM, we have a great product line, and our product line is also in our brand is well suited with a higher margin segments of the market that have been more resilient, right, to the market effects, low-end consumers where you've seen the biggest issues and our product line is very strong. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, stunning numbers that we're getting and well on track with Meteor Lake. All of that said, obviously, you have to make some assumptions as you build a factory network, and in the range that we gave has a lot of room inside of it. And as we're demonstrating by the near-term cost cutting, that Dave described, we're trying to build flexibility into our factory network even as we adjust the cost structure, which is largely a fixed cost structure. And obviously, as we're ramping into the next-generation products, we're building into our Intel 4 and 3 product lines and the costs associated with that even as we balance both the near term and the strategic agenda. So we feel like we're well positioned to manage and thick or thin. And against that, with a strong product line, we believe we're a share gainer in this industry, and we're going to be quite aggressive to accomplish exactly that.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a quick follow-on?\nVivek Arya : So maybe Pat, just following on to that. Do you think you are shipping to demand on the PC side? Or do you still think there is a channel inventory because as we head into Q1, that is often a seasonally softer period, but again, compares are very different this year. So I was just hoping to get your perspective on what the supply-demand balance is in the PC market as it exists kind of real time?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Our belief is that we ship below consumption levels. So in other words, inventory levels at the OEM and in the channels decreased over the last quarter. They didn't decrease as far as we were originally predicting. So, consumption was a little bit weaker, but we still saw inventories systematically going down across the various routes to market throughout the quarter. We expect them to continue to go down next quarter at both the OEMs and at the channel level. And the numbers I gave on the TAM model would be our consumption models for next year, which are below the consumption models of this year. So, a somewhat smaller number for next year but not dramatically different as we already said. So overall, I think we're getting to a better point of supply-demand equilibrium where we were way behind on demand and supply for many, many quarters in a row. Clearly, the last couple of quarters have been adjusting of inventory levels and we think that we're going to be in a better supply-demand balance situation as we go into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu : I'd love to talk a bit about like the very ambitious like efficiency plan you heard you've announced. And first, I'd like to understand the timing of it. The performance of Intel has been challenged in the last six months. Should we read that as a very reactive plan and you're basically\u2026 [Technical Difficulty]\nJohn Pitzer: Operator, I think we lost Pierre.\nDavid Zinsner : Okay. I can answer that. Just make sure we're live.\nOperator: Yes, you are.\nDavid Zinsner : Okay. Thank you. So thanks for the question, Pierre. Yes. So keep in mind, as we look at this $8 billion to $10 billion of efficiency gains that we're talking about, we're actually making a pretty meaningful down pain on those efficiency gains in 2023. We expect to get $3 billion of savings from -- versus '22 in '23. And keep in mind, actually, we have some fixed expenses that come on next year. So the cash savings is actually more like $5 billion of savings next year. Now as it relates to the 8 billion to 10 billion, we think as we exit the 2025 period will roughly be in that $8 billion to $12 billion -- or $8 billion to $10 billion range. And as Pat kind of walked through, we just think we've already identified a lot of different efficiencies that will get us to this $8 billion. But also, as we start to manage the business in this internal foundry model, we think we'll find and cover a lot more opportunities to drive efficiency and savings. So we'll update you as we progress over the course of the next three years and let you know how we're doing in terms of our progress, but we have very good line of sight on the first $3 billion and pretty good line of sight on the full $8 million to $10 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore : I want to come back to the internal foundry model again. Can you talk about -- it's very clear how it makes your foundry business better. From the standpoint of the CPU business back when you guys were on top in process, there was a pretty clear indication that it was the alignment of the device business with the fab that was kind of creating this really good outcome. Is there any trade-off that you make with this from the standpoint, looking at it from the standpoint of the microprocessor part of the business?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Thanks, Joe, and I'll start on that one. The simple answer is our job is to keep that One Intel synergy. And when I describe the three value vectors that I'm expecting to continue to really leverage around this technology collaboration, co-optimization of the microprocessor with the process technology is one that's high on that list. And we've made a lot of -- actually quite a lot of progress since I've been back driving that. And we're really seeing the benefits of that. And for instance, the great health that we described on Granite Rapids as an example about the momentum that we're seeing from Meteor Lake, there were clear examples. So I do believe that we're well underway at keeping that rich cycle of technical collaboration and co-optimization. But there's been many of these areas that I described that there hasn't been this intense accountability. Steppings were done too easily and without the quality A stepping. And some of that came through our stumbles as you went with 14 and 10 nanometers, but we lost the discipline of the understanding of what steppings cost and not just in the fab but also in the validation cycle. So we have to bring much more accountability and transparency to that. Also, we expedited all the time. While expedites are a good thing when you're bringing a new product to marketplace, but they also create fab in efficiencies, and the results of that are we're not being accountable for the fab efficiencies. Otherwise, our margins will be markedly higher than they are today. So to me, it's really maintaining the good things and the 3 I described, the technology benefits, balance sheet capital and the supply chain while driving a lot more transparency, automation, efficiency and the result will be, I believe, is a much better Intel for the long term, not just for the external foundry customers, as you suggest, but for my internal customers as well.\nDavid Zinsner : I would just add that we have six business units today. We measure them separately, but they actually do a very good job. In a lot of cases, they need to pull together to engage with customers, to develop products and so forth. And so I think we have a pretty good process and culture within Intel, where we can strike the right balance between creating some transparency and accountability for the internal foundry business, but also make sure that they're aligned to the overall Intel goals.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-up?\nJoseph Moore : Yes, I do. That's very helpful. In terms of the accounting in 2024 around this internal foundry structure, is the goal there to sort of have a transfer price between the foundry business and the rest of it, that kind of reflects the market price? Or just how -- it seems like the accounting of how you're going to determine where the profits could get tricky. [` Ends]\nDavid Zinsner : Yes, it's a good question. That's pretty much what we're thinking. I mean, we will have our own foundry business. So we'll have a good sense, I think, of the market. And so that's how we'll approach it. I would say in '23 it's going to be a somewhat light touch. We'll do this through mostly kind of spreadsheet-oriented analytics. Eventually, we -- and Pat's been pretty vocal on this. We want to create more automation, systemization of everything that we're doing between the foundry and the product. So over time, this will get more robust. And ergo, we'll be able to drive more accountability, I think, as we progress through\u2026\nPatrick Gelsinger : And just to add on to that a little bit, Joe. Here, this is a case where our internal processes and systems were optimized for IDM 1.0, right? We weren't having to say what is a sustainable wafer price that we should be designing against. And we were having a wafer cost view, right, which early in a process life is very high, right? And then it gets to mature, and how do design teams pick the right choice when you have such variability, whereas the foundry model gives a much more predictable wafer pricing that then enables a more efficient business unit model to pick the right technology choices to deliver the best products. So that's just one example that we're finding that we're not making the best decisions today, and this will allow us to hold the manufacturing teams to be entirely accountable. You've given a price hit the defects, you hit the cost structures associated with it and the business units, you have a wafer cost and go build the best product against that and ramp it like crazy in the industry. And obviously, presenting those with clarity will help you as the Street understand the progress we're making to accomplish that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse : And one more question on your Intel foundry strategy. It makes perfect sense to me around the discipline and cost that you're looking to achieve here. But if I'm a business unit head, and you've been pretty clear that you're playing catch up five node migrations over the next four years. If I'm a business unit head over the next two years, why would I not outsource completely? So I guess what are the guardrails to ensure that you're keeping capacity internally until you achieve the goals that you set out for 2025?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Maybe three different perspectives on that C.J. Obviously, most of the design decisions that are being made by my product teams now are '25, '26, '27 decisions when we're back to process leadership, right? And they're seeing that progress day to day. And just as I said, \"Hey, if you want to design the best product, have the best transistor.\" So they're with the capability to look now at the Intel leadership process technologies as they make those decisions. Also, secondly, as I described, this is a tight binding and we're going to maintain that tight binding of optimization and co-optimization for relationships that are decades old between our teams, by bringing in a new discipline to the boundary between them. And the third answer is we already use external foundries. This is a process that's already pretty well established, and we're using a range of external foundries. Our design teams over the last five years or so have learned how to use external foundries. And the fact is they're interacting now with my internal foundry, many of those learnings on expectations of PDKs, design tools, IP libraries are driving the expectations for what is required to be a good internal foundry, which will make my internal foundry a better external foundry as well. So I see this as a very regenerative cycle as we unleash these energies. And ultimately, I'm the CEO across both, and we'll be making good decisions to hold both of them accountable even as we clarify the interfaces and the efficiencies between them.\nJohn Pitzer: C.J., do you have a quick follow-up?\nC.J. Muse : Yes, John. I guess, Dave, as you think about the strategy, how does it change capital intensity for the business, not into '23, but perhaps say, over the next five years? Is it still that 35% type of number? Or how should we be thinking about it?\nDavid Zinsner : Yes. Good question, C.J. So obviously, in this investment phase where we're catching up on node transitions, what we do, we will have a higher CapEx intensity, this 35%. But we do expect, as we get out of this phase, to be back down to a more normalized level of about 25% CapEx intensity. So there definitely will be an evolution and adjustment. And that's one of the key components of allowing us to kick up our free cash flow to this 20% of revenue level that is ultimately the model.\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. And also just piling on to that, we also look -- we always look at that through the lens of our smart capital strategy, where clearly, we're viewing both the gross CapEx, but more importantly, the net CapEx from your perspective and how we access other pools of capital to be able to build that out in a very financially prudent way and those other approaches, EU, U.S. Chips Act, ITC skip give us a lot of flexibility, combined with the shell first strategy to be able to make sure we're spending the capital, the more expensive equipment capital, more timed with the market demand clarity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis : Pat, maybe for you, despite all the consolidation in the industry and the growth that Intel has seen and the larger foundries have seen, the capital intensity continued to seem to have moved higher, notwithstanding your hope that -- or expectations that it's going to come back down again. So given the high levels, you can make the argument that the industry actually needs even more consolidation than it has already seen at the level of the -- some of the biggest players in the industry. Can you share your thoughts on how you think about the potential for this large scale -- this kind of large-scale M&A or maybe joint ventures amongst the class of the leading-edge players? Or are they just -- are there issues like FTC-related or national security-related that just means that thinking about that kind of consolidation or joint ventures across borders is something that just takes it off the table and maybe it's a different analysis for consolidation versus joint ventures?\nPatrick Gelsinger : Well, there's a lot packed into that question. And I would just say, I mean, I generally said that, hey, we see this industry being a consolidating industry over time, particularly on the manufacturing side because of the extreme capital intensity, but also the incredible R&D costs, right? If you think -- if you want to have a world-class technology development team, all you have to do is spend $5 billion a year in R& D and do that for 30 years, right? Now you're okay. Now you're world class, right? And these are just extraordinary long-term investments that you have to build up and operate this way. And against that, I've consistently said I expect that there will be further consolidations in the industry going forward. Now what shape those will take, what the timing of those will be, what will be the trigger points that would position such moves, and as you said, there's many factors associated with that in terms of regulatory, legal, financial steps associated with it. But fundamentally, economics 101, right, would say you will see further consolidations into the future, and we believe that will be the case. And we would expect to be a consolidator in that process over time.\nOperator: And our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay : Pat, I wanted to ask a question about the server road map. We've got some, I think, relief from some of the commentary for cloud CapEx during this earnings season in the last three days and particularly from Meta last night, but the rest of the big guys as well. But on the flip side, there's some rumblings that maybe there's a couple of more months before Sapphire Rapids might ramp in big volumes. So I'm just -- maybe if you could help and level set us on the timing of big cloud volume of Sapphire Rapids and how that now dovetails in with the timing. It seems like you're keeping for Emerald Rapids in late '23.\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you. And as I indicated, Sapphire Rapids is now peer queued and the ramp is underway. We are ramping the product as we speak, strong customer demand. We expect this will be our fastest ever, Xeon to 1 million units, and we're going to push that quite aggressively, and the factories are ramping up as we speak. Obviously, this is good news for that business competitively, a big ASP uptick as well on the product. So lots of good things come. Also, we had a particularly good quarter on the execution front, not just Sapphire Rapids PRQ but great health on Granite Rapids, Emerald Rapids looking very good, Sierra Forest. So the next three generation products are all making very good milestones, and I really feel like the worst of our execution is behind us. And we're really starting to see some enthusiasm, momentum, excitement building in those teams as they turn the corner on these products. We do think, as I said in the formal -- that the market is softer, right, on the enterprise side and somewhat on the cloud side as you reinforced by some of the other comments from others. That said, as we ramp these products, it's all about having the best product to gain share, to gain ASP, to improve the margins of the business. And we now feel like our portfolio is taking share or taking shape to accomplish exactly that. And we're going to be aggressive. We're going to fight for every socket. This is a game where we have to reestablish ourselves in the marketplace. And now we're starting to have the product line to do that. And that's exactly what you'll see. In addition to that, we're also building out our software assets to have an increased value proposition. And one of those is, for instance, with Sierra. Sapphire Rapids is the market improvements in AI, but even more importantly, in security. And with our security services and capabilities, very differentiated areas like confidential computing are gaining quite a lot of interest in the industry for not just enterprise, but cloud customers as well. So a lot of things going on there. But overall, we feel like our momentum is being reestablished in this critical, critical area of our business and one that we know has a lot of attention from you all in the community.\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-on?\nMatthew Ramsay : Yes, John. One thing that piqued my interest, Pat, in your prepared script was -- I mean there's a lot of discussion of the five nodes in four years and halfway through that transition is 20A with RibbonFET or gate all around. So you guys are going to need to go through that jump. Your competition as well. And you mentioned, I think, some tape-outs of your own stuff but also some tape-outs of potential external foundry customers on 20A that seemed, I don't know, from the language used, kind of meaningful. So if you could give us a status report there on sort of the gate all-around RibbonFET progress you see versus competition? And is this external customer really significant.\nPatrick Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you. And on 20A and 18A, they go to RibbonFET, as you say. And Intel has driven every major transistor, right, in the volume production for the last 35 years. So the idea that we're the ones who are going to drive this major new transistor structure into production is something that we're pretty committed to be a driver for 20A, as you said, on track, on schedule. We expect 20A will primarily be an internal node, not one that we have a lot of external foundry customers for the external foundry chipset or tape-outs are largely associated with 18A. And a very typical process for a foundry customer will be \"give me a test chip of my circuits on your process.\" and that's exactly what we take out. The first one this quarter. We'll have several more in the pipeline. So now we're taking out not only our test chips for 18A, but our foundry customer test chips for 18A, and that's a pretty critical milestone when they see the results of the silicon for them making a volume decision for a foundry customer. So we're exactly on the time line that I described earlier for those tape-outs and those decisions. So as they start to see the silicon results, which we think are going to be very promising we think that will be a key step to them making major foundry decisions. And overall, this just affirms our five nodes in four years. We're making the investments. We're seeing good progress to get back to process technology leadership, which for Intel is a tide that raises all boats in the company. It makes our products better. It establishes our new business areas, positions us in a very profound way for foundry [Technical Difficulty] Economic environment. Macro, very challenged, but we're happy with the execution progress we made even though we're not happy with the reported results. And we know we have a lot more work to do there. It was also thrilling to participate with the Mobileye IPO in a tough market with very good results. We're prepared for the economic headwinds. We're making the necessary adjustments structurally as well as through our cost model to go through them. And we remain fully committed to being a value generator for our shareholders for the long term as we execute our 2.0. We believe that, that will be a great result for our owners for the long term.\nPatrick Gelsinger : Thank you for joining us for the call today and look forward to our update next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite growing economic headwinds, Q3 revenue was flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guidance. In June, we were one of the first companies to highlight an abrupt and pronounced slowdown in demand, which has brought and beyond our initial expectations and is now having an industry-wide impact across the electronic supply chain. We are adjusting our Q4 outlook, and we are planning for the economic uncertainty to persist into 2023. While we are not satisfied with our results, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can, and we are pleased that our PC share stabilized in Q2 and is now showing meaningful [Audio Gap] improvement in Q3. Our service share, while not where we want it to be, is tracking in line with our expectations, and we are encouraged by good execution in the quarter against our product roadmap. In addition, we are intensifying our cost reduction and efficiency efforts, and we are aggressively moving into the next phase of IDM 2.0 geared to unlocking the full potential of the IDM advantage. This afternoon, I will focus my comments in three areas: one, the key trends and dynamics that shape Q3 and are informing our outlook; two, the progress we are making on IDM 2.0, including our momentum on process and product road maps and our recent announcement that we are implementing an internal foundry model; and three, the actions underway to drive cost savings and efficiency gains aimed at accelerating our transformation. Specific to trends we are seeing, along with further deterioration in consumer PC demand in Q3, enterprise demand has begun to slow. We expect PC units to decline mid- to high teens to approximately 295 million units in calendar year '22. Our own Q3 results reflect a strong product portfolio with Raptor Lake building on Alder Lake's momentum as well as working closely with customers to optimize their inventory, our market share and business objectives. We are still shipping below PC consumption and the inventory correction continued in Q3, but not as quickly as we forecasted. Importantly, however, PC usage remains strong, demonstrating the increased utility and value of the PC and ultimately supporting a TAM well above pre-pandemic levels. We are targeting a calendar year '23 PC unit TAM of between 270 million and 295 million units with a strong brand and product line driving additional share, especially at premium ASPs. The data center TAM is holding up better, although enterprise in China continue to show signs of weakness as to some but not all cloud customers. Across our infrastructure and industrial exposed businesses, NEX demand was very solid, though not immune from the weakening economy. PSG continues to be a true standout with record Q3 revenue, up over 25% year-over-year. PSG backlog is robust, and it continues to be an area where we are supply chain-limited. Despite the challenging business environment, we made solid progress toward our long-term transformation in Q3, and we remain fully committed to using the macro uncertainty to accelerate our efforts. Each quarter, our confidence grows in achieving our goal of five nodes in four years. On Intel 4, we are progressing towards a high-volume manufacturing and will tape out the production stepping at Meteor Lake in Q4. The first stepping of Granite Rapids is out of the fab, yielding well with Intel 3 continuing to progress on schedule. Intel 4 and 3 are our first nodes deploying EUV and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFET and PowerVia our first internal test chips, and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. IFS is a major beneficiary of our TD progress, and we are excited to welcome NVIDIA to the RAMP-C program, which enables both commercial foundry customers and the U.S. Department of Defense to take advantage of Intel's at scale investments in leading-edge technologies. Since Q2, IFS has expanded engagements to seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers, coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 35 customer test chips. In addition, IFS increased qualified opportunities by $1 billion to over $7 billion in deal value, all before we welcome the Tower team with the expected completion of the merger in Q1 '23. On the product front, we had a busy quarter. Within client, as mentioned earlier, we added to the strong Alder Lake momentum with the launch of Raptor Lake desktop in Q3, driving a more than a 40% improvement in multi-thread performance, unquestioned leadership in gaming, 6 gigahertz out of the box and record-setting overclocking. We currently have over 500 OEM design wins. We launched Intel Unison to deliver best-in-industry multidevice user experience. In addition, we saw a meaningful development progress across multiple OEM designs on Intel 4-based Meteor Lake with volume ramps in 2023. We now have all elements of the AXG portfolio in production with A770 giving our discrete graphics efforts a strong boost. The Flex family is building a strong pipeline of data center use cases, and Ponte Vecchio is now production of four HPC offerings and production blades deployed for lead customers. Combined with Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, PBC is the basis for strong traction with HPC customers like Argonne National Laboratory and Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. CSPs and telcos alike continue to move to software-based 5G, vRAN and O-RAN deployments. We announced Sapphire Rapids EE with vRAN Boost for in-line acceleration of 5G and network workloads. Edge and AI are proving a powerful combination for us with OpenVINO momentum building with customers like Chipotle, and we launched the Intel Geti computer vision software platform for RapidAI training with early customers such as Braven, Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals. Further evidence of our AI portfolio taking shape was seen by Red Hat announcing support for Gaudi, Cnvrg.io and OpenVINO. Inspur announced Gaudi 2 with Sapphire Rapids for advanced AI use cases. Amazon will be accelerating large transform models with Gaudi instances in EC2. This was also a very strong quarter for DCAI execution. Sapphire Rapids volume SKUs have now PRQed with a high-quality leadership product and a very strong volume ramp expected. Google gave the first preview of its C3 instances showing Sapphire Rapids capabilities as well as our leadership IPU, the E3200 or Mount Evans. We also saw strong milestones in the next three generations of server products. Emerald Rapids is showing good progress and is on track for calendar year '23. Granite Rapids is very healthy running multiple operating systems across many configurations. And with Sierra Forest, our first E-core product providing world-class performance per watt are both solidly on track for '24. It's obvious, but we're stating our strategy is only as good as our execution. We have been taking aggressive action to rebuild our execution engine, driving execution excellence across our people, design and development and operations. In Q1, I discussed our return to OKRs and their importance to our culture. Last quarter, I touched upon the next evolution of our tick-tock model, or tick-tock 2, as a disciplined approach to consistent, predictable product execution. This quarter, I wanted to spend a bit of time on operational excellence and discuss our recently announced IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office, or IAO, ushering in the next phase of our IDM 2.0 strategy. During the first phase of IDM 2.0, we aggressively focused* on making the needed investments to approve our TD roadmap to regain transistor leadership and to ensure we have at scale manufacturing capacity by building ahead on shelves. Improvements in both areas now enables us to move forward with our next set of priorities, evolving our systems, business practices and culture to embrace an internal foundry model and establish a leadership cost structure. This means we will create what I like to call a new and clean API for the company by establishing consistent processes, systems and guardrails between our manufacturing teams and our business units. This will place our BUs on the same economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have already identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. For example, product teams will be heavily incented to drive the high-quality A0 steppings, as they see the full cost of steppings, validation cycles, hot lots and capacity changes. Factories will move to rigorous capacity loading cycles, transparency of cost for loading changes and efficiency of capital utilization, structural and variable wafer costs. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. It will also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L into calendar year '24, ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are creating value and allocating your capital. A key benefit of IDM 2.0 is to unlock our full financial potential by capturing multiple profit pools not available to any one of our peers across architecture, design, wafer manufacturing, advanced packaging, supply chain and software. These pools were only partially long-term margin targets we established at Investor Day in February. Simple math would suggest there is meaningful upside to those targets as we execute and exploit the margin-stacking potential IDM 2.0 provides best-in-class semiconductor companies achieved gross margin in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s. And we aim to be best-in-class. This next phase of IDM 2.0 is a significant evolution in how we think and operate as a company. But just as we optimize to drive outside returns in the IDM 1.0 era, we will optimize to achieve best-in-class returns in the IDM 2.0 era. It's what engineers do, and we have the best engineers on the planet. Complementing and augmenting these efforts will be an intensified focus to reduce costs and drive efficiencies in everything we do. As we stated during Q2 earnings, we have an obligation to our owners to be good stewards of your capital. We are responding to the current environment by taking aggressive actions to reduce costs across COGS and OpEx while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation, ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. In addition to reducing near-term costs, we have also identified structural cost reductions and efficiency drivers, which Dave will outline a bit later. In aggregate, our efforts should drive $3 billion in annual savings in the near term and $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2025. Not captured in these estimates are the start-up costs to support five nodes in four years which will begin to subside beyond calendar year '26, adding an additional $2 billion in COGS savings. Inclusive in our efforts will be steps to optimize our headcount. These are difficult decisions affecting our loyal Intel family, but we need to balance increased investment in areas like leadership and TD product and capacity in Ohio and Germany with efficiency measures elsewhere as we drive to have best-in-class structures. We will also continue to use our smart capital approach to support and inform our capital spending aspirations, aggressively building ahead on shells while aligning equipment purchases and installs with customer demand. We continue to see skips like our partnership with Brookfield as an innovative financial structure to more closely align fab build-out costs with fab output returns. Likewise, we see U.S. and EU chips as vital to enable us to establish a geographically diverse and secure supply chain for the semiconductor industry. We are confident in reaccelerating free cash flow growth and driving industry-leading free cash flow margins, which we get through this period of economic uncertainty affecting the entire industry and our own elevated investments to accelerate our transformation. Lastly, I was particularly pleased to join the Mobileye team earlier this week in New York to witness firsthand the successful completion of their IPO, especially in a difficult market. We believe that this will help unlock Mobileye's full operational and financial potential and is an additional avenue to create value for our owners. We remain committed to optimizing our value creation efforts through portfolio honing, reallocation of resources to higher returns, higher-growth businesses, M&A and where applicable, divestitures. Before turning it over to Dave, I want to close by saying I continue to be heartened and impressed by the dedication and commitment of all of our employees by far, the most important owners of this great company. They are passionately committed like me to reestablish Intel as a dominant driver of innovation and by the opportunity to improve the lives of everyone on the planet. It was also rewarding to see that same drive and dedication in the faces of our broader developer community at Intel Innovation, the rebirth of Intel IDF in September. We are the building blocks, an enabler of their vision and aspirations, and it is our commitment to them to be great partners and collaborators. Our ambitions are equal by our passions and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0. Yes. Thank you, Ross. I'll start off on that. And like we said, it's just the macroeconomic, unpredictable, tough market outlook. And inside of that, it's just hard to see any points of good news on the horizon, inflation in the U.S., the situation in Europe with energy and the war and in Asia. So against that backdrop, we're still looking to have economic headwinds as we go into next year. And with that in mind, obviously, lowering our guide for Q4. As we think about it, at the industry level, obviously, some of that helps to accelerate some of the rebalancing of the supply chain, and some of that will help our business like lowering of DDR memory costs will decrease the premiums on DDR5 that makes Sapphire Rapids a more compelling platform. In other areas, we still have a rebalancing of the supply chain in front of us on some of the older nodes. When we look at our business units, the PC, more critical device than ever. And as Sacha talked about yesterday on his earnings call, 20% more active devices usage increasing. That said, we do expect that the TAM, as I indicated in my formal comments, is going to be a bit lower next year. We've given a range aligned with the industry. For servers, we have seen the slowdown in enterprise and to a lesser degree, in the cloud market, decreasing the TAM outlook there. We do, in our modeling, look at that as we're building our capacity. Obviously, our cost efforts have been very specific to give us flexibility for lowering the structural rate cost even as we stay true to the strategic investments that we're making and driving our transformation and disciplined cost modeling more quickly. So it really is a challenging environment, unpredictable environment, and we're staying true to the strategy, making cost adjustments and trying to balance market outlooks as we gain share, right, in some segments, and we fight for share in other segments. And I was very pleased with how the team executed in improving our execution in an environment that really was quite tough. Yes. And we'd say we saw no -- if we go to the areas, we're just entering in the AXG business and IFS. So everything there is gaining share -- in the NEX business, we saw our businesses entirely driven by the macro. And our market share seems to have no real shift whatsoever, and we continue to be a grower in that segment. in and PC, we had very market share gains this quarter, very strong product lines, so we think we're well positioned. And in data center, we grew slower than the market. And as the product line gets stronger, we will be in a position to regain share, regain ASP, obviously, ramp the Sapphire Rapids. But we still see ourselves not in a position that we're gaining share yet and expect that will be the case for a couple of more quarters. Yes. When we definitely view that there are efficiencies for us to gain as we go through this internal foundry model, where we see numerous areas in the company that were not as rigorous as we need to be. In factory loading, where we make lots of change in factory loadings and we would run the factories more efficiently or stepping aren't accountable, right, through cost modeling back to the business units, and thus, driving the high-quality A0 stepping. And stepping changes being fully reflected internally and the cost of those will make us more efficient. Leveraging third-party IP more aggressively will make us more efficient. And the combination of that is a big piece of why we're stepping to this internal foundry model, and we expect that we're going to start giving more financial transparency that way so that you can start to see the benefits in the margin stacking being realized of both being a product company as well as a fab foundry company. And that's what we're out to get with the structure that we're laying out. That said, we think that this tight coupling of the IDM 2.0 model is a powerful value generator for us, at least the three areas. One, the technology benefits that we get to have a rapid pace of technology innovation innovation and co-optimization between product and process. The second is the cash flows and balance sheet benefits that we get by having these internal to be able to drive the large investments required in the manufacturing network. And third is in the supply chain efficiency and flexibility being able to balance across the foundry and business unit structure.  So these three areas for us are ones that we see that tight coupling bringing long-term meaningful value generation to the company and to our shareholders. But we're going to do it against the backdrop that we are going to be benchmarking ourselves against the best-in-class in each area and that transparency, right? We'll provide more visibility to you, our shareholders, but also drive our teams internally. And an engineering, manufacturing team when they see benchmark that you're holding up against them, it just unleashes energy into the future. And that's the excitement that we are working to create with this internal foundry model. And as we've launched it this quarter, we're already starting to see the roots of that permeate through our teams. Yes. So first, the premise of the question, we clearly, over a number of quarters, we're above market forecast. That range that I described is exactly in line with the various forecast, our OEM feedback, the feedback from key software providers as well. So I'd say our range is now aligned with that industry range. Second point being that ranges larger than and well above pre-pandemic levels at that point. It is a structurally larger market. There's lots of units out there waiting to be replaced that are aging in the footprint, clear markets that are yet to have the PC penetration. So we feel quite comfortable. And as I noted in the earlier question, PC usage is high, as seen by Microsoft and their metrics, and our product line is positioned to gain share. So somewhat independent of the size of the TAM, we have a great product line, and our product line is also in our brand is well suited with a higher margin segments of the market that have been more resilient, right, to the market effects, low-end consumers where you've seen the biggest issues and our product line is very strong. Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, stunning numbers that we're getting and well on track with Meteor Lake. All of that said, obviously, you have to make some assumptions as you build a factory network, and in the range that we gave has a lot of room inside of it. And as we're demonstrating by the near-term cost cutting, that Dave described, we're trying to build flexibility into our factory network even as we adjust the cost structure, which is largely a fixed cost structure. And obviously, as we're ramping into the next-generation products, we're building into our Intel 4 and 3 product lines and the costs associated with that even as we balance both the near term and the strategic agenda. So we feel like we're well positioned to manage and thick or thin. And against that, with a strong product line, we believe we're a share gainer in this industry, and we're going to be quite aggressive to accomplish exactly that. Yes. Our belief is that we ship below consumption levels. So in other words, inventory levels at the OEM and in the channels decreased over the last quarter. They didn't decrease as far as we were originally predicting. So, consumption was a little bit weaker, but we still saw inventories systematically going down across the various routes to market throughout the quarter. We expect them to continue to go down next quarter at both the OEMs and at the channel level. And the numbers I gave on the TAM model would be our consumption models for next year, which are below the consumption models of this year. So, a somewhat smaller number for next year but not dramatically different as we already said. So overall, I think we're getting to a better point of supply-demand equilibrium where we were way behind on demand and supply for many, many quarters in a row. Clearly, the last couple of quarters have been adjusting of inventory levels and we think that we're going to be in a better supply-demand balance situation as we go into next year. Yes. Thanks, Joe, and I'll start on that one. The simple answer is our job is to keep that One Intel synergy. And when I describe the three value vectors that I'm expecting to continue to really leverage around this technology collaboration, co-optimization of the microprocessor with the process technology is one that's high on that list. And we've made a lot of -- actually quite a lot of progress since I've been back driving that. And we're really seeing the benefits of that. And for instance, the great health that we described on Granite Rapids as an example about the momentum that we're seeing from Meteor Lake, there were clear examples. So I do believe that we're well underway at keeping that rich cycle of technical collaboration and co-optimization. But there's been many of these areas that I described that there hasn't been this intense accountability. Steppings were done too easily and without the quality A stepping. And some of that came through our stumbles as you went with 14 and 10 nanometers, but we lost the discipline of the understanding of what steppings cost and not just in the fab but also in the validation cycle. So we have to bring much more accountability and transparency to that. Also, we expedited all the time. While expedites are a good thing when you're bringing a new product to marketplace, but they also create fab in efficiencies, and the results of that are we're not being accountable for the fab efficiencies. Otherwise, our margins will be markedly higher than they are today. So to me, it's really maintaining the good things and the 3 I described, the technology benefits, balance sheet capital and the supply chain while driving a lot more transparency, automation, efficiency and the result will be, I believe, is a much better Intel for the long term, not just for the external foundry customers, as you suggest, but for my internal customers as well. And just to add on to that a little bit, Joe. Here, this is a case where our internal processes and systems were optimized for IDM 1.0, right? We weren't having to say what is a sustainable wafer price that we should be designing against. And we were having a wafer cost view, right, which early in a process life is very high, right? And then it gets to mature, and how do design teams pick the right choice when you have such variability, whereas the foundry model gives a much more predictable wafer pricing that then enables a more efficient business unit model to pick the right technology choices to deliver the best products. So that's just one example that we're finding that we're not making the best decisions today, and this will allow us to hold the manufacturing teams to be entirely accountable. You've given a price hit the defects, you hit the cost structures associated with it and the business units, you have a wafer cost and go build the best product against that and ramp it like crazy in the industry. And obviously, presenting those with clarity will help you as the Street understand the progress we're making to accomplish that. Yes. Maybe three different perspectives on that C.J. Obviously, most of the design decisions that are being made by my product teams now are '25, '26, '27 decisions when we're back to process leadership, right? And they're seeing that progress day to day. And just as I said, \"Hey, if you want to design the best product, have the best transistor.\" So they're with the capability to look now at the Intel leadership process technologies as they make those decisions. Also, secondly, as I described, this is a tight binding and we're going to maintain that tight binding of optimization and co-optimization for relationships that are decades old between our teams, by bringing in a new discipline to the boundary between them. And the third answer is we already use external foundries. This is a process that's already pretty well established, and we're using a range of external foundries. Our design teams over the last five years or so have learned how to use external foundries. And the fact is they're interacting now with my internal foundry, many of those learnings on expectations of PDKs, design tools, IP libraries are driving the expectations for what is required to be a good internal foundry, which will make my internal foundry a better external foundry as well. So I see this as a very regenerative cycle as we unleash these energies. And ultimately, I'm the CEO across both, and we'll be making good decisions to hold both of them accountable even as we clarify the interfaces and the efficiencies between them. Yes. And also just piling on to that, we also look -- we always look at that through the lens of our smart capital strategy, where clearly, we're viewing both the gross CapEx, but more importantly, the net CapEx from your perspective and how we access other pools of capital to be able to build that out in a very financially prudent way and those other approaches, EU, U.S. Chips Act, ITC skip give us a lot of flexibility, combined with the shell first strategy to be able to make sure we're spending the capital, the more expensive equipment capital, more timed with the market demand clarity. Well, there's a lot packed into that question. And I would just say, I mean, I generally said that, hey, we see this industry being a consolidating industry over time, particularly on the manufacturing side because of the extreme capital intensity, but also the incredible R&D costs, right? If you think -- if you want to have a world-class technology development team, all you have to do is spend $5 billion a year in R& D and do that for 30 years, right? Now you're okay. Now you're world class, right? And these are just extraordinary long-term investments that you have to build up and operate this way. And against that, I've consistently said I expect that there will be further consolidations in the industry going forward. Now what shape those will take, what the timing of those will be, what will be the trigger points that would position such moves, and as you said, there's many factors associated with that in terms of regulatory, legal, financial steps associated with it. But fundamentally, economics 101, right, would say you will see further consolidations into the future, and we believe that will be the case. And we would expect to be a consolidator in that process over time. Yes. Thank you. And as I indicated, Sapphire Rapids is now peer queued and the ramp is underway. We are ramping the product as we speak, strong customer demand. We expect this will be our fastest ever, Xeon to 1 million units, and we're going to push that quite aggressively, and the factories are ramping up as we speak. Obviously, this is good news for that business competitively, a big ASP uptick as well on the product. So lots of good things come. Also, we had a particularly good quarter on the execution front, not just Sapphire Rapids PRQ but great health on Granite Rapids, Emerald Rapids looking very good, Sierra Forest. So the next three generation products are all making very good milestones, and I really feel like the worst of our execution is behind us. And we're really starting to see some enthusiasm, momentum, excitement building in those teams as they turn the corner on these products. We do think, as I said in the formal -- that the market is softer, right, on the enterprise side and somewhat on the cloud side as you reinforced by some of the other comments from others. That said, as we ramp these products, it's all about having the best product to gain share, to gain ASP, to improve the margins of the business. And we now feel like our portfolio is taking share or taking shape to accomplish exactly that. And we're going to be aggressive. We're going to fight for every socket. This is a game where we have to reestablish ourselves in the marketplace. And now we're starting to have the product line to do that. And that's exactly what you'll see. In addition to that, we're also building out our software assets to have an increased value proposition. And one of those is, for instance, with Sierra. Sapphire Rapids is the market improvements in AI, but even more importantly, in security. And with our security services and capabilities, very differentiated areas like confidential computing are gaining quite a lot of interest in the industry for not just enterprise, but cloud customers as well. So a lot of things going on there. But overall, we feel like our momentum is being reestablished in this critical, critical area of our business and one that we know has a lot of attention from you all in the community. Yes. Thank you. And on 20A and 18A, they go to RibbonFET, as you say. And Intel has driven every major transistor, right, in the volume production for the last 35 years. So the idea that we're the ones who are going to drive this major new transistor structure into production is something that we're pretty committed to be a driver for 20A, as you said, on track, on schedule. We expect 20A will primarily be an internal node, not one that we have a lot of external foundry customers for the external foundry chipset or tape-outs are largely associated with 18A. And a very typical process for a foundry customer will be \"give me a test chip of my circuits on your process.\" and that's exactly what we take out. The first one this quarter. We'll have several more in the pipeline. So now we're taking out not only our test chips for 18A, but our foundry customer test chips for 18A, and that's a pretty critical milestone when they see the results of the silicon for them making a volume decision for a foundry customer. So we're exactly on the time line that I described earlier for those tape-outs and those decisions. So as they start to see the silicon results, which we think are going to be very promising we think that will be a key step to them making major foundry decisions. And overall, this just affirms our five nodes in four years. We're making the investments. We're seeing good progress to get back to process technology leadership, which for Intel is a tide that raises all boats in the company. It makes our products better. It establishes our new business areas, positions us in a very profound way for foundry [Technical Difficulty] Economic environment. Macro, very challenged, but we're happy with the execution progress we made even though we're not happy with the reported results. And we know we have a lot more work to do there. It was also thrilling to participate with the Mobileye IPO in a tough market with very good results. We're prepared for the economic headwinds. We're making the necessary adjustments structurally as well as through our cost model to go through them. And we remain fully committed to being a value generator for our shareholders for the long term as we execute our 2.0. We believe that, that will be a great result for our owners for the long term. Thank you for joining us for the call today and look forward to our update next quarter."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. We expect these headwinds to persist and as a result, we're lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter. We will continue to be laser-focused on the things that we can control and use economic uncertainty to accelerate our transformation and drive cost cutting and efficiency gains. Moving to Q3 results. Revenue was $15.3 billion, flat sequentially and only modestly below the midpoint of our guide. Q3 revenue benefited from CCG's strength, offset by declining TAMs in DCAI and NEX. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, below our guide, but largely in line relative to lower Q3 revenue. Q3 gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially on lower inventory reserves. EPS was $0.59, $0.24 above our guide largely on lower-than-forecasted taxes. Adjusting for the lower tax rate, EPS would have been $0.37, $0.02 above our guide on better expense management. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $1 billion. Net CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.3 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash balances of $23 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade credit profile. Turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $8.1 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by higher ASPs on better mix and also benefiting from our efforts to work with customers to maximize our share position ahead of Q4 price increases. CCG revenue was down 17% year-over-year as customers continue to reduce inventory and we continue to under ship demand. Demand weakness year-over-year was most pronounced in the consumer, education and small medium business markets. Operating profit was $1.7 billion, up $570 million sequentially and down 54% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product roadmap. DCAI revenue was $4.2 billion, down 27% year-over-year on TAM reductions and continued competitive pressures even as market share continues to track in line with our expectations. Operating profit was $17 million, below expectations and down significantly year-over-year. Profitability was impacted by lower revenue, higher advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs on transition to 10 nanometers. We also continue to invest aggressively in the product roadmap.  NEX revenue was $2.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year on increased demand for 5G, Ethernet and edge products, partially offset by lower network Xeon demand. In Q3, we started to see macro-driven demand softness and customer inventory management impact NEX. Operating profit was $75 million, down 85% year-over-year due to the impact of softer demand on inventory valuation and increased roadmap investment. AXG revenue was $185 million, up 8% year-over-year on the ramp of our Blockscale products. Operating loss was $378 million, $129 million better sequentially, but $156 million worse than year-over-year due to softer demand and product readiness impacting inventory valuation as well as increased investment to deliver the visual, supercompute and custom accelerated graphics roadmaps. Mobileye revenue was $450 million, up $124 million from Q3 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. Operating income was $142 million, up $15 million from Q3 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. IFS revenue was $171 million, down 2% year-over-year, driven by automotive weakness with customers citing third-party component shortages, partially offset by growth in core foundry and IMS businesses. Operating loss was $103 million versus an operating loss of $44 million in Q3 '21 on increased spending to enable our foundry growth strategy. Turning to Q4 guidance. Given the deteriorating macro environment and based on input from our customers, we're now guiding Q4 revenue in a range of $14 billion to $15 billion with sequential decline driven by lower CCG revenue as customers reduced inventory lower NEX TAM and continued DCAI headwinds. We're forecasting gross margin of 45%, a tax rate of 14% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. For Q4 adjusted free cash flow, we expect to see a meaningful sequential increase driven by working capital improvements and a $2 billion reduction in net CapEx, adjusting for a lower demand environment. These benefits will be partially offset by lower revenue. And as a result, we're reducing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to negative $2 billion to negative $4 billion. There is also a possibility that a portion of expected capital offsets could move from Q4 to Q1, shifting the cash flow benefit into next year. Consistent with our short-term financial model discussed at our Investor Day in February, our continued intent is to manage adjust this free cash flow at approximately breakeven as we go through this period of accelerated and elevated investments supported by our smart capital approach and the multiple pools of capital available to finance our strategy. Now turning to our long-term outlook and the changes we're making to transform the business. Beyond Q4, there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, and it appears that the current challenging market environment will extend well into 2023 with the potential for a global recession. Further, as I discussed in Q2 earnings, it's imperative that we drive for world-class product cost and operational efficiency to achieve our long-term financial model. As Pat detailed earlier, to accelerate this transformation, we're forming the IDM 2.0 Acceleration Office and doubling down on our efforts to reduce costs and find efficiencies across the organization. We'll start with a focus on driving $3 billion of cost reduction in 2023, 1/3 in cost of sales and 2/3 in operating expenses. Note that our Q3 results include GAAP restructuring charges of $664 million that reflect initial efforts to rightsize our business and deliver these savings. In Q4, we expect to have additional restructuring charges of similar magnitude as we further rationalize our 2023 financial plan. Longer term, we will execute on continued structural cost savings and efficiency gains, which we expect to drive $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings by the end of 2025, split roughly 2/3 in cost of sales and 1/3 in operating expense. These savings will be realized through multiple initiatives to optimize the business, including portfolio cuts, rightsizing of our support organizations, more stringent cost controls in all aspects of our spending and improved sales and marketing efficiency. As Pat outlined, also critical to driving this transformation is the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, dramatically increasing financial accountability and transparency, enabling all organizations to drive to world-class product cost and efficiency benchmarks. In addition, as we emerge from five nodes in four years and slower technology development cadence, we expect an additional approximately 200 basis points of gross margin after 2026. We expect these efforts to provide potential upside to the financial targets we provided at the February Investor Day. This will be a multiyear journey, but as Pat said earlier, best-in-class semiconductor companies have a financial profile that includes gross margins in the 60s and operating margins in the 40s, and we aim to be best-in-class. In the short term, we will continue to manage to the OpEx, net capital intensity and adjusted free cash flow guardrails established and drive back to a gross margin percentage range of 51% to 53% once economic conditions improve and revenue growth returns. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The compelling long-term financial opportunity of strong revenue growth across our six business units and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly make the transformation necessary to achieve these goals. With that, let me turn it back over to John and get to your questions. Yes. I mean we expect to manage in the near term, while we're in this investment phase to kind of a neutral free cash flow over the course of 23', 24 combined. Obviously, our long-term goal is to is actually significantly improve cash flow, and we still feel like the model we gave at Investor Day is the right model that we can generate 20% free cash flow, as a percent of revenue. And obviously, this year, I think we showed very good discipline on the CapEx side. We brought our CapEx -- I think when we started the year, we thought CapEx would be in the $27 billion range on a net basis. We've adjusted that down to $21 billion. But we still preserved what Pat thought was the most important things to invest in to make sure that we're ready to go as we launch new nodes, as we bring out the IFS business and gain more customer traction in that space. And then next year, the real protection on the cash flow now will be around these spending reductions. We have $3 billion of spending reductions we're going out to achieve in '23. No guidance yet on CapEx, but I would just say the model in the near term was to run essentially at 35% of revenue. And as Pat, I think, even mentioned on the investor -- at the Investor Day, we will manage to the model, and that's quite important to us. So we think we can manage both aspects of this protect cash flow, be smart around spending, but continue to operate our strategy and our roadmap to get to leadership on process and product, to bring out these emerging businesses like the foundry business and like graphics. Okay. I can answer that. Just make sure we're live. Okay. Thank you. So thanks for the question, Pierre. Yes. So keep in mind, as we look at this $8 billion to $10 billion of efficiency gains that we're talking about, we're actually making a pretty meaningful down pain on those efficiency gains in 2023. We expect to get $3 billion of savings from -- versus '22 in '23. And keep in mind, actually, we have some fixed expenses that come on next year. So the cash savings is actually more like $5 billion of savings next year. Now as it relates to the 8 billion to 10 billion, we think as we exit the 2025 period will roughly be in that $8 billion to $12 billion -- or $8 billion to $10 billion range. And as Pat kind of walked through, we just think we've already identified a lot of different efficiencies that will get us to this $8 billion. But also, as we start to manage the business in this internal foundry model, we think we'll find and cover a lot more opportunities to drive efficiency and savings. So we'll update you as we progress over the course of the next three years and let you know how we're doing in terms of our progress, but we have very good line of sight on the first $3 billion and pretty good line of sight on the full $8 million to $10 million. I would just add that we have six business units today. We measure them separately, but they actually do a very good job. In a lot of cases, they need to pull together to engage with customers, to develop products and so forth. And so I think we have a pretty good process and culture within Intel, where we can strike the right balance between creating some transparency and accountability for the internal foundry business, but also make sure that they're aligned to the overall Intel goals. Yes, it's a good question. That's pretty much what we're thinking. I mean, we will have our own foundry business. So we'll have a good sense, I think, of the market. And so that's how we'll approach it. I would say in '23 it's going to be a somewhat light touch. We'll do this through mostly kind of spreadsheet-oriented analytics. Eventually, we -- and Pat's been pretty vocal on this. We want to create more automation, systemization of everything that we're doing between the foundry and the product. So over time, this will get more robust. And ergo, we'll be able to drive more accountability, I think, as we progress through... Yes. Good question, C.J. So obviously, in this investment phase where we're catching up on node transitions, what we do, we will have a higher CapEx intensity, this 35%. But we do expect, as we get out of this phase, to be back down to a more normalized level of about 25% CapEx intensity. So there definitely will be an evolution and adjustment. And that's one of the key components of allowing us to kick up our free cash flow to this 20% of revenue level that is ultimately the model."

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speakers today, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Intel. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: You should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, Dave Zinsner. In a moment, we\u2019ll have brief remarks from both, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, please note that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such it involves risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We\u2019ve also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter and will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentations and the release available on intc.com include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. While we continue to make solid progress on our strategy, Q2 results were disappointing, below the standards we have set for the company and below the commitments we have made to you, our shareholders. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver of the shortfall, but Q2 also reflected our own execution issues in areas like product design, DCAI, and the ramp of AXG offerings. We have an obligation to remain vigilant and to respond to the changing business conditions while not losing sight of our long-term goals and opportunities. We will look to do both by adjusting and refocusing our spending levels in the near term, at the same time, as we accelerate the deployment of our smart capital strategy and improve product execution. Collectively, these actions will begin to show dividends in the second half of the year, allowing us to return gross margins to our target range by Q4 and maintain our initial free cash flow outlook for 2022. While still early in our journey, we remain laser-focused on executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. The current economic backdrop only strengthens our result and we are embracing this environment to accelerate our transformation. For example, regaining our leadership begins with Moore\u2019s Law and the capacity to deliver it at scale. Over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve taken the right steps to establish a strong footing for our TD roadmap. We are well into the ramp of Intel 7 now shipping in excess of 35 million units. Intel 4 is ready for volume production in second half of this year and Intel 3, 20A and 18A are all at or ahead of schedule. We\u2019ve received additional strong third-party validation for TD, IFS and our manufacturing group just this week when we announced MediaTek as our next major foundry customer, a great example of our One Intel culture. I want to congratulate our teams on what we expect to be many announcements as we execute to become an, at scale, leading edge, geographically diversified systems foundry. But we must also be clear-eyed as we look into the second half. We are planning for volatility as the world adjusts to the end of a two-plus-year pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus governments used to fight it. Across the economy, supply chain issues have both limited the ability to meet demand in some areas and driven inventory well above normal levels in others. We are prepared to manage through a slowdown typical of the normal cycles the semiconductor industry has experienced over the last 50 years. While the depth and duration are still difficult to predict, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust and succeed in any environment. Let me address some of the specific actions we are taking. First, we further sharpened our focus in Q2 selling our drone business and making the difficult decision to wind down our efforts in Optane, as we embrace CXL, a standard which Intel Corporation pioneered. These add to actions last year in NAND and the sale of McAfee. In total, we have now exited six businesses since my return providing roughly $1.5 billion for investments aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy. We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022, and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year, which Dave will address later. Importantly, expense discipline is not impacting the strategy and we remain firmly on track to achieve process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership in 2025. This goal is our true North Star. Second, our ability to invest aggressively and fulfill our commitment to a strong and growing dividend is anchored by the progress we are making in deploying our smart capital strategy. We are thrilled to see the bipartisan vote in the Congress this week and expect CHIPS Act to be on the President\u2019s best shortly. We have been integrally involved in moving this groundbreaking legislation forward. This progress, combined with the strong momentum in Europe, will reshape our industry and bring us toward a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain that we are uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from. Access to mission aligned pools of capital supports the accelerated pursuit of our strategy and will enable our torrid pace. Third, I rejoined Intel to re-energize and re-establish a culture of execution and innovation. With process technology and capacity expansion, both now trending very well, we have the critical foundation we need for improved product execution. We have rebuilt our leadership team now fully assembled for the first time. And together, we have reestablished OKRs throughout the organization to drive common purpose and importantly, a system of accountability. In the coming months, we will begin to share more with the investment community on the next evolution of our TikTok model to drive consistent and predictable cadence of process and design innovation. As we look beyond the near-term, the semiconductor industry continues to be at the beginning of a new structural growth phase, driven by four superpowers: one, ubiquitous compute; two, pervasive connectivity; three, cloud-to-edge infrastructure; and four, AI. Combined, these drivers support a semiconductor industry eclipsing $1 trillion by 2030. What remains very clear even during this period of uncertainty is the growing importance of Silicon to the global economy and to each of our daily lives. However, as a result of macro weaknesses, we now expect the PC TAM to decline roughly 10% in calendar year 2022, characterized by broadening consumer weakness and relative strength in enterprise and higher end skews. Importantly, our Q2 PC unit volume suggest we are shipping below consumption as some of our largest customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in the last decade. And along with some pricing actions should allow for sequential growth into the second half even as some customers manage inventory lower. While COVID-related dynamics like work-from-home and school-from-home pulled forward some demand, they also solidified the PC as an essential tool in the post-pandemic world. For example, PC and corporate usage remains historically high even as the pandemic\u2019s most acute impacts diminish. Markedly higher per PC usage and a larger installed base, including 600 million PCs that are four years and older, supports a PC TAM sustainably above 300 million units. Data center trends are still well entrenched. Data has been growing exponentially at a 50% CAGR for over 20 years, but until recently it has been uneconomical to turn that data into true actionable insights. With the advent of AI, along with CPUs, GPUs and accelerators, we now have the tools to access and use more of the data we create, driving significantly higher compute demand and a multi-year CAGR in the data center TAM of at least mid-teens. Despite these drivers, demand will not be immune from economic headwinds. In addition to match-set issues, which have constrained shipments for multiple quarters, increasing economic concerns are leading to a reduction in second-half demand. As a result, we have lowered our server TAM assumptions to reflect more modest growth in 2022. Against this backdrop, let me highlight key developments in our businesses: In response to supply chain and match-set issues, we closely collaborated with our customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. We rapidly adjusted to changing market conditions, made cost reductions and leveraged smart capital to execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy. Despite significantly lower revenue impacting overall gross margins, Q2 saw continued strong performance in our factory network, and we exceeded our wafer cost goals with 10 nm unit costs declining approximately 8% year-on-year. In TD, we continue to deliver on the promise of Moore\u2019s Law, and our ambitions to deliver 1 trillion transistors in a device by 2030. Intel 4 details were released at the recent VLSI conference to positive reviews, and we\u2019ve now taped in the first stepping of the Granite Rapids CPU and expect power-on this quarter. In the second half of this year, we plan to tape in numerous internal and Foundry customer test chips on various process nodes including Intel 3 and Intel 18A. In our client business, Alder Lake momentum continues. We have the strongest PC lineup in 5-plus years, and we remain unapologetic about our growing leadership and share position. We are building on Alder Lake leadership with Raptor Lake in second half of this year and Meteor Lake in 2023 exemplifying how our innovative design decisions can drive leadership performance even before re-establishing best-in-class transistor technology. In Q2, we launched the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors, the final products in our Alder Lake family. The Alder Lake family is now powering more than 525 designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and others. To date, we\u2019ve shipped well in excess of 35 million units of Alder Lake. Within the current market, we are also seeing relative strength in the premium segments we serve across consumer and commercial. We expect to build on this momentum with the launch of our next-gen product family Raptor Lake starting with our desktop SKUs this fall, followed by our mobile family by end of year. The Raptor Lake family will offer customers significant advantages, including double-digit performance gains gen-on-gen and socket compatibility with Alder Lake. And in 2023, we will deliver our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4 Meteor Lake, which is showing good health in both our and our customers\u2019 labs. Turning to DCAI, as we stated at Investor Day, over the next couple of years as we rebuild our server product portfolio, we expect to grow slower than the overall data center market. It\u2019s not a fact we like, but the forecast we see. We have a singular focus to regain performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud. The advantage of our incumbency position remains underappreciated and provides significant opportunity to drive outsized advantages to our customers. For example, we expanded our supply agreement with Meta, leveraging our IDM advantage to ensure Meta can meet its expanding compute needs. Also in Q2, we agreed to expand our partnership with AWS to include the co-development of multi-generational data center solutions optimized for AWS infrastructure and Intel as a strategic customer for internal workloads including EDA. We expect these custom Xeon solutions will bring greater levels of differentiation and a durable TCO advantage to AWS and their customers, including Intel. In addition, NVIDIA announced the selection of Sapphire Rapids for use in their new DGX-H100, which will couple Sapphire Rapids with NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper GPUs to deliver unprecedented AI performance. Beyond Xeon-based CPUs, we launched our next-generation Gaudi 2 AI accelerator in the quarter with a whopping 4x improvement generation-to-generation, and in the most recent MLPerf training benchmark test, Gaudi 2 has a substantial lead in Resnet-50 and BERT benchmarks. In the second quarter, we also began delivering on our software strategy with the acquisition of Granulate, expanding our platform capabilities with real time AI-driven continuous optimizations for cloud computing and the initial release of Amber, our security attestation service. Since we acquired Granulate, their customer pipeline has doubled and their revenue pipeline has tripled. Finally, programmable solutions achieved record 2Q revenue and was just shy of an all-time record revenue quarter driven by strong demand, including the ramp of the flagship Agilex FPGA family and improving supply. In NEX, we had an outstanding Q2. We achieved record revenue and PRQ\u2019d Mount Evans, an IPU we co-developed and are now beginning to ramp with a large hyperscale partner with additional customers in 2023. In addition, our latest Xeon D processors, built specifically for software defined infrastructure across the network and edge, launched at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress, and is ramping with leading companies including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. Across the network edge, we\u2019re continuing to see interest to deploy more compute and AI capabilities. For example, Ferrovial, a multi-national Spanish infrastructure company is using our edge computing, AI and connectivity technologies to deploy roadside solutions that can identify wrong-way drivers, warn of oncoming hazards and more. In Singapore, Singtel has deployed a network solution with Xeon, Smart Edge and OpenVINO to improve user experiences for use cases like entertainment, industrial, smart manufacturing, smart transportation and smart city. Lastly, ABB is helping utility providers modernize their electric grid and create a more sustainable energy market by adopting standardized rugged servers based on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon. NEX continues to clearly benefit from networks that are increasingly moving toward software and AI that is increasingly moving to the edge, and we expect another revenue record in Q3. For AXG, while we will not hit our GPU unit target, we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. In Q2, we started to ramp Intel Arc graphics for laptops and OEMs, including Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, HP and Asus. COVID-related supply chain issues and our own software-readiness challenges caused availability delays that we continue to work to overcome. Intel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will start to ship in Q3. Our energy-efficient blockchain accelerator Blockscale achieved a major milestone in Q2 with revenue shipments to our lead customers, going from tape-in to shipping in less than a year. We expect to ship millions of units this year, not originally in our forecast. Our data center GPU code-named Arctic Sound-M has started production and is now shipping to customers supporting a diverse range of workloads, starting with media streaming and cloud gaming, followed by support for AI visual inference and virtual desktops. In high-performance computing, we highlighted the installation of the Argonne National Lab Aurora supercomputer at our Intel Vision event in May, and we are on track to deliver over 10,000 blades in 2022, enabling over two exaflops of peak performance. We also announced new partnerships including with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to set up a pioneering RISC-V zettascale lab, and our continued collaboration with the University of Cambridge to evolve their current lab from exascale to zettascale. Our IFS momentum continues. Creating a geographically balanced, secure and resilient semiconductor supply chain as well as access to our transistor technology is driving strong customer interest in our foundry business. In addition to the MediaTek agreement that we announced earlier this week, we now have active engagements with six of the top 10 fabless customers across our offerings, including 18A. Overall, we are engaged with 30 customers for test chips, and now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $6 billion. Augmenting our organic activity is our proposed acquisition of Tower Semiconductor. We now have regulatory approval or clearance in four geographies, including the U.S., and we still expect the acquisition to close by early next year. In Q2, we also launched the IFS Cloud Alliance a partnership with leading cloud providers including Microsoft Azure and AWS and EDA tool providers, including Ansys, Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys. The IFS Cloud Alliance is the next phase of our accelerator ecosystem program that will enable secure design environments in the cloud, improving foundry customer design efficiency and accelerating time-to-market. Lastly, in Mobileye, we achieved another record quarter in revenue in Q2 and we continue to be poised to unlock further value with our proposed IPO later this year, pending market conditions. Mobileye\u2019s backlog continues to grow, with first-half 2022 design wins generating 37 million units of projected future business, compared to 16 million units actually shipped in the first half. As a result of Mobileye\u2019s high-definition map product, called REM, we are currently crowd-sourcing 43 million miles per day on average from approximately 1.5 million vehicles. This data is automatically built into a map, which currently covers greater than 90% of all roads in both Europe and U.S. which will support systems across the entire driving assist to autonomous vehicle spectrum. Looking ahead, before turning it over to Dave, I want to close with a few thoughts. First, after a very successful Intel Vision event in Q2, I am looking forward to hosting Intel Innovation on September 27 and 28, our core technical conference for global developers, architects and engineering leaders. I hope to see many of you joining me there. Second, as I said when we began our journey, Intel will be a source of innovation driving new businesses and additional TAM in large and growing markets. Taken together, we have already announced over 10 new revenue producing product lines so far this year, which are just beginning to ramp, and we expect to announce more in second half and calendar year 2023. The foundations for our growth story are taking shape. I know I speak for all of our employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead.\nDave Zinsner: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat referenced, Q2 was a challenging quarter negatively impacted by multiple factors. First, a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment impacted by inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Second, a much larger than expected OEM inventory correction as our customers adjust to this new macroeconomic environment. Third, worse than expected COVID driven demand reductions and supply dislocations in China and other parts of the supply chain. Due to the difficult macroeconomic environment together with our own execution challenges, our results for the quarter were well below expectations and necessitate a significant revision to our full-year financial guidance. That said, we are taking the actions necessary to maintain our prior full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance, including a slowdown in hiring, CapEx reductions and the expectation for increased capital offsets consistent with our smart capital strategy. We remain fully committed to the business strategy and long-term financial model presented during this year\u2019s investor meeting in February. Revenue was $15.3 billion, 15% below our original Q2 guidance as our CCG and DCAI businesses both underperformed our expectations. Note that even in this challenging environment, our NEX and Mobileye businesses achieved all-time record quarterly revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45%, 600 basis points below guidance on lower revenue and Sapphire Rapids preproduction charges offset by lower manufacturing cost. EPS was $0.29, $0.41 below our guide on lower revenue and gross profit, offset by lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $800 million. CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments of $27.5 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment grade credit profile. Now turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $7.7 billion, below expectations and down 25% year-over-year on global TAM weakness, particularly in the consumer, education and small/medium business markets. The shortfall was also driven by OEM inventory reductions as we worked with our customers to lower their inventory, protect market share and continue to manage through matched set constraints. CPU ASP\u2019s were up 11% year-over-year on a richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 73% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10 nanometer and Intel 7 mix, and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform roadmap. DCAI revenue was $4.6 billion, below expectations and down 16% year-over-year on OEM inventory reductions, mix related ASP decline and competitive pressures. Operating profit was $214 million, down 90% year-over-year on lower revenue, higher advanced node startup cost, increased investment in the product roadmap and Sapphire Rapids pre-production charges. NEX achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year on strength and data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G. Operating profit was $241 million, down 60% year \u2013 year on mix shift to networking Ethernet and 5G. Increased investment in process technology and lower sell through of reserved inventory. AXG revenue was $186 million, up 5% year-over-year on the ramp of Super Compute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $507 million versus an operating loss of $168 million in Q2 2021 with the increase driven by inventory reserves on Ponte Vecchio and Alchemist products and increased investment to deliver the roadmap of Visual, Super Compute and Custom Accelerated Graphics Products. Mobileye achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $460 million, up 41% year-over-year. Outperforming the rate of increase of global automotive production, which was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating profit was $190 million, up 43% year-over-year on higher revenue partially offset by increased investment in next generation ADAS products. IFS revenue was $122 million, down 54% year-over-year driven by lower mask tool sales as well as revenue decrease in the automotive segment due to customer shortages in the automotive market. Operating loss was $155 million versus as an operating profit of $52 million in Q2 2021, driven by lower revenue and increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. Before we transition to full year and Q3 guidance, after six months on the job let me provide my perspectives on the opportunities I see and focus areas to improve our financial performance and achieve our long-term goals. At the highest level, I see opportunities to improve in two areas. First, ensuring we are allocating our capital to the programs that are clearly aligned to our revised business strategy and generate maximum long-term value to our shareholders. As Pat mentioned, two good examples of continuing to optimize our portfolio are exiting the Optane and drone businesses. We continue to deeply evaluate all opportunities to more narrowly focus our resources on the highest value programs, increasing the probability of success for each of these programs. Second driving structural product cost and operational expense efficiency across the company taking full advantage of our IDM 2.0 strategy. A major focus for me is driving Intel the world class product cost. Key to this is executing our five nodes and four-year strategy, but there are many more aspects to achieving this goal with programs in flight to dramatically reduce product cost. Likewise, there are opportunities in OpEx to ensure we are achieving world class efficiency in everything we do. With my history in the memory business where every penny counts, I know there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar. As part of these focus areas, we expect to see restructuring charges in Q3, and I\u2019ll continue to provide regular updates on these efforts. Moving to our full year and Q3 guidance. For the remainder of the year we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to soften with the potential for a recessionary scenario to materialize. There\u2019s also risk for continued COVID related impacts on demand and the supply chain to continue throughout the year. As a result of this high level of uncertainty for moving to a range-based approach to revenue guidance for the rest of the year. For full year revenue we are now guiding a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from our prior guidance of $76 billion driven by lower expectations for our CCG and DCAI businesses. More specifically in our PC business as Pat discussed, we now see TAM decreasing approximately 10% year-over-year due to the softening macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year due to seasonal strength, OEM inventory returning to balance levels, inflation related price increases to take effect and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products to position us to compete for share. For DCAI, we expect to see second half revenue growth relative to Q2 levels, but growth will remain muted as competitive and macroeconomic headwinds persist, OEM inventory reductions continue and component constraints impact certain segments. For NEX we expect another record quarter in Q3 and continued growth throughout the year. NEX revenue tailwinds will be fueled by new product introductions, data center and Telco Networking demand and continued improvement in pricing and component supply. For AXG we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. And finally, we expect to see second-half growth in each of our two remaining businesses Mobileye and IFS as they ramp new products and secure new customers. Full year gross margin we\u2019re guiding to 49% at the midpoint of revenue guidance with the expectation that gross margin will return to the low end of our target range of 51% to 53% in Q4 as revenue increases, we achieve scale on new product ramps and cost continue to improve. We\u2019re forecasting a tax rate of approximately 8% and EPS of $2.30 at the midpoint of the revenue guidance. For net CapEx we\u2019re revising down our forecast to $23 billion, $4 billion less than our previous guidance as we moderately adjust our investment and capacity and take advantage of potentially larger than originally forecast capital assets, highlighting significant progress on our smart capital strategy. We expect these actions to offset lower than originally forecast operating cash flow, allowing us to reaffirm adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to negative $2 billion for the year. Finally, we paid dividends of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year and remain committed to growing the dividend over time. Now moving to Q3 guidance; given the aforementioned market environment, we\u2019re guiding revenue of $15 billion to $16 billion. At the midpoint of the revenue guidance we\u2019re guiding gross margin of 46.5%, a tax rate of 13% and earnings per share of $0.35. In closing the market turbulence and updated outlook are disappointing. However, we believe our turnaround is clearly taking shape and expect Q2 and Q3 to be the financial bottom for the company. We remain completely committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The long-term financial opportunity of compelling revenue growth and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly the transformations necessary to achieve these goals. With that let me turn it back over to John and get your questions.\nJohn Pitzer: All right. Thank you, Dave. Moving on now to the Q&A as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question.  Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for my question your implied guidance calls for roughly 12% sequential growth into December. Would love to hear what gives you confidence that inventory correction and the supply chain issues will be behind you? And as part of that do you think a PC TAM of down 10% is conservative enough or is that something where there might be further risk ahead? Thanks so much.\nPat Gelsinger: Thanks, C.J. So when you look at the fourth quarter, first of all we are at this point given the inventory burns in both CCG and DCAI shipping at below the rate of consumption for those markets. And so there is a natural recovery that occurs that we would expect as we progress through the rest of the year once inventory is in a good place. So we do feel we\u2019re at the bottom here in terms of revenue in the Q2, Q3 time frame and Q4 would recover just based on that alone. I\u2019d say the other thing is we\u2019ve got a good set of products coming out over the course the second half of the year. And I think that we\u2019re kind of operating with winded our sales in terms of product offerings in all of our businesses. And then third, we are increasing pricing. The pricing generally takes effect in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve gone a fair amount of time. The advantage of the IDM strategy is we can absorb a lot of inflationary impacts that others can\u2019t. And so we were able to kind of go a bit longer in terms of the price increases, but at this point now that some of those pricing increase or inflationary increases have turned out to be more permanent where there\u2019s a certain amount of asset we do need to pass-on to the customers and they\u2019re comfortable to do that. And so that also is a factor. And then lastly, I would just say the fourth quarter is generally just a seasonally strong quarter for us and particularly in the PC space. So I think all those factors give us really good confidence that Q2, Q3 represent the bottom for revenue and that fourth quarter we\u2019ll see some strength.\nDave Zinsner: And in fourth quarter, we also see that some of the new business unit areas, right, are started to contribute more significantly as well. On the PC TAM, before we were above the market and with our down revision, we\u2019re now exactly in line with the market. We were over 350 million units before, now market ranges are 310 to 325. Our range is consistent with that, C.J. So we don\u2019t see ourself ahead of the market like we were before, we were more optimistic. Now we\u2019re firmly in line with the market. Clearly, the market has shifted heavily on the consumer side, but the remains strength on the enterprise side, which also gives us confidence. So in addition to the strength of the product roadmap, which Dave said, we also see the enterprise market remaining very healthy and our position and the higher price points and the enterprise, these are good markets for us. And as we\u2019re on the back of Alder Lake over 35 million units, Raptor Lake ramping, we\u2019re just coming into a great cycle of the overall business. We\u2019d also say that the PC is strong as that work from home, school from home device usage numbers are up significantly for the time that people use their PCs. We also have a strong replacement cycle in front of us. We now have over 600 million PCs that are over four years old. We\u2019re definitely seeing that roll through the enterprise markets, again where we have stronger market share and better ASPs. So all that taken together, we think we\u2019ve ranged it and that\u2019s consistent with the financial guidance that we\u2019ve given you for the rest of the year.\nC.J. Muse: Thanks so much.\nOperator: We have a question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: So thanks for taking my question. Pat, I\u2019m curious why didn\u2019t Intel choose to negatively pre-announce given the extent of the shortfall. I mean, I can understand the PC market being weak but for data center to be almost 25% below expectations. That seems very strange to me. So I\u2019m just curious why Intel took these actions? And then when we look at your data center revenue, especially in the reported quarters, most enterprise and cloud customers reported their sales and spending kind of in line with expectations. So is it mostly competitive pressures? If you could just help us understand what the thought process was for Q2? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think that officially is actually two questions, but anyway, I\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ll take them both. On the market side, we\u2019ll say we were well into the quarter and we saw the market characteristics change quite suddenly, right, and that resulted in both the sell-through and the marketplace, but also these significant inventory adjustments. We worked with our customers on those inventory adjustments. And as we said, these are like once in 10-year kind of inventory adjustments, because the customers were working through the quarter, catching up to demand that was short for years, right? And all of a sudden as we saw that shifting, they took quite significant adjustments to their inventory positions. And we wanted to be in a position that we had some thoughtful view of what the market was for the future. So that\u2019s the reason that brought us to today. We think that we\u2019ve given you a clear view of where the market is coming into the future. The DCAI point, as I said in my formal comments, we were disappointed. Some of that was driven by the macro; it was also match set issues that we\u2019ve been struggling with as well. And Ethernet components, power supply components, et cetera have been challenged. But as we also said, we had some of our own unique execution issues and we kept the quality bar high on Sapphire Rapids and thus we did another stepping, which was a forecast, which put some inventory and reserve issues in front of us as opposed to high ASP new product revenue. So some of those things were unique issues to us that we were addressing. That said, we do feel like the progress in the data center, right, is clear in front of us. We have \u2013 Emerald is looking very good. We\u2019ll be powering on Sapphire or Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids shortly. All of that taken together, we feel our competitive position is improving. We also see that we know where the market share is and wins like we announced with AWS and Meta, we are going to focus on every socket, every workload, every customer quite aggressively on both AWS and Meta. These were substantial wins for us this quarter and we\u2019re hoped to be announcing several others like that as we go forward. We\u2019re also bringing new capabilities as we sort of said in our formal comments. The size of our footprint here is underappreciated, and we\u2019re going to be focusing on really benefiting from that and bringing new capabilities against that enormous footprint with capabilities like Granulate and our Amber security service, things that allow us to bring more value to our customers as well as harvest more revenue from that enormous installed base. So all of that taken together, we feel like we are owning up to the challenges that we had in data center, but have a clear view of how we write this business for the future and are well underway and doing exactly that.\nDave Zinsner: And maybe I\u2019ll just add in terms of profitability it was disappointing where operating margins landed for the DCAI business for sure. That was largely the impact of the decline in revenue. But keep in mind, we\u2019re also investing a lot for all the reasons that Pat said to get to bring out great products that allow our customers and, and so that investment does also weigh down on the operating profitability of the business. We do see that getting better. We took this, Pat mentioned reserves on Sapphire Rapids and those are kind of a one off thing that dissipate as we go through the second half of the year we also expect revenue to improve as we progress through the year. Those things combined should improve operating margins in near term. In the long term, we see this business as a business that gives us greater than corporate average operating margins, gross margins and operating margins for that matter, it has traditionally actually for us and for the industry. And so, it\u2019s a matter of just putting our nose down and executing to get those results. And we feel very confident we\u2019ll get there.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. Good afternoon. I guess Pat, I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the prior question in the server business, particularly on the roadmap you guys just mentioned, some reserves we need to take for Sapphire and the timelines have been pushed out. So I guess the questions are: one, Pat can you give us a more specific timing on where things are with Sapphire Rapids not just early units, but actual volume production. And secondly, does this push out \u2013 how does this impact the timelines for Emerald and Granite? Do you see those pushing out sort of congruent with the push out here or are those timelines going to be held and maybe the platforms be a little bit different? I\u2019m just curious on the roadmap. Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And giving a bit more detail on Sapphire, we\u2019re already ramping a number of SKUs of Sapphire rapids already. They began ramping last quarter. So, we have a number of those ramping. The particular issue that we highlighted, wasn\u2019t affecting those SKUs, so those continue to ramp. So we did another tape out, which I\u2019ll say for the larger volume skews, and those will be volume shipping in the second half of the year. So you\u2019ll see us ramping those and launching those. So we\u2019re fully on track for that. And we feel like we\u2019re over all of the issues that we\u2019ve had in bringing that product to the marketplace. So we feel very comfortable with that. We\u2019re then working very closely. Emerald goes into the Sapphire platform, so we\u2019re working very closely with our customers and the timing there, the product is looking very healthy, so we\u2019re nicely on track. So that will be a 2023 product and then Granite and Sierra Forest is the 24 product. And just to remind everybody, this is a major new platform. We believe this is a major step forward as we go into Granite Rapids, but also is our first E-core product with Sierra Forest, right. And this we believe is really sort of this ability to have a fleet offering where a lot of cloud workloads just say, give a great container and let me run that quite firmly, efficient TCO efficiently. And that\u2019s what Sierra Forest will do. And then Granite Rapids clearly the performance leader in the marketplace. So both of those will be 24 products. And again, right, we\u2019re powering on that this next quarter. So we\u2019re looking very healthy. Or this quarter, I should say, in Q3. So looking very good so far. So we\u2019ll just say the roadmap is healthy, looking on track and our execution here must improve. Many of these products were well underway when we showed up. As we said, the culture right of execution needs to be rebuilt. And we are working heavily to rebuild the culture of this team. And in fact we just completed our employee engagement survey. And this was the most significant year-on-year improvements in history. Many of our employee engagement survey results now are now best in industry. We\u2019ve totally reversed the brain drain that we had, so teams are excited. The momentum is building. And many of these products, hey, we\u2019re launching the new products with the revising, hear us talk more about our TikTok execution discipline going forward. But a lot of these products were underway. So they weren\u2019t launched with the new execution and methodology discipline. So we\u2019re working through those. And as each one of these gets better, our execution and confidence in those deliveries is improving, culture is improving, we\u2019re making great progress. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Dave if you can clarify why you are taking the Sapphire, I guess, charges, is it just the pre-production reserve or is there something else going on? And my question is based on your comments about the recovery profile for DCG in, I guess, DCAI in the second half, it seems like PC market is \u2013 at least your expectation is that the PC market will recover quicker than DCAI. I\u2019m a little bit surprised by that because you have Sapphire ramping and I don\u2019t know if the inventory situation was worse in DC versus in PC. So I\u2019m just surprised by the fact that you are saying that PC will record faster than DCAI. If you can clarify that, that\u2019ll be helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zinsner: Okay. So yes, you\u2019re right, Sapphire Rapids, we reserve the production inventory before it has gone what we call PRQ. So it\u2019s the quality metric. And so we reserve all the product and since the main, as path of the main SKUs have not at this point reached PRQ, we continue to reserve them once they do, which we expect later this year then we stop first of all, reserving the production inventory. And then likelihood is some of this will also sell. And so, we\u2019ll be able to recover some portion of that reserve likely as we progress through the end of this year and next year. On CCG and DCAI, I think, the inventory correction in CCG was definitely more pronounced. And so you get this, the benefit of the shipping back to the consumption level is more pronounced when things recover. That\u2019s number one. We also will see more pricing improvement in CCGs and DCAI both, we are adjusting pricing, but the pricing is more significant in CCG. And so, that also gives CCG a lift in the later part of the year.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you.\nDave Zinsner: Next question.\nOperator: We have a question from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the capital spending cuts. Can you give us a sense for, does that affect shells versus wait for fab equipment? And is there sort of any opportunity cost to that? And then to the extent that \u2013 does that change to your comments about the overall trajectory over the next few years? Do you still expect CapEx to be rising from here?\nDave Zinsner: Yes, good question. So important thing is that when you look at gross CapEx, it\u2019s about 25% of the reduction, about 75% of the reduction is actually increased capital offset. So it\u2019s not a significant adjustment to the gross number. It\u2019s almost entirely on the equipment side reduction and some of it is just timing of receipts of equipment. And sorry, Joe, what was the other part of your question?\nJoseph Moore: Just the trajectory. I know you had talked about capital spending generally rising from here, but you also talked about guardrails, can you just talk about the trade-offs of your business being slower versus not looking for forecast, but how you\u2019re thinking about the long-term spending program?\nDave Zinsner: So we intend to manage to the guardrails for sure. What I think has become really positive for us is the capital offsets. Maybe I\u2019ll talk a little bit about it and you could go into details about chips if you want Pat. We just are in general, way more optimistic about what we\u2019re going to get in terms of capital offsets. In fact, I think, our forecast for the year is 4x, what it was when we talked about it at Investor Day. And so, clearly for this year we\u2019re going to see strong offsets. And I think given what happened today, I think, we\u2019re going to have good offsets in the coming years as well. So I think that will really help us kind of keep the guardrails intact. I mean, obviously on a long-term basis we\u2019re always looking at our CapEx in relationship to demand. We\u2019re building supply to meet demand and modulating that as the signals change on the demand front. At this point, I think, given the long lead times of building out these factories, we\u2019re very confident that the growth rates of our markets are going to be quite healthy. And we\u2019re going to need the supply to come online. May we modulate are make tiny adjustments to it over the course of years. Yes, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be a significant magnitude, but we \u2013 but still at the end of the day, we feel very good about the guardrails we talked about. It\u2019s going to be more like mid-30s, net CapEx intensity in our investment phase that that goes through 2024. And then in 2025, 2026, we\u2019ll see a step down as we start to get the benefits of that in terms of revenue growth and margin growth and we\u2019ll normalize more into the mid-20s.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And as Dave is alluding to the passage today by the house of the CHIPS Act following the Senate Passage on Tuesday, this is historic legislation. Literally since World War II, there might not have been a more important piece of industrial policy that\u2019s came forward through Congress. So we are thrilled by that. And then also something that we pointed to, and we\u2019ve been very active and I\u2019ve been very active. This is great for the semiconductor industry. This is beneficial to Intel. This was one of the pieces of the smart capital program as we described back an Investor Day. And now seeing this come across the line will clearly be part of that ability for us to invest aggressively in the strategy that we described to you. We see this as an accelerant to our strategy and something that will give us the capacity to both meet our product needs as well as our Foundry customer needs as well. This is powerful and something that we are thrilled to have come across the line just today. We look forward to this being on the President\u2019s desk in the next couple of days and signed into law. This was a historic moment for the semiconductor industry. And I hope everybody on the line just realizes how significant the passage of this was for semiconductors, for technology, for long-term research, this was huge. We were thrilled to be a part of it.\nJohn Pitzer: Next question, please operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask questions. So Pat, you let us your prepared remarks discussing the macro environment, but you also called out Intel specific execution issues and specifically product design. Were you just referring to Sapphire Rapids or was this a general statement across several of your product segments, including client and graphics? And can you just articulate like what some of these product design issues are? Are they architectural issues, performance issues, design closure, changing custom requirements? Any help there would be great. Obviously, as you mentioned, many of these programs were already underway when you joined the team, but what is it specifically that you\u2019re doing now to ensure better design execution going forward?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Harlan. And if I would just to step back slightly, right, I view the recovery, rebuilding in three different chapters. One was TD and manufacturing\u2026\nHarlan Sur: Yes.\nPat Gelsinger: \u2026best transistors capacity. Second design and products. We have to deliver the products that we say to our customers. And if they ask for it Monday at noon, Monday at 11:59, it is there right in the volumes you say, at the performance levels, power levels, et cetera. And the third chapter is building growth, right. And establishing the new products, the new product lines for growth and obviously, we\u2019ve laid the foundations for all three. As TD and manufacturing are now making good progress. The focus really is get the product and design execution superb again, right. And I point back to that sort of tick\u2013tock discipline that we had in the past, that was a key part of what we\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s exactly what we have underway, rebuilding that kind of product disciplined execution. Clearly the Sapphire Rapids miss that we had, we\u2019re raising the quality bars for that. We weren\u2019t shipping at the quality levels, the security levels that we needed to in the past going clearly we shouldn\u2019t have had that bug in the product in the first place. So that caused another stepping for the volume release. Our software release on our discrete graphics, right, was clearly underperforming. We thought that we would be able to leverage the integrated graphics software stack. And it was wholly inadequate for the performance levels, gaming compatibility, et cetera, that we needed. So we\u2019re not hitting our 4 million unit goal in the discrete graphics space, even as we\u2019re now catching up and getting better software releases. We also \u2013 I\u2019ll say the timelines for our products as we\u2019ve committed them to customers, hey, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re competitive with the best-in-class in the industry. Our design timelines, we have to get them better. And we\u2019re focused on doing that. And that\u2019s for some of the longer roadmap term items where we have to be best-in-class in our design cycles, design costs, power envelopes, architectural leadership, things that you would expect from Intel in the past, and we\u2019re rebuilding those muscles for the future. So those would be the two examples we point to specifically that we\u2019re visible this quarter, but we just don\u2019t have a lot more work to do. And as I said, it takes these are three, four-year long projects. These were many of them were underway. We\u2019re putting in place these disciplines now. And the products that are being launched with this entirely new methodology and alignment, well, they don\u2019t come out for a couple more years. So we\u2019re still working through that inventory of designs that were in process, a lot of work to do, a lot of rebuilding and that\u2019s where a lot of my attention is being focused on. And maybe now that I spend a little bit less time in Washington, right, this is the focus for us as a team is getting that execution to be superb once again.\nHarlan Sur: Thank you.\nJohn Pitzer: Next question, please operator.\nOperator: We have a question from Randy Abrams with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRandy Abrams: Yes. Thank you. A multi-part question. If you could talk in IFS similar on the MediaTek announcement, the products scope, and potentially expand that to advanced products or reference design cooperation. Also want to task a bit more of the CHIPS Act, how it changes your approach to the business. And for David, if the capital offsets assume some of the U.S. benefits and how it could impact the tax rate?\nPat Gelsinger: Good. On IFS, clearly, MediaTek, they\u2019re the largest fabulous supplier from Taiwan made, they\u2019re seeking to have a broadening of their supply chain. And as we\u2019ve said, our strategy is provide a pathway for customers to have a globally balanced resilient supply chain. As I also mentioned in the formal comments six of 10 of the largest Foundry customers in the world, we now have active engagement. So the pipeline of customers grew. We added another billion to the pipeline this quarter. MediaTek was an Intel 16 announcement, one of the more mature offerings in the portfolio, which makes sense, right. Intel 3, Intel 18a, these are yet to be, I\u2019ll say designable products and we have test chips underway, but we\u2019re not yet to the point that the PDKs or the design libraries would be adequate for people to make design commitments quite at this point in time. But overall, great progress on IFS. We\u2019re thrilled with the MediaTek announcement and a robust pipeline of customers continues to build because this idea of a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain, Intel giving the best transistors and capacity corridors. And I\u2019d also say that our IFS strategy pivots on this idea of system foundry. The world is moving where the \u2013 we\u2019re moving from a board to a system and package. And a system and package needs advanced 2.5 and 3D package, an area of Intel\u2019s leadership, interconnect standards. We\u2019ve announced the standardization of UCIe. We\u2019re leading that, software assets, another area of advantage for us and will engage with and deliver this across portfolio process technologies ours and others. This idea of system foundry is gaining clear interest to our customers as well. With respect to chips and capital, we\u2019ll say, we were driving this for the last year and a half and we\u2019re fully expecting this to be the case in time, we\u2019re thrilled to get it done. That said, we also initiated such an effort with Europe. And that\u2019s making great progress as well. And as Dave said, we\u2019re also looking to other capital partners as well, which we hope to be able to talk about more in the future with you as well.\nDave Zinsner: And then just on your question, we have not assumed any CHIPS Act money in 2022. Our expectation is there\u2019ll be a process and that process will take us into 2023 before we start receiving money from CHIPS. So not assumed in 2022, although, we\u2019re assuming that we will see some in 2023. As you point out, the CHIPS Act or the bill that was passed is a combination of grant money and in tax credits, I think it\u2019s a little early to determine exactly how all that is administered and makes its way into the \u2013 our P&L. So we\u2019ll table that until that becomes clearer to us exactly how things shake out and we\u2019ll give you more color once we have a better assessment of that.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Randy. Can we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m a little confused. You said that Sapphire Rapids was on time and it\u2019s ramping in volume in the second half, but you also said data center growth in the second half was going to be pretty muted off of a base that\u2019s really low. And then you also said that data center pricing improvements in the second half would be less than what you\u2019re seeing in clients. So doesn\u2019t really sound likes Sapphire Rapids ramp is helping at all. What is going on with that? Like, how should I be thinking about the impact of that Sapphire Rapids ramp? Is that ramps into volume? Or is it the question is like most of the volume coming into 2023 or why isn\u2019t it having more of an impact in the second half. Is it ramps?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. We said in the prepared remarks that it\u2019s later than we were expecting Sapphire Rapids, it\u2019s ramping later. We have some SKUs out, which is good, but the main SKUs are not out. And they happen later in the year. And of course, they\u2019ll contribute way more significantly to next year than they\u2019re going to contribute to this year. We do see an opportunity in the client space, given our Alder Lake position for pricing increases that are really passing on inflation. And we know customers understand that obviously our competitive position is not as strong in the DCI business. And so there are opportunities to adjust pricing, but not across the board, so that is impacting us a bit.\nStacy Rasgon: But you\u2019re basically saying that\u2019s Sapphire Rapids is effectively a first half 2023 volume ramp. That seems to be what you\u2019re saying. Yes.\nPat Gelsinger: I think there\u2019s some ramps this year and then mostly at ramps next year. Yes.\nDave Zinsner: Yes. Like I said, we started shipping some of the SKUs earlier in the year, right. Those weren\u2019t some of the higher volume SKUs, the volume ramp SKUs were pushed out, right, as we said Stacy. And they will start ramping late in the year, but the bigger financial impact definitely is next year. Sapphire Rapids, right, is still the leadership product. We continue to get great reviews from our customers on the product areas like AI performance, that we\u2019re competing with low the mid-tier of NVIDIA dedicated AI processors, the security capabilities as part of it, unquestioned the accelerators and unquestioned leadership. We\u2019re also getting more and more momentum from our software optimizations that come with it as well. So all of those taken together, a lot of enthusiasm, every cloud vendor, every data center vendor et cetera is enthusiastic for this product. And we\u2019re now, as I say, in the final days of getting it completed and beginning those customer volume ramps. And obviously financially, we\u2019ll start to see some of those inventory reserves reversing as well, but yes, this was not our finest hour in execution. We\u2019re rebuilding our execution machine and this product, a lot of enthusiasm forward in the marketplace as we deliver it.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Stacy. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: We have a question from William Stein with Truist. Your line is open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It relates to that last topic of the timeliness of delivery of new products. So while Sapphire Rapids is delayed, sounds like something on the order half the year. Pat, in the press release, it noted that the later nodes are still on track or ahead of track, I think was the language. As outsiders, what can we look to sort of judge and determine whether Intel is continuing to be on pace as we progress through the quarters, aside from just the sort of summary statements and the press release. Is there some other metric you could disclose of there some way we can better understand whether Intel is getting back on track and keeping these commitments to deliver these products as you\u2019ve scheduled it. Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Maybe as we just run through the five nodes quickly Intel 7 done, volume shipments, we said five nodes, four years, Intel 7, 35 million units, you can go rip one apart. I\u2019m sure our competitors have done, tear downs on it done. Intel 4, right, we\u2019ve said is, hey, Meteor Lake looking good. At this point, it\u2019s now broadly sampled to customers. So it\u2019s looking very healthy as well. Also, we had the independent analysis of our detailed updates that we gave at the VLSI conference recently. And if you go look at some of the reports from that, people were pleasantly surprised. They said, oh, Intel 4, it looks as good as some of the three nanometer competitors. So this is looking pretty good. So certainly we\u2019ll be giving more of those technical updates going forward on the real performance. Also, we\u2019ve given updates on Granite Rapids, one of the lead vehicles of Intel 3. We also have said that, we\u2019ll give you updates on 20a and 18a test chip updates and others. We\u2019ll also have independent assessments of those as we announce foundry customers, right, which will be another point to validation that you\u2019ll see. So we\u2019re going to keep giving you more and more points of validation as we go along for, trust me, these are analyzed, the performance of each one of these process nodes, the defect density of each of these process nodes, the maturity of the design collateral, the residents from the foundry customers for each one, it\u2019s being scrutinized extraordinarily well. And with that, I think you\u2019ll get more and more confidence that what we\u2019re saying is not only verified by us, but independently by industry sources as well. So with that, let me just wrap up our time. First, I\u2019d like to say, thank you. We\u2019re grateful for you joining us today, opportunity that you\u2019ve given us to update you on our business. We summarized three key messages as we finish. We\u2019re not satisfied with the quarter and the financial results that we gave you today. We have growing confidence in the strategy and we are optimistic finally about the future. We deserve some tough questions this quarter, but also appreciate that they\u2019re fair and relevant to the business. Transformations are not easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is. And despite the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing, we demonstrated substantial progress in IFS, NEX business records, PSG record in that business, the chips passage today huge, clear customer wins like AWS and Meta and NVIDIA. And for the last question, great progress on our TD milestones and our manufacturing milestones. With that, we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. While we continue to make solid progress on our strategy, Q2 results were disappointing, below the standards we have set for the company and below the commitments we have made to you, our shareholders. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver of the shortfall, but Q2 also reflected our own execution issues in areas like product design, DCAI, and the ramp of AXG offerings. We have an obligation to remain vigilant and to respond to the changing business conditions while not losing sight of our long-term goals and opportunities. We will look to do both by adjusting and refocusing our spending levels in the near term, at the same time, as we accelerate the deployment of our smart capital strategy and improve product execution. Collectively, these actions will begin to show dividends in the second half of the year, allowing us to return gross margins to our target range by Q4 and maintain our initial free cash flow outlook for 2022. While still early in our journey, we remain laser-focused on executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. The current economic backdrop only strengthens our result and we are embracing this environment to accelerate our transformation. For example, regaining our leadership begins with Moore's Law and the capacity to deliver it at scale. Over the last 18 months, we've taken the right steps to establish a strong footing for our TD roadmap. We are well into the ramp of Intel 7 now shipping in excess of 35 million units. Intel 4 is ready for volume production in second half of this year and Intel 3, 20A and 18A are all at or ahead of schedule. We've received additional strong third-party validation for TD, IFS and our manufacturing group just this week when we announced MediaTek as our next major foundry customer, a great example of our One Intel culture. I want to congratulate our teams on what we expect to be many announcements as we execute to become an, at scale, leading edge, geographically diversified systems foundry. But we must also be clear-eyed as we look into the second half. We are planning for volatility as the world adjusts to the end of a two-plus-year pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus governments used to fight it. Across the economy, supply chain issues have both limited the ability to meet demand in some areas and driven inventory well above normal levels in others. We are prepared to manage through a slowdown typical of the normal cycles the semiconductor industry has experienced over the last 50 years. While the depth and duration are still difficult to predict, we have a proven track record of being able to adjust and succeed in any environment. Let me address some of the specific actions we are taking. First, we further sharpened our focus in Q2 selling our drone business and making the difficult decision to wind down our efforts in Optane, as we embrace CXL, a standard which Intel Corporation pioneered. These add to actions last year in NAND and the sale of McAfee. In total, we have now exited six businesses since my return providing roughly $1.5 billion for investments aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy. We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022, and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year, which Dave will address later. Importantly, expense discipline is not impacting the strategy and we remain firmly on track to achieve process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership in 2025. This goal is our true North Star. Second, our ability to invest aggressively and fulfill our commitment to a strong and growing dividend is anchored by the progress we are making in deploying our smart capital strategy. We are thrilled to see the bipartisan vote in the Congress this week and expect CHIPS Act to be on the President's best shortly. We have been integrally involved in moving this groundbreaking legislation forward. This progress, combined with the strong momentum in Europe, will reshape our industry and bring us toward a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain that we are uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from. Access to mission aligned pools of capital supports the accelerated pursuit of our strategy and will enable our torrid pace. Third, I rejoined Intel to re-energize and re-establish a culture of execution and innovation. With process technology and capacity expansion, both now trending very well, we have the critical foundation we need for improved product execution. We have rebuilt our leadership team now fully assembled for the first time. And together, we have reestablished OKRs throughout the organization to drive common purpose and importantly, a system of accountability. In the coming months, we will begin to share more with the investment community on the next evolution of our TikTok model to drive consistent and predictable cadence of process and design innovation. As we look beyond the near-term, the semiconductor industry continues to be at the beginning of a new structural growth phase, driven by four superpowers: one, ubiquitous compute; two, pervasive connectivity; three, cloud-to-edge infrastructure; and four, AI. Combined, these drivers support a semiconductor industry eclipsing $1 trillion by 2030. What remains very clear even during this period of uncertainty is the growing importance of Silicon to the global economy and to each of our daily lives. However, as a result of macro weaknesses, we now expect the PC TAM to decline roughly 10% in calendar year 2022, characterized by broadening consumer weakness and relative strength in enterprise and higher end skews. Importantly, our Q2 PC unit volume suggest we are shipping below consumption as some of our largest customers are reducing inventory levels at a rate not seen in the last decade. And along with some pricing actions should allow for sequential growth into the second half even as some customers manage inventory lower. While COVID-related dynamics like work-from-home and school-from-home pulled forward some demand, they also solidified the PC as an essential tool in the post-pandemic world. For example, PC and corporate usage remains historically high even as the pandemic's most acute impacts diminish. Markedly higher per PC usage and a larger installed base, including 600 million PCs that are four years and older, supports a PC TAM sustainably above 300 million units. Data center trends are still well entrenched. Data has been growing exponentially at a 50% CAGR for over 20 years, but until recently it has been uneconomical to turn that data into true actionable insights. With the advent of AI, along with CPUs, GPUs and accelerators, we now have the tools to access and use more of the data we create, driving significantly higher compute demand and a multi-year CAGR in the data center TAM of at least mid-teens. Despite these drivers, demand will not be immune from economic headwinds. In addition to match-set issues, which have constrained shipments for multiple quarters, increasing economic concerns are leading to a reduction in second-half demand. As a result, we have lowered our server TAM assumptions to reflect more modest growth in 2022. Against this backdrop, let me highlight key developments in our businesses: In response to supply chain and match-set issues, we closely collaborated with our customers and suppliers to effectively address their most critical needs. We rapidly adjusted to changing market conditions, made cost reductions and leveraged smart capital to execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy. Despite significantly lower revenue impacting overall gross margins, Q2 saw continued strong performance in our factory network, and we exceeded our wafer cost goals with 10 nm unit costs declining approximately 8% year-on-year. In TD, we continue to deliver on the promise of Moore's Law, and our ambitions to deliver 1 trillion transistors in a device by 2030. Intel 4 details were released at the recent VLSI conference to positive reviews, and we've now taped in the first stepping of the Granite Rapids CPU and expect power-on this quarter. In the second half of this year, we plan to tape in numerous internal and Foundry customer test chips on various process nodes including Intel 3 and Intel 18A. In our client business, Alder Lake momentum continues. We have the strongest PC lineup in 5-plus years, and we remain unapologetic about our growing leadership and share position. We are building on Alder Lake leadership with Raptor Lake in second half of this year and Meteor Lake in 2023 exemplifying how our innovative design decisions can drive leadership performance even before re-establishing best-in-class transistor technology. In Q2, we launched the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors, the final products in our Alder Lake family. The Alder Lake family is now powering more than 525 designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and others. To date, we've shipped well in excess of 35 million units of Alder Lake. Within the current market, we are also seeing relative strength in the premium segments we serve across consumer and commercial. We expect to build on this momentum with the launch of our next-gen product family Raptor Lake starting with our desktop SKUs this fall, followed by our mobile family by end of year. The Raptor Lake family will offer customers significant advantages, including double-digit performance gains gen-on-gen and socket compatibility with Alder Lake. And in 2023, we will deliver our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4 Meteor Lake, which is showing good health in both our and our customers' labs. Turning to DCAI, as we stated at Investor Day, over the next couple of years as we rebuild our server product portfolio, we expect to grow slower than the overall data center market. It's not a fact we like, but the forecast we see. We have a singular focus to regain performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud. The advantage of our incumbency position remains underappreciated and provides significant opportunity to drive outsized advantages to our customers. For example, we expanded our supply agreement with Meta, leveraging our IDM advantage to ensure Meta can meet its expanding compute needs. Also in Q2, we agreed to expand our partnership with AWS to include the co-development of multi-generational data center solutions optimized for AWS infrastructure and Intel as a strategic customer for internal workloads including EDA. We expect these custom Xeon solutions will bring greater levels of differentiation and a durable TCO advantage to AWS and their customers, including Intel. In addition, NVIDIA announced the selection of Sapphire Rapids for use in their new DGX-H100, which will couple Sapphire Rapids with NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs to deliver unprecedented AI performance. Beyond Xeon-based CPUs, we launched our next-generation Gaudi 2 AI accelerator in the quarter with a whopping 4x improvement generation-to-generation, and in the most recent MLPerf training benchmark test, Gaudi 2 has a substantial lead in Resnet-50 and BERT benchmarks. In the second quarter, we also began delivering on our software strategy with the acquisition of Granulate, expanding our platform capabilities with real time AI-driven continuous optimizations for cloud computing and the initial release of Amber, our security attestation service. Since we acquired Granulate, their customer pipeline has doubled and their revenue pipeline has tripled. Finally, programmable solutions achieved record 2Q revenue and was just shy of an all-time record revenue quarter driven by strong demand, including the ramp of the flagship Agilex FPGA family and improving supply. In NEX, we had an outstanding Q2. We achieved record revenue and PRQ'd Mount Evans, an IPU we co-developed and are now beginning to ramp with a large hyperscale partner with additional customers in 2023. In addition, our latest Xeon D processors, built specifically for software defined infrastructure across the network and edge, launched at this year's Mobile World Congress, and is ramping with leading companies including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. Across the network edge, we're continuing to see interest to deploy more compute and AI capabilities. For example, Ferrovial, a multi-national Spanish infrastructure company is using our edge computing, AI and connectivity technologies to deploy roadside solutions that can identify wrong-way drivers, warn of oncoming hazards and more. In Singapore, Singtel has deployed a network solution with Xeon, Smart Edge and OpenVINO to improve user experiences for use cases like entertainment, industrial, smart manufacturing, smart transportation and smart city. Lastly, ABB is helping utility providers modernize their electric grid and create a more sustainable energy market by adopting standardized rugged servers based on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon. NEX continues to clearly benefit from networks that are increasingly moving toward software and AI that is increasingly moving to the edge, and we expect another revenue record in Q3. For AXG, while we will not hit our GPU unit target, we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. In Q2, we started to ramp Intel Arc graphics for laptops and OEMs, including Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, HP and Asus. COVID-related supply chain issues and our own software-readiness challenges caused availability delays that we continue to work to overcome. Intel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will start to ship in Q3. Our energy-efficient blockchain accelerator Blockscale achieved a major milestone in Q2 with revenue shipments to our lead customers, going from tape-in to shipping in less than a year. We expect to ship millions of units this year, not originally in our forecast. Our data center GPU code-named Arctic Sound-M has started production and is now shipping to customers supporting a diverse range of workloads, starting with media streaming and cloud gaming, followed by support for AI visual inference and virtual desktops. In high-performance computing, we highlighted the installation of the Argonne National Lab Aurora supercomputer at our Intel Vision event in May, and we are on track to deliver over 10,000 blades in 2022, enabling over two exaflops of peak performance. We also announced new partnerships including with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center to set up a pioneering RISC-V zettascale lab, and our continued collaboration with the University of Cambridge to evolve their current lab from exascale to zettascale. Our IFS momentum continues. Creating a geographically balanced, secure and resilient semiconductor supply chain as well as access to our transistor technology is driving strong customer interest in our foundry business. In addition to the MediaTek agreement that we announced earlier this week, we now have active engagements with six of the top 10 fabless customers across our offerings, including 18A. Overall, we are engaged with 30 customers for test chips, and now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $6 billion. Augmenting our organic activity is our proposed acquisition of Tower Semiconductor. We now have regulatory approval or clearance in four geographies, including the U.S., and we still expect the acquisition to close by early next year. In Q2, we also launched the IFS Cloud Alliance a partnership with leading cloud providers including Microsoft Azure and AWS and EDA tool providers, including Ansys, Cadence, Siemens EDA and Synopsys. The IFS Cloud Alliance is the next phase of our accelerator ecosystem program that will enable secure design environments in the cloud, improving foundry customer design efficiency and accelerating time-to-market. Lastly, in Mobileye, we achieved another record quarter in revenue in Q2 and we continue to be poised to unlock further value with our proposed IPO later this year, pending market conditions. Mobileye's backlog continues to grow, with first-half 2022 design wins generating 37 million units of projected future business, compared to 16 million units actually shipped in the first half. As a result of Mobileye's high-definition map product, called REM, we are currently crowd-sourcing 43 million miles per day on average from approximately 1.5 million vehicles. This data is automatically built into a map, which currently covers greater than 90% of all roads in both Europe and U.S. which will support systems across the entire driving assist to autonomous vehicle spectrum. Looking ahead, before turning it over to Dave, I want to close with a few thoughts. First, after a very successful Intel Vision event in Q2, I am looking forward to hosting Intel Innovation on September 27 and 28, our core technical conference for global developers, architects and engineering leaders. I hope to see many of you joining me there. Second, as I said when we began our journey, Intel will be a source of innovation driving new businesses and additional TAM in large and growing markets. Taken together, we have already announced over 10 new revenue producing product lines so far this year, which are just beginning to ramp, and we expect to announce more in second half and calendar year 2023. The foundations for our growth story are taking shape. I know I speak for all of our employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead. Thanks, C.J. So when you look at the fourth quarter, first of all we are at this point given the inventory burns in both CCG and DCAI shipping at below the rate of consumption for those markets. And so there is a natural recovery that occurs that we would expect as we progress through the rest of the year once inventory is in a good place. So we do feel we're at the bottom here in terms of revenue in the Q2, Q3 time frame and Q4 would recover just based on that alone. I'd say the other thing is we've got a good set of products coming out over the course the second half of the year. And I think that we're kind of operating with winded our sales in terms of product offerings in all of our businesses. And then third, we are increasing pricing. The pricing generally takes effect in the fourth quarter. We've gone a fair amount of time. The advantage of the IDM strategy is we can absorb a lot of inflationary impacts that others can't. And so we were able to kind of go a bit longer in terms of the price increases, but at this point now that some of those pricing increase or inflationary increases have turned out to be more permanent where there's a certain amount of asset we do need to pass-on to the customers and they're comfortable to do that. And so that also is a factor. And then lastly, I would just say the fourth quarter is generally just a seasonally strong quarter for us and particularly in the PC space. So I think all those factors give us really good confidence that Q2, Q3 represent the bottom for revenue and that fourth quarter we'll see some strength. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think that officially is actually two questions, but anyway, I'll \u2013 we'll take them both. On the market side, we'll say we were well into the quarter and we saw the market characteristics change quite suddenly, right, and that resulted in both the sell-through and the marketplace, but also these significant inventory adjustments. We worked with our customers on those inventory adjustments. And as we said, these are like once in 10-year kind of inventory adjustments, because the customers were working through the quarter, catching up to demand that was short for years, right? And all of a sudden as we saw that shifting, they took quite significant adjustments to their inventory positions. And we wanted to be in a position that we had some thoughtful view of what the market was for the future. So that's the reason that brought us to today. We think that we've given you a clear view of where the market is coming into the future. The DCAI point, as I said in my formal comments, we were disappointed. Some of that was driven by the macro; it was also match set issues that we've been struggling with as well. And Ethernet components, power supply components, et cetera have been challenged. But as we also said, we had some of our own unique execution issues and we kept the quality bar high on Sapphire Rapids and thus we did another stepping, which was a forecast, which put some inventory and reserve issues in front of us as opposed to high ASP new product revenue. So some of those things were unique issues to us that we were addressing. That said, we do feel like the progress in the data center, right, is clear in front of us. We have \u2013 Emerald is looking very good. We'll be powering on Sapphire or Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids shortly. All of that taken together, we feel our competitive position is improving. We also see that we know where the market share is and wins like we announced with AWS and Meta, we are going to focus on every socket, every workload, every customer quite aggressively on both AWS and Meta. These were substantial wins for us this quarter and we're hoped to be announcing several others like that as we go forward. We're also bringing new capabilities as we sort of said in our formal comments. The size of our footprint here is underappreciated, and we're going to be focusing on really benefiting from that and bringing new capabilities against that enormous footprint with capabilities like Granulate and our Amber security service, things that allow us to bring more value to our customers as well as harvest more revenue from that enormous installed base. So all of that taken together, we feel like we are owning up to the challenges that we had in data center, but have a clear view of how we write this business for the future and are well underway and doing exactly that. Yes. And giving a bit more detail on Sapphire, we're already ramping a number of SKUs of Sapphire rapids already. They began ramping last quarter. So, we have a number of those ramping. The particular issue that we highlighted, wasn't affecting those SKUs, so those continue to ramp. So we did another tape out, which I'll say for the larger volume skews, and those will be volume shipping in the second half of the year. So you'll see us ramping those and launching those. So we're fully on track for that. And we feel like we're over all of the issues that we've had in bringing that product to the marketplace. So we feel very comfortable with that. We're then working very closely. Emerald goes into the Sapphire platform, so we're working very closely with our customers and the timing there, the product is looking very healthy, so we're nicely on track. So that will be a 2023 product and then Granite and Sierra Forest is the 24 product. And just to remind everybody, this is a major new platform. We believe this is a major step forward as we go into Granite Rapids, but also is our first E-core product with Sierra Forest, right. And this we believe is really sort of this ability to have a fleet offering where a lot of cloud workloads just say, give a great container and let me run that quite firmly, efficient TCO efficiently. And that's what Sierra Forest will do. And then Granite Rapids clearly the performance leader in the marketplace. So both of those will be 24 products. And again, right, we're powering on that this next quarter. So we're looking very healthy. Or this quarter, I should say, in Q3. So looking very good so far. So we'll just say the roadmap is healthy, looking on track and our execution here must improve. Many of these products were well underway when we showed up. As we said, the culture right of execution needs to be rebuilt. And we are working heavily to rebuild the culture of this team. And in fact we just completed our employee engagement survey. And this was the most significant year-on-year improvements in history. Many of our employee engagement survey results now are now best in industry. We've totally reversed the brain drain that we had, so teams are excited. The momentum is building. And many of these products, hey, we're launching the new products with the revising, hear us talk more about our TikTok execution discipline going forward. But a lot of these products were underway. So they weren't launched with the new execution and methodology discipline. So we're working through those. And as each one of these gets better, our execution and confidence in those deliveries is improving, culture is improving, we're making great progress. Thank you. Next question. Yes. And as Dave is alluding to the passage today by the house of the CHIPS Act following the Senate Passage on Tuesday, this is historic legislation. Literally since World War II, there might not have been a more important piece of industrial policy that's came forward through Congress. So we are thrilled by that. And then also something that we pointed to, and we've been very active and I've been very active. This is great for the semiconductor industry. This is beneficial to Intel. This was one of the pieces of the smart capital program as we described back an Investor Day. And now seeing this come across the line will clearly be part of that ability for us to invest aggressively in the strategy that we described to you. We see this as an accelerant to our strategy and something that will give us the capacity to both meet our product needs as well as our Foundry customer needs as well. This is powerful and something that we are thrilled to have come across the line just today. We look forward to this being on the President's desk in the next couple of days and signed into law. This was a historic moment for the semiconductor industry. And I hope everybody on the line just realizes how significant the passage of this was for semiconductors, for technology, for long-term research, this was huge. We were thrilled to be a part of it. Yes. Thank you, Harlan. And if I would just to step back slightly, right, I view the recovery, rebuilding in three different chapters. One was TD and manufacturing... ...best transistors capacity. Second design and products. We have to deliver the products that we say to our customers. And if they ask for it Monday at noon, Monday at 11:59, it is there right in the volumes you say, at the performance levels, power levels, et cetera. And the third chapter is building growth, right. And establishing the new products, the new product lines for growth and obviously, we've laid the foundations for all three. As TD and manufacturing are now making good progress. The focus really is get the product and design execution superb again, right. And I point back to that sort of tick\u2013tock discipline that we had in the past, that was a key part of what we're doing, and that's exactly what we have underway, rebuilding that kind of product disciplined execution. Clearly the Sapphire Rapids miss that we had, we're raising the quality bars for that. We weren't shipping at the quality levels, the security levels that we needed to in the past going clearly we shouldn't have had that bug in the product in the first place. So that caused another stepping for the volume release. Our software release on our discrete graphics, right, was clearly underperforming. We thought that we would be able to leverage the integrated graphics software stack. And it was wholly inadequate for the performance levels, gaming compatibility, et cetera, that we needed. So we're not hitting our 4 million unit goal in the discrete graphics space, even as we're now catching up and getting better software releases. We also \u2013 I'll say the timelines for our products as we've committed them to customers, hey, we don't think we're competitive with the best-in-class in the industry. Our design timelines, we have to get them better. And we're focused on doing that. And that's for some of the longer roadmap term items where we have to be best-in-class in our design cycles, design costs, power envelopes, architectural leadership, things that you would expect from Intel in the past, and we're rebuilding those muscles for the future. So those would be the two examples we point to specifically that we're visible this quarter, but we just don't have a lot more work to do. And as I said, it takes these are three, four-year long projects. These were many of them were underway. We're putting in place these disciplines now. And the products that are being launched with this entirely new methodology and alignment, well, they don't come out for a couple more years. So we're still working through that inventory of designs that were in process, a lot of work to do, a lot of rebuilding and that's where a lot of my attention is being focused on. And maybe now that I spend a little bit less time in Washington, right, this is the focus for us as a team is getting that execution to be superb once again. Good. On IFS, clearly, MediaTek, they're the largest fabulous supplier from Taiwan made, they're seeking to have a broadening of their supply chain. And as we've said, our strategy is provide a pathway for customers to have a globally balanced resilient supply chain. As I also mentioned in the formal comments six of 10 of the largest Foundry customers in the world, we now have active engagement. So the pipeline of customers grew. We added another billion to the pipeline this quarter. MediaTek was an Intel 16 announcement, one of the more mature offerings in the portfolio, which makes sense, right. Intel 3, Intel 18a, these are yet to be, I'll say designable products and we have test chips underway, but we're not yet to the point that the PDKs or the design libraries would be adequate for people to make design commitments quite at this point in time. But overall, great progress on IFS. We're thrilled with the MediaTek announcement and a robust pipeline of customers continues to build because this idea of a geographically balanced, resilient supply chain, Intel giving the best transistors and capacity corridors. And I'd also say that our IFS strategy pivots on this idea of system foundry. The world is moving where the \u2013 we're moving from a board to a system and package. And a system and package needs advanced 2.5 and 3D package, an area of Intel's leadership, interconnect standards. We've announced the standardization of UCIe. We're leading that, software assets, another area of advantage for us and will engage with and deliver this across portfolio process technologies ours and others. This idea of system foundry is gaining clear interest to our customers as well. With respect to chips and capital, we'll say, we were driving this for the last year and a half and we're fully expecting this to be the case in time, we're thrilled to get it done. That said, we also initiated such an effort with Europe. And that's making great progress as well. And as Dave said, we're also looking to other capital partners as well, which we hope to be able to talk about more in the future with you as well. Yes. We said in the prepared remarks that it's later than we were expecting Sapphire Rapids, it's ramping later. We have some SKUs out, which is good, but the main SKUs are not out. And they happen later in the year. And of course, they'll contribute way more significantly to next year than they're going to contribute to this year. We do see an opportunity in the client space, given our Alder Lake position for pricing increases that are really passing on inflation. And we know customers understand that obviously our competitive position is not as strong in the DCI business. And so there are opportunities to adjust pricing, but not across the board, so that is impacting us a bit. I think there's some ramps this year and then mostly at ramps next year. Yes. Yes. Maybe as we just run through the five nodes quickly Intel 7 done, volume shipments, we said five nodes, four years, Intel 7, 35 million units, you can go rip one apart. I'm sure our competitors have done, tear downs on it done. Intel 4, right, we've said is, hey, Meteor Lake looking good. At this point, it's now broadly sampled to customers. So it's looking very healthy as well. Also, we had the independent analysis of our detailed updates that we gave at the VLSI conference recently. And if you go look at some of the reports from that, people were pleasantly surprised. They said, oh, Intel 4, it looks as good as some of the three nanometer competitors. So this is looking pretty good. So certainly we'll be giving more of those technical updates going forward on the real performance. Also, we've given updates on Granite Rapids, one of the lead vehicles of Intel 3. We also have said that, we'll give you updates on 20a and 18a test chip updates and others. We'll also have independent assessments of those as we announce foundry customers, right, which will be another point to validation that you'll see. So we're going to keep giving you more and more points of validation as we go along for, trust me, these are analyzed, the performance of each one of these process nodes, the defect density of each of these process nodes, the maturity of the design collateral, the residents from the foundry customers for each one, it's being scrutinized extraordinarily well. And with that, I think you'll get more and more confidence that what we're saying is not only verified by us, but independently by industry sources as well. So with that, let me just wrap up our time. First, I'd like to say, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. We summarized three key messages as we finish. We're not satisfied with the quarter and the financial results that we gave you today. We have growing confidence in the strategy and we are optimistic finally about the future. We deserve some tough questions this quarter, but also appreciate that they're fair and relevant to the business. Transformations are not easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is. And despite the headwinds that we're seeing, we demonstrated substantial progress in IFS, NEX business records, PSG record in that business, the chips passage today huge, clear customer wins like AWS and Meta and NVIDIA. And for the last question, great progress on our TD milestones and our manufacturing milestones. With that, we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Dave Zinsner",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat referenced, Q2 was a challenging quarter negatively impacted by multiple factors. First, a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment impacted by inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Second, a much larger than expected OEM inventory correction as our customers adjust to this new macroeconomic environment. Third, worse than expected COVID driven demand reductions and supply dislocations in China and other parts of the supply chain. Due to the difficult macroeconomic environment together with our own execution challenges, our results for the quarter were well below expectations and necessitate a significant revision to our full-year financial guidance. That said, we are taking the actions necessary to maintain our prior full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance, including a slowdown in hiring, CapEx reductions and the expectation for increased capital offsets consistent with our smart capital strategy. We remain fully committed to the business strategy and long-term financial model presented during this year's investor meeting in February. Revenue was $15.3 billion, 15% below our original Q2 guidance as our CCG and DCAI businesses both underperformed our expectations. Note that even in this challenging environment, our NEX and Mobileye businesses achieved all-time record quarterly revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 45%, 600 basis points below guidance on lower revenue and Sapphire Rapids preproduction charges offset by lower manufacturing cost. EPS was $0.29, $0.41 below our guide on lower revenue and gross profit, offset by lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $800 million. CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.4 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments of $27.5 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment grade credit profile. Now turning to our business unit results. CCG revenue was $7.7 billion, below expectations and down 25% year-over-year on global TAM weakness, particularly in the consumer, education and small/medium business markets. The shortfall was also driven by OEM inventory reductions as we worked with our customers to lower their inventory, protect market share and continue to manage through matched set constraints. CPU ASP's were up 11% year-over-year on a richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 73% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10 nanometer and Intel 7 mix, and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform roadmap. DCAI revenue was $4.6 billion, below expectations and down 16% year-over-year on OEM inventory reductions, mix related ASP decline and competitive pressures. Operating profit was $214 million, down 90% year-over-year on lower revenue, higher advanced node startup cost, increased investment in the product roadmap and Sapphire Rapids pre-production charges. NEX achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year on strength and data center networking products, specifically networking Ethernet and 5G. Operating profit was $241 million, down 60% year \u2013 year on mix shift to networking Ethernet and 5G. Increased investment in process technology and lower sell through of reserved inventory. AXG revenue was $186 million, up 5% year-over-year on the ramp of Super Compute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $507 million versus an operating loss of $168 million in Q2 2021 with the increase driven by inventory reserves on Ponte Vecchio and Alchemist products and increased investment to deliver the roadmap of Visual, Super Compute and Custom Accelerated Graphics Products. Mobileye achieved all time record quarterly revenue of $460 million, up 41% year-over-year. Outperforming the rate of increase of global automotive production, which was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating profit was $190 million, up 43% year-over-year on higher revenue partially offset by increased investment in next generation ADAS products. IFS revenue was $122 million, down 54% year-over-year driven by lower mask tool sales as well as revenue decrease in the automotive segment due to customer shortages in the automotive market. Operating loss was $155 million versus as an operating profit of $52 million in Q2 2021, driven by lower revenue and increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. Before we transition to full year and Q3 guidance, after six months on the job let me provide my perspectives on the opportunities I see and focus areas to improve our financial performance and achieve our long-term goals. At the highest level, I see opportunities to improve in two areas. First, ensuring we are allocating our capital to the programs that are clearly aligned to our revised business strategy and generate maximum long-term value to our shareholders. As Pat mentioned, two good examples of continuing to optimize our portfolio are exiting the Optane and drone businesses. We continue to deeply evaluate all opportunities to more narrowly focus our resources on the highest value programs, increasing the probability of success for each of these programs. Second driving structural product cost and operational expense efficiency across the company taking full advantage of our IDM 2.0 strategy. A major focus for me is driving Intel the world class product cost. Key to this is executing our five nodes and four-year strategy, but there are many more aspects to achieving this goal with programs in flight to dramatically reduce product cost. Likewise, there are opportunities in OpEx to ensure we are achieving world class efficiency in everything we do. With my history in the memory business where every penny counts, I know there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar. As part of these focus areas, we expect to see restructuring charges in Q3, and I'll continue to provide regular updates on these efforts. Moving to our full year and Q3 guidance. For the remainder of the year we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to soften with the potential for a recessionary scenario to materialize. There's also risk for continued COVID related impacts on demand and the supply chain to continue throughout the year. As a result of this high level of uncertainty for moving to a range-based approach to revenue guidance for the rest of the year. For full year revenue we are now guiding a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, down from our prior guidance of $76 billion driven by lower expectations for our CCG and DCAI businesses. More specifically in our PC business as Pat discussed, we now see TAM decreasing approximately 10% year-over-year due to the softening macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year due to seasonal strength, OEM inventory returning to balance levels, inflation related price increases to take effect and the ramp of our leadership Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products to position us to compete for share. For DCAI, we expect to see second half revenue growth relative to Q2 levels, but growth will remain muted as competitive and macroeconomic headwinds persist, OEM inventory reductions continue and component constraints impact certain segments. For NEX we expect another record quarter in Q3 and continued growth throughout the year. NEX revenue tailwinds will be fueled by new product introductions, data center and Telco Networking demand and continued improvement in pricing and component supply. For AXG we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. And finally, we expect to see second-half growth in each of our two remaining businesses Mobileye and IFS as they ramp new products and secure new customers. Full year gross margin we're guiding to 49% at the midpoint of revenue guidance with the expectation that gross margin will return to the low end of our target range of 51% to 53% in Q4 as revenue increases, we achieve scale on new product ramps and cost continue to improve. We're forecasting a tax rate of approximately 8% and EPS of $2.30 at the midpoint of the revenue guidance. For net CapEx we're revising down our forecast to $23 billion, $4 billion less than our previous guidance as we moderately adjust our investment and capacity and take advantage of potentially larger than originally forecast capital assets, highlighting significant progress on our smart capital strategy. We expect these actions to offset lower than originally forecast operating cash flow, allowing us to reaffirm adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to negative $2 billion for the year. Finally, we paid dividends of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year and remain committed to growing the dividend over time. Now moving to Q3 guidance; given the aforementioned market environment, we're guiding revenue of $15 billion to $16 billion. At the midpoint of the revenue guidance we're guiding gross margin of 46.5%, a tax rate of 13% and earnings per share of $0.35. In closing the market turbulence and updated outlook are disappointing. However, we believe our turnaround is clearly taking shape and expect Q2 and Q3 to be the financial bottom for the company. We remain completely committed to the strategy and financial model communicated at Investor Day. The long-term financial opportunity of compelling revenue growth and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. And I believe this downturn represents an opportunity to more quickly the transformations necessary to achieve these goals. With that let me turn it back over to John and get your questions. And in fourth quarter, we also see that some of the new business unit areas, right, are started to contribute more significantly as well. On the PC TAM, before we were above the market and with our down revision, we're now exactly in line with the market. We were over 350 million units before, now market ranges are 310 to 325. Our range is consistent with that, C.J. So we don't see ourself ahead of the market like we were before, we were more optimistic. Now we're firmly in line with the market. Clearly, the market has shifted heavily on the consumer side, but the remains strength on the enterprise side, which also gives us confidence. So in addition to the strength of the product roadmap, which Dave said, we also see the enterprise market remaining very healthy and our position and the higher price points and the enterprise, these are good markets for us. And as we're on the back of Alder Lake over 35 million units, Raptor Lake ramping, we're just coming into a great cycle of the overall business. We'd also say that the PC is strong as that work from home, school from home device usage numbers are up significantly for the time that people use their PCs. We also have a strong replacement cycle in front of us. We now have over 600 million PCs that are over four years old. We're definitely seeing that roll through the enterprise markets, again where we have stronger market share and better ASPs. So all that taken together, we think we've ranged it and that's consistent with the financial guidance that we've given you for the rest of the year. And maybe I'll just add in terms of profitability it was disappointing where operating margins landed for the DCAI business for sure. That was largely the impact of the decline in revenue. But keep in mind, we're also investing a lot for all the reasons that Pat said to get to bring out great products that allow our customers and, and so that investment does also weigh down on the operating profitability of the business. We do see that getting better. We took this, Pat mentioned reserves on Sapphire Rapids and those are kind of a one off thing that dissipate as we go through the second half of the year we also expect revenue to improve as we progress through the year. Those things combined should improve operating margins in near term. In the long term, we see this business as a business that gives us greater than corporate average operating margins, gross margins and operating margins for that matter, it has traditionally actually for us and for the industry. And so, it's a matter of just putting our nose down and executing to get those results. And we feel very confident we'll get there. Okay. So yes, you're right, Sapphire Rapids, we reserve the production inventory before it has gone what we call PRQ. So it's the quality metric. And so we reserve all the product and since the main, as path of the main SKUs have not at this point reached PRQ, we continue to reserve them once they do, which we expect later this year then we stop first of all, reserving the production inventory. And then likelihood is some of this will also sell. And so, we'll be able to recover some portion of that reserve likely as we progress through the end of this year and next year. On CCG and DCAI, I think, the inventory correction in CCG was definitely more pronounced. And so you get this, the benefit of the shipping back to the consumption level is more pronounced when things recover. That's number one. We also will see more pricing improvement in CCGs and DCAI both, we are adjusting pricing, but the pricing is more significant in CCG. And so, that also gives CCG a lift in the later part of the year. Next question. Yes, good question. So important thing is that when you look at gross CapEx, it's about 25% of the reduction, about 75% of the reduction is actually increased capital offset. So it's not a significant adjustment to the gross number. It's almost entirely on the equipment side reduction and some of it is just timing of receipts of equipment. And sorry, Joe, what was the other part of your question? So we intend to manage to the guardrails for sure. What I think has become really positive for us is the capital offsets. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about it and you could go into details about chips if you want Pat. We just are in general, way more optimistic about what we're going to get in terms of capital offsets. In fact, I think, our forecast for the year is 4x, what it was when we talked about it at Investor Day. And so, clearly for this year we're going to see strong offsets. And I think given what happened today, I think, we're going to have good offsets in the coming years as well. So I think that will really help us kind of keep the guardrails intact. I mean, obviously on a long-term basis we're always looking at our CapEx in relationship to demand. We're building supply to meet demand and modulating that as the signals change on the demand front. At this point, I think, given the long lead times of building out these factories, we're very confident that the growth rates of our markets are going to be quite healthy. And we're going to need the supply to come online. May we modulate are make tiny adjustments to it over the course of years. Yes, but I wouldn't say it's going to be a significant magnitude, but we \u2013 but still at the end of the day, we feel very good about the guardrails we talked about. It's going to be more like mid-30s, net CapEx intensity in our investment phase that that goes through 2024. And then in 2025, 2026, we'll see a step down as we start to get the benefits of that in terms of revenue growth and margin growth and we'll normalize more into the mid-20s. And then just on your question, we have not assumed any CHIPS Act money in 2022. Our expectation is there'll be a process and that process will take us into 2023 before we start receiving money from CHIPS. So not assumed in 2022, although, we're assuming that we will see some in 2023. As you point out, the CHIPS Act or the bill that was passed is a combination of grant money and in tax credits, I think it's a little early to determine exactly how all that is administered and makes its way into the \u2013 our P&L. So we'll table that until that becomes clearer to us exactly how things shake out and we'll give you more color once we have a better assessment of that. Yes. Like I said, we started shipping some of the SKUs earlier in the year, right. Those weren't some of the higher volume SKUs, the volume ramp SKUs were pushed out, right, as we said Stacy. And they will start ramping late in the year, but the bigger financial impact definitely is next year. Sapphire Rapids, right, is still the leadership product. We continue to get great reviews from our customers on the product areas like AI performance, that we're competing with low the mid-tier of NVIDIA dedicated AI processors, the security capabilities as part of it, unquestioned the accelerators and unquestioned leadership. We're also getting more and more momentum from our software optimizations that come with it as well. So all of those taken together, a lot of enthusiasm, every cloud vendor, every data center vendor et cetera is enthusiastic for this product. And we're now, as I say, in the final days of getting it completed and beginning those customer volume ramps. And obviously financially, we'll start to see some of those inventory reserves reversing as well, but yes, this was not our finest hour in execution. We're rebuilding our execution machine and this product, a lot of enthusiasm forward in the marketplace as we deliver it."

With that, let me hand it over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was another solid quarter where we beat on the top line, exceeded our guidance on gross margin and EPS, and where we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy to unlock a $1 trillion market opportunity. As we laid out at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is built around 4 key pillars. We will deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. In Q1, we made great progress in all of these areas, and we are continuing to hold our full year revenue outlook. In our data center and AI group, we began shipping initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers as planned. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map that strengthens our position in both per core performance and performance per watt for cloud and enterprise workloads. We launched our Arc A Series GPUs for laptops, taking our first steps to give the graphics industry a much needed new addition. Mobileye demonstrated its Level 4 self-driving system in Jerusalem, a major milestone in preparation for its upcoming robotaxi services. We continue to add to our talent with strong industry leaders like Christoph Schell, who recently joined us from HP as our Chief Commercial Officer. And finally, we took another major step in creating a balanced semiconductor supply chain with the announcement of our plans for new investments in Europe. We also held the grand opening of our latest leading-edge factory in Oregon, including a new name for the campus, the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler acres, which recognizes our founder and the site's unique contribution to driving Moore's Law. Q1 also marked a special moment for Intel as we announced our plans to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions, including using 100% renewable energy across our global operations by 2030 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our global operations by 2040. Overall, Q1 was a great start to the year as we continue to execute on the path to our long-term growth story. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are executing at a torrid pace, and I remain confident in our path forward. Before I get into specific updates for each of our business units, let me start with some observations of what we are seeing in the industry. I continue to believe we are just at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across semiconductors. We continue to see some match set limitations in areas like ethernet, some softening in low-end consumer PC and some inventory adjustments, as we discussed on our last call. But overall, the demand signals from customers continue to be robust in areas like enterprise, cloud, AI, graphics and networking. Semiconductors are the fuel of innovation and transformation across a wide range of industries. In the supply chain, lockdowns in Shanghai and the war in Ukraine have demonstrated more than ever that the world needs more resilient and more geographically-balanced semiconductor manufacturing. The chip shortage cost the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability. As an IDM, we believe we are in a good position in the industry to manage through these constraints. In fact, Intel is rising to meet this challenge. Following our announcements in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, we recently announced a series of investments in Europe, spanning our existing operations as well as our new investments in France and Germany, the Silicon Junction. These investments position Intel to meet the future growth and represent a significant step toward our moonshot goal of having half the world\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. and Europe. The pace at which we can reach this goal is dependent on the actions of the U.S. and other governments. America showed leadership when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, but the global situation has grown even more serious since then. The EU has been very aggressive in moving legislation forward to meet this challenge, and I recently testified before the Senate to highlight the critical need for the U.S. to fund the CHIPS Act. I continue to encourage Congress to fund this critical legislation and enable us to move faster towards making a balanced semiconductor supply chain a reality. Turning now to Intel. We continue to make great progress on our plans to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is ramping extremely well with Alder Lake and on Intel 4, Meteor Lake has now successfully booted Windows, Chrome and Linux. The speed at which the team was able to achieve this milestone is a significant sign of the health of both Meteor Lake and our Intel 4 process technology. We plan to deliver several additional milestones in 2022, demonstrating our process technology development remains on track. This includes early Sierra Forest preproduction wafers on Intel 3, IP test wafers on Intel 28 and foundry customer test chips and initial IP shovels on Intel 18a. Simply put, we remain on and in some places, ahead of schedule to deliver 5 nodes in 4 years. Our manufacturing network continues to perform well in a challenging environment. For the first time in years, Intel fabs and our substrate supply are close to meeting our customers' demand. Using our IDM advantage, the team was able to remix almost 3 million units within lead time to meet changing demand signals. For example, we were able to partner with Meta to improve their Xeon supply and meet their needs. Finally, our supply chain resilience showed as our teams worked tirelessly to mitigate any significant disruptions to our factory operations from the war in Ukraine, supplier shutdowns, and COVID lockdowns in China. Turning to our business groups. At our Investor Day, we laid out our long-term growth strategy centered around 6 distinct but highly complementary business units, a structure that provides investment flexibility, increased market resilience and enhance transparency for investors. And in fact, we will report our results in this structure for the first time today. Our client group continues to deliver world-class platforms, positioning us to win share, grow ASP and win share of market. There is broad ecosystem agreement that the long-term PC market is sustainably larger going forward driven by PC density, refresh rates and increased penetration as the PC remains the essential tool for work, learn and play. We are seeing particular strength in gaming and in commercial PCs that is somewhat tempered by slower consumer, inflationary pressure and customer inventory management, which Dave will talk more to later. Our 12th gen Alder Lake family continues to ramp in Q1, and we have already shipped more than 15 million units. This family now has more than 250 designs planned this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Samsung and others. And it includes the world's fastest desktop processor, the Core i9-1200KS. Alder Lake will scale across every segment, including for businesses of all sizes with the launch of our latest vPro platform. vPro offers industry-leading manageability and security for business, including the first and only hardware-based ransomware detector with Intel Threat Detection. The strength of our client road map continues with Raptor Lake, where we are shipping both desktop and mobile samples to our customers today, and we plan to follow that with Meteor Lake in 2023. In data center, DCAI had strong year-on-year growth as customers continue to choose Intel and as we continue to deliver increasing value and innovation, we are seeing strength in both hyperscaler and enterprise, and we expect the market to grow double digits going forward, driven by workloads like AI and security. Here, too, we are seeing ecosystem supply constraints, particularly in Ethernet that have limited end system shipments, which we expect to be a headwind through the year. Our third-generation Intel Scalable processor Ice Lake has now shipped almost 4 million units and Amazon Web Services recently announced general availability of its EC2 I4i instance designed for storage and I/O intensive workloads. This is the 48th AWS instance powered by Ice Lake. I am also pleased to say that as committed, we began shipping initial SKUs of our fourth gen Intel Xeon scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids, to select customers in Q1. These are the first of many SKUs for Sapphire Rapids with more due to ramp throughout the remainder of the year. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map using performance and efficient cores delivered in a common platform, maximizing customer investments and on the cadence they prefer. Our first-generation E core Xeon will be Sierra Forest, which is designed to maximize performance per watt, providing high-density, ultraefficient compute for the cloud. For workloads that benefit from high performance per core and low latency like AI, we have our redefined Granite Rapids on Intel 3 with a new and improved P-Core. The strength of Intel Agilex and Stratix 10 FPGAs generated record revenue as we continue to win designs and ramp into key markets. Intel FPGA-based IPUs are deployed in volume at 5 of the top 6 cloud service providers, and we continue to win designs with comm service providers utilizing Intel's latest generation FPGAs and eASICs. Our launch of the Habana Gaudi-based AWS EC2 DL1 instance has shown end customers how they can reduce training costs by as much as 40% versus GPU-based instances. One of the early customers, Mobileye, is now using DL1 for training their object detection models. Gaudi 2 is already sampling the customers and demonstrating leadership performance versus competitive GPUs on multiple workloads. Finally, we continue to build our extensive data center software capabilities and recently announced the acquisition of Granulate. Granulate is a SaaS service that improves performance in cloud costs with its autonomous dynamic optimization service to unmodified customer workloads. The Network and Edge market continues to be strong with the transformation from proprietary fixed-function devices to fully programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Our Network and Edge Group is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transition and had record revenue in Q1. At Mobile World Congress, NEX launched our newest Xeon D processor, built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge, our latest Xeon D has more than 70 leading companies working on designs, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. We believe that in the network, O-RAN and vRAN, have reached a tipping point as the preferred model of all future network deployments. Nearly all commercial deployments running today are using Xeon and our FlexRAN software. We have more than 10 engagements with major global operators that we expect to be in high-volume commercial deployment within the next 2 years. We also launched a new version of our OpenVINO software toolkit, with downloads growing 70% year-over-year. Built on the foundation of One API, OpenVINO has enabled hundreds of thousands of developers to dramatically accelerate performance on rapidly growing AI workloads at the edge, including Z-block Computational who is using OpenVINO to deliver their AI MicroCloud solution to cities everywhere. Going forward, the scale out of 5G, the explosion of AI inferencing and the growth of low latency workloads will further drive the need for compute at the edge. They will eventually begin to shift compute from the cloud, making the edge the next wave of semiconductor growth. With a broad portfolio of hardware, software and deep ecosystem partnerships, NEX remains positioned to lead the transformation across the network and to win the edge. Moving to our emerging businesses. Our Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group builds on our installed base of CPUs, IP and software and leverages a thriving open ecosystem to disrupt a large and growing market. In Q1, AXG had strong growth and celebrated a major milestone with the official launch of the Intel Arc A Series portfolio for laptops. Alchemist, the first of these products has been shipping to customers since early Q1 with designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. The A-Series enables up to a 2x performance improvement in graphics versus integrated graphics and incorporates Intel Deep Link technology, which utilizes Intel integrated graphics to increase application performance by up to 30%. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now. These will be followed by even more powerful designs with Intel Arc 5 and Intel Arc 7, along with desktop and workstation offerings later this year. In the data center, our flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI is sampling to customers. Ponte Vecchio, along with Sapphire Rapids with high-bandwidth memory, will power the 2 Exaflop Aurora Supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition, Arctic Sound, our general purpose data center GPU designed for industry-leading media graphics and AI inference capabilities, will be available in the second half of the year. Finally, in Q1, we announced our intent to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies. Intel will help advance this technology in a responsible and sustainable way by developing energy-efficient computing technologies at scale. Blockscale, our first blockchain accelerator, is sampling today and will ship in production later this year. AXG remains on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. Our Intel Foundry Services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time as we continue to make progress towards being the trusted provider of foundry services. Our overall customer pipeline remains robust, and we now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages of engagement across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $5 billion. We have over 30 test chips committed to Intel 16 this year, and we expect the first Intel 3 and Intel 18a customer test chips to tape out in the second half of 2022. Our work with our 5 target anchor customers is progressing well. We expect additional updates later this year. Finally, we have seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for our acquisition of Tower. Tower shareholders recently approved the proposed acquisition. We have completed regulatory review in 2 jurisdictions outside the U.S. and hope to close the transaction as soon as possible. Building on its market leadership in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye Advanced system launches have continued, including the next-generation BMW 7 Series with the leading-edge combination of EyeQ5 and an 8-megapixel camera as well as BMW Highway Assistant, which enables hands-free driving on separated roadways up to 80 miles per hour. We also added Miami and Stuttgart to our global AV testing program, bringing the total number of places where we have tested AVs to 10 cities in 6 countries across 3 continents. Additionally, we recently showcased Mobileye's Level 4 self-driving system in action for the first time with a robotaxi navigating the streets of Jerusalem. Mobileye expects to launch its commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv by the end of 2022. And finally, we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value and are working on our plans to take Mobileye public in 2022. In March, we announced that we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC. The IPO is proceeding smoothly, and we continue to make good progress as we work with the SEC to refine our Form S-1. Before turning it over to Dave, I wanted to close with a few thoughts. First, I look forward to hosting our customers, partners and analysts at our Intel Vision event in Dallas on May 10 and 11. This will be our second Intel ON Series event dedicated to the future of business and technology. Next, as I said at our Investor Day, we believe we have a tremendous growth story over the next several years. We're investing in innovation and embracing an open approach to compute platforms and manufacturing. We continue to add to our incredible pool of technical talent. And of course, we remain intensely focused on rebuilding our execution machine. Finally, we'll continue to highlight our progress in key operational milestones as we manage within the financial framework we laid out in February. I know I speak for over 120,000 Intel employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Zinsner: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter, exceeding revenue, gross margin percentage and EPS guidance despite continued ecosystem supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. 3 of our 6 newly formed business segments: NEX; Mobileye and IFS, achieved record quarterly revenue. Revenue was $18.4 billion, slightly exceeding our guidance, led primarily by broad-based strength in our NEX business. Gross margin for the quarter was 53%, exceeding our guidance by 100 basis points on improved manufacturing yields and lower factory costs. EPS was $0.87, $0.07 above our guide on higher gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $5.9 billion and we received an additional $4.6 billion from the McAfee equity sale. Total cash and investments increased by $9.7 billion in the quarter to $39 billion, driven by the NAND divestiture and McAfee sale. CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion. Now turning to our newly formed business unit results. CCG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year on ramp down of the Apple CPU and modem business. The expected OEM inventory burn we cited in our Q4 call as well as lower consumer and education demand. CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was down 34% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. DCAI revenue was $6 billion, up 22% year-over-year on strong Xeon demand from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers. DCAI operating profit was flat year-over-year as increased revenue was offset by increased 10-nanometer mix, factory start-up charges and increased investment in our technology and product road map. NEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year on broad-based strength across the Cloud, Networking and Edge product lines. Operating profit was $366 million, up 51% year-over-year on higher revenue, offset by increased investment. Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $394 million, up 11% sequentially and 5% in comparison to Q1 '21, which saw exceptionally strong auto production and pipeline rebuilding due to COVID-related recovery last year. Operating profit was $148 million, down 13% year-over-year on increased investment in next-generation products. AXG revenue was $219 million, up 21% year-over-year on the ramp of its supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $390 million versus an operating loss of $176 million in Q1 '21, with the increase driven by new product qualification reserves on our Alchemist and Arctic Sound products, production ramp charges and increased investment. IFS revenue was $283 million, up 175% year-over-year on increased IMF tool shipments, increased automotive demand and initial revenue from Amazon and Cisco. Operating loss was $31 million, roughly flat year-over-year as revenue and gross margin increases were offset by increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. Moving to our full year and Q2 guidance. As Pat mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong end user demand for our products across each of our business units and we reaffirm our revenue guidance of $76 billion as lower than previously expected PC revenue is offset by NEX growth and DCAI hyperscale customer strength. More specifically, in our PC business, we continue to see strong commercial demand, offset by low-end consumer and education softness and the impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus. Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM for the year. As a result, we're seeing OEMs continue to lower inventory levels to better match demand and align with other system components. We expect elements of this inventory burn to continue in Q2, subsiding in the second half of the year. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year as a return to normal seasonality boost demand, OEM inventory burn subsides and the ramp of our leadership, Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products position us to compete per share. For DCAI, we also expect to see a stronger second half of the year as hyperscale customer demand remains robust, component supply improves and the ramp of Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapid\u2019s increased competitiveness. For NEX, we expect the strength we saw in Q1 to continue with growth throughout the year, fueled by improving component supply, continued 5G ramp and transformation at the edge. For AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. Finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS, as they ramp new products and secure new customers. For gross margin, we're guiding 52%, in line with the 51% to 53% range previously communicated. Note that the inflationary environment creates a headwind that we are continuing to monitor but we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost reduction programs as well as increased pricing in certain segments of the business. For EPS, we're guiding $3.60, $0.10 higher than prior guide on the Q1 beat and a slightly improved tax rate of 12%. Finally, net CapEx guidance of $27 billion and moderately negative adjusted free cash flow for the year remain unchanged. We have made significant progress on our smart capital initiatives, and we'll continue to manage within the framework communicated at Investor Day. Moving to Q2 guidance. For revenue, we're guiding $18 billion, down 2% sequentially on the short-term headwinds detailed earlier and the impact of an additional 14th week in Q1. For the lockdowns in Shanghai, we're estimating the impact to be relatively contained under the assumption that these restrictions are nearing an end. Even under a short lockdown, we anticipate it will take some time for the supply chain to normalize. And if the lockdowns persist or spread beyond Shanghai, we could see more material impacts to our outlook. For gross margin, we're guiding 51%, down approximately 200 basis points sequentially on increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and Raptor Lake prequalification reserves. We had always expected Q2 gross margin to be at the low end of our range and with our full year guide of 52%, we expect gross margin to inflect upward in the second half of the year as revenue increases and inventory reserve sell-through. Finally, we're guiding a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.70, down $0.17 sequentially on lower gross profit and higher OpEx. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.\nTony Balow: All right. Thank you, Dave. Moving on now to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.\nOperator: And our first question is coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Pat, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the inventory dynamic you're talking about. Your inventory is up internally, but you're talking about some of the inabilities to ship with match sets, et cetera, going forward. So can you guys just give a little more color on where the specific Intel inventory is versus a more generic inventory and shortage problem, specifically in the PC side of your business, it seems?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you, Ross. And I'll just start out by saying, again, I'm really pleased with the execution of our team and what had plenty of turbulence in Q1 and to meet and beat in Q1 was really spectacular. Now on the inventory piece, we did talk about that we are building 10-nanometer inventory. We have new products that we're ramping into the marketplace. And we do see some of those will be reversals as we go into the latter part of the year as that inventory will start flowing through the product area. So we would say this is very typical management of new product ramps and specifically around Sapphire Rapids, Alder Lake, we'll start seeing Raptor Lake as well. So those will be the key areas that you'll see that inventory shift occurring. Also, as we've indicated, we did see our customers' inventory burn down in Q1. We expect some of that to be in Q2 as well. But by the second half, we expect those adjustments and obviously the strength of second half outlook, we do expect much of that inventory burn to have finished in the first half and a strong second half as we're ramping our new products that will have much better performance feature, some of that with higher costs, but also coming with higher ASPs.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nTony Balow: Operator, why don't you go to the next caller. We can just come back to C.J. later.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I know you held the full year, but I mean the first half is kind of coming in lower, so it does kind of imply that you're taking the second half probably up versus the prior expectations. But in that light, obviously, we've got PCs that maybe look like they're at risk. You talked about China shutdowns that if they last longer, that could bring risk. You talked about issues, I guess, with server builds with your customers that you said would persist. I guess what gives you the confidence that things actually will be inflecting? And it looks like you're looking for kind of a hockey stick across all of your businesses in the second half to first? Like how do investors get confidence that that's after the way things are going to be playing out and that you've built enough conservatism in the guide? I guess, long story short, I'm asking why hold the annual guide in the wake of all that?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you, Stacy. And clearly, we overachieved in Q1, right? Q2, we were -- it's a little bit lighter, right? Given some of those, we've taken it down a bit, given some of those factors, but not substantially. This is very in line with what we expected. We were always forecasting a stronger second half of the year. And that's what gives us confidence. We have built into our year guide, some room, right, for things to happen. Like any good company would we built some expectations that not everything goes right. And that's why we're very confident in reaffirming our overall yearly revenue guidance. Now let's tease apart some of the factors that give us that confidence. First, we'd say, hey, we see strong growth in our DCAI business. We see strong growth in our NEX business. And particularly those areas, those are long lead time businesses with our customers. We have strong views of the business expectations that we have. We do see strength in the enterprise and governance business. First half to second half, you always see the normal cyclicality of the client business and particularly in the second half, we're going into a much stronger product line with Alder Lake and Raptor Lake and the reversal of inventories for Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids starting to hit there as well, which will be very nice to improve both operating gross margins as well as the revenue outlook. And then, right, we have an extraordinary set of products that were coming in the second half of the year. When you think about AXG, we have all of the discrete products ramping in addition to the mobile ones that we launched in Q1. We have our new GPU products with Arctic Sound. We have Ponte Vecchio ramping. We also have our blockchain products ramping. We have the new Xeons and NEX ramping, IFS is ramping. We see strength in our Mobileye business. So all of these give us confidence in the second half. And this is very consistent with the outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. We were always expecting this to be the characteristic of first half and second half. And obviously, a small beat in Q1, a little bit of weakness in Q2 that we've accounted for these disruptions and strength in the second half. We are on track to do exactly what we said at the Investor Day, and we're building momentum to accomplish exactly that, with the great execution that we saw in the first quarter around products, around manufacturing, around dealing with supply chain challenges. This machine is building momentum. We're confident in our second half outlook.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Apologies for the confusion earlier. I guess given the change in segments, I would love to try to set the stage here for what expectations should look like for the big 3, CCG, DCAI and NEX into Q2? And then for all of 2022, if there's any way you can kind of help plus or minus to the relative growth rates that you're guiding to for both June and the full year?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Thanks, C.J. And overall, this is the first quarter we're giving clear updates against the 6 business units. Clearly, that means things like DCAI, we're pulling out the NEX business from what might have been counted for before as part of data center. And we're giving clear views of how those businesses are performing, respectively. Overall, what we said in the client business, we'll see the seasonality plus a bit in the client business because of the strength of the product line. In DCAI, we see growth through the second half of the year. And we had strong year-on-year growth in the data center and AI business in Q1. And NEX, we expect that we're growing faster than the market. This is a good business for us. We're uniquely well positioned, and we see the strength of the Network and Edge being an area of particular growth. We were well over 20% growth rate in that business in Q1. So -- well, I don't think we'll see those kind of growth rates for the rest of the year, but a very strong growth businesses. But I'd also highlight that we are seeing the growth businesses, IFS, AXG and Mobileye being very strong growers for us, and they'll start more meaningfully as we go into the second half of the year, which is a little bit of the answer to Stacy's question before, solid growth across all of the business areas of the company, and we're starting to -- start seeing these new areas contribute in meaningful ways. So overall, affirming the second half of the year, seeing strength in all of the business areas, the product, the execution, all of them getting stronger.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: I'd like to focus on the 10-nanometer node and Intel 7. And maybe for you, Dave, first, you mentioned 100 basis points driven by improved yields. It's like really music to my ears, as you can imagine. And I'd love to hear a bit more, visibly this came as a surprise. So what's happening there? And could we hope for like continued improved deal on Intel 7 driving some positive surprise on the gross margin? Or should we assume that this node has a very little room to improve? And maybe for Pat on the same topic, Intel 7, I don't know if it reflects reality, but there is a lot of noise in the market about products ramping slowly, which is a cadence at which Sapphire Rapid is ramping. It seems a bit slow, a bit difficult. So my question in all candor is do these nodes, 10-nanometer and Intel 7, make it difficult to get into the market with products? Is that slowing the pace at which Intel can execute on the velocity of the road map? And should we expect things to go much, much faster when you move to Intel 4 and Intel 3?\nPat Gelsinger : So I'll start, and then I'll ask Dave to jump in. So overall, as we said, our 5 nodes in 4 years, we're performing well. Intel 7 is ramping more rapidly than we would have expected. Intel 4, we updated that we have Meteor Lake now powered on, which is our first product on Intel 4. Intel 3, we'll see the test wafers on that with our leadership products with Sierra Forest. In fact, just today, we taped out our first Granite Rapids compute die as well. We'll have the test wafers on 20a and 18a, which we expect to be a big foundry node as well. So I'll say, overall, the technology pipeline is doing tremendously well and really proud of our teams there. Intel 10, it's ramping very well. We're seeing good yields on that as Dave reflected, which overall gives us good momentum. In terms of products, Alder Lake has been a star, and it's ramping comfortably ahead of our expectations there, which has reaffirmed the health of Intel 7. Sapphire Rapids that you called out, it was first peer PRQs this quarter, and many of the additional SKUs, PRQ in Q2 -- in the second half of the year, and that's why you might be getting some of that views of the more muted ramp there. But we delivered on exactly what we said. First quarter PRQs of Sapphire Rapids, and we'll see strength in that as we go through the rest of the year. Also, Ice Lake has ramped very nicely now for our 10-nanometer server part. So overall, the technology and the manufacturing machine are performing quite well and really bode well for our outlook for this year and the years to come. So Dave, if you might add?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So we had a good quarter in the first quarter in terms of yields. We are going to see a little bit of pressure on 10-nanometer in the second quarter. That's part of the reason we're seeing margins down to the low end of our stated range of 51%. But we do expect 10 nanometer to become a tailwind for us as costs improve through the back half of the year. And although Intel 7 is behind that, we're expecting the same from Intel 7.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Dave, I think I heard you say CPU ASPs and client were up 25% year-over-year. It's a pretty big number. Is that -- how much of that is -- if I heard that right, how much of that is mix shift away from things like Chromebooks? How much of that is success with new products like Alder Lake? Can you just give us a little bit more color on the delta there?\nDavid Zinsner: I mean a lot of it is obviously mix, either shifting away from consumer education and newer product ramps. But as I said in the prepared remarks, given the inflationary environment, we are looking for targeted price increases in certain segments. So that really hasn't shown up that much yet, but will be part of the story going forward through the year.\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. And I'll just say, overall, the product line is healthy. We're seeing the mix shifts as you move to Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, being very strong, Ice lake as well. We'll start to see Sapphire Rapids factor into that in the second half of the year. So overall, we're coming into a stronger product cycle, Joe, right, which just gives us more opportunity to, right, to deliver higher value to customers, remix the products to higher price points. But overall, just have a more competitive product line as we go compete for market share as well.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: On Accelerated Computing and Graphics, client discrete GPU market is a pretty big market opportunity for Intel, right, $12 billion, $13 billion per year. So it looks like you guys started ramping your Arc GPU into notebooks now, your first gen product, the reviews look quite constructive. Is the team still on track to roll out desktop versions this quarter and still on track to ship 4 million plus discrete GPUs this year? And then any feedback from customers or gaming developers will be helpful as well.\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you, Harlan. And overall, AXG is on track. And we launched the mobile SKUs. We'll have the desktop SKUs coming in Q2. And we'll have more SKUs as we go through the year as well. We'll be filling out the product line. A lot of work, right, in qualifying games. And if you're a gamer, you know that there's just a lot of individual optimization work on some of the key titles so that work is underway, working with our OEMs to populate their portfolios of products as well. So I'll say you're going to see more and more of that hitting the market, and we'll be filling out -- we have the 3 versions. We'll have the 5, 7 and 9 versions of the year products coming out as we go build up that portfolio this year. And also, as I alluded to, AXG just has a boatload of products that is coming out across different segments, our high-performance computing products, our GPU products for data center, our blockchain of products. So in addition to the discrete graphics products, we have just a lot of products coming out of it. So overall, it's on track for the volume goals as well as for hitting the $1 billion revenue goal that we said at Investor Day as we go build, as we said, over the 5-year horizon to a $10-plus billion business. We see this as a great opportunity for us. And we have some unfair advantages with technologies like Deep Link, where we really get to build on the strong robust installed base that we have, the many years of software work that we've built into the foundations of the PC platform. So these are reasons that we do think that we have a great opportunity to build a major new business for us and one that's -- we're coming from a very small place into a very large market, a great growth opportunity for Intel that we're executing on aggressively.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: So the Q1 CapEx was about $4.6 billion, suggests a very big ramp in the back half to get to your $27 billion net CapEx target. We are hearing of a lot of constraints on equipment supply. I was hoping, Pat or David, if you could give us some color on the availability of tools and if there are any implications on your full year sales outlook because of the availability of tools?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes, I'll start with that one, and then Dave, you can add. Overall, CapEx is lumpy as we go through the year. And as such, we think overall that we'll still be on track to the overall CapEx target that we laid out. We are working very aggressively with the equipment companies. And we have deep, strong, long-term relationships there. And clearly, some of the '23 and '24 equipment goals are ones that we're working on aggressively right now, but we do feel comfortable that we have the supply chains lined up to meet our equipment objectives and really importantly, to meet the factory ramp cycles that we've laid out for the marketplace as we're opening up the new factories like we just announced. Our Oregon fab coming online. We have the next -- we're starting to take equipment now into our Ireland. We'll soon be doing that for our Israel fab ramp, we'll be groundbreaking on Ohio later this year. We'll be talking more about the German fab. So one by one, we're just executing on an aggressive build-out of our capital network and really quite pleased with the relationship that we have with the equipment companies to make that possible. That said, there definitely is some pressure on the equipment supply chain. We're also working closely with the equipment vendors. Many of them use Intel FPGAs. So we're working closely to make sure that we prioritize that piece of the demand to support them in that requirement. Dave, anything else you'd add?\nRoss Seymore: Yes. I would just add that we did expect this quarter to be a bit lower than the quarterly average for the year to get to the $27 billion. So it's not a complete surprise, although it was lumpy, as you said, and did come in a little bit lighter. But we feel good. I would say the other thing is that when you look at it, I think we feel confident about the $28 billion growth CapEx. The $27 billion net CapEx obviously assumes a $1 billion of capital offsets. And I'd say the early read and of course, we're still early in the year, but looks quite good. So there's a potential we could actually do a bit better on the offset side, so that the net CapEx could potentially be a little bit [good].\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMattRamsay: I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DCAI segment. The revenue, I guess, went from $5 billion to $6 billion from last year, and you have operating margin down, I guess, 7 points. And I guess it's no surprise after some of the disclosures that we had last year. But maybe you could tease that apart a little bit mix between enterprise and cloud, were there big changes there? And I guess the real question, Pat, is what gets that margin moving in the right direction? Is it the move to Sapphire, where you have multi-die products that might yield better? Is it revenue growth? I'm just trying to understand the drivers to turn around the operating margin in that segment as we go forward.\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. And I'll start on that one. Overall, the DCAI performed a little bit better than we expected for Q1. So I'd say overall, this is what we expected. The biggest factor on margins was the ramp of the 10-nanometer product line and the costs associated with that. So that was the biggest factor associated with it. As we're looking at that, there also was, I'll say, relative strength in the cloud piece of that business, the hyperscalers and the enterprise piece of the business was a little bit more constrained by match set. So we did see a little bit of that effect in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, we do see good outlooks on both the hyperscaler as well as on the enterprise and government side. We're working aggressively to solve the match set problems. So we are hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit better in that area if we are able to address some of the shortages that we've seen in areas like Ethernet. Obviously, as we go into the second half of the year, the product line gets stronger. As we see Sapphire Rapids ramp, we'll be launching products like Sapphire Rapids, HBM and the HPC segment, we\u2019ll be ramping Ice Lake more aggressively with higher volumes as we go into the second half of the year. So all of those start moving the product line in the right direction and margins commensurately with it. We also have gotten great response for the longer-term view of our segment and road map. And as we've laid out, we'll have both the efficient cores as well as the performance cores which better satisfy the market requirements. And I believe that will be a factor of better pricing as better -- as well as better margins over time because you're not trying to stretch one product across really 2 distinct segments of the marketplace and really having highly optimized products for both the hyperscaler as well as the broader enterprise requirements. So overall, we think that the strategy that we've laid out, we've gotten great response from our customers for, and as I already indicated, we're executing as we set Sapphire Rapids' first PRQs this quarter, many more as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be ramping that aggressively and seeing a good response from the customers. And I'd also say, particularly with Sapphire Rapids, every hyperscaler, every OEM has many SKUs lined up for this. This product will be extremely well respected, accepted and broadly deployed in the marketplace this year. Dave, anything else you would add?\nDavid Zinsner: I would just add, we set out a goal in the Investor Day for the company to have gross margins of 54% to 58% and call it, roughly 30% operating margin. And I think when we start to see the fruits of the investments we're making, both in terms of process technology that's weighing down on the COGS and the investments we're making in operating expense to build out the product portfolio and get to leadership, those things will start to show strong scale on the top line side. And so I would bet this business is accretive to our overall corporate average.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: I had two. I guess the first question is, TSMC is kind of pushing out the timing of the high-volume 3-nanometer EUV. And I guess the first question is sort of how that impacts your GPU and your CPU road map? And then I had a follow-up where really, Dave, I wanted to ask you on how you're going to account for subsidies? Are you going to account for those kind of in a contra account, so that as the depreciation ramps, you could offset some of that with that contrary account coming from subsidies?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. And on the first part of it, clearly, the implications of foundry timing is something we have to work very carefully. And there is not just a question of the timing of a node, it's also the capacity of nodes. And with some of those changes that have been reported in the industry, we're just working through that with our product teams to make sure that we're aligning well to the availability of the foundry technologies. But I would say that our IDM model just gives us fundamentally an advantaged business model here, where given the majority of our volumes are internal, we are able to balance between what we use externally for wafers and what we use internally for wafers. And thus, we're able to do a much better job satisfying our customers and having a more competitive product line. I'd also again add, Tim, that our execution of our 5 nodes in 4 years on or ahead of schedule across it, this just reinforces the competitiveness that we've described where we do see ourselves coming back to a position of unquestioned process technology leadership, and we're building out the manufacturing capacity at scale to deliver that to our customers. So IDM 2.0, well leveraging the foundries, but even more importantly, building leadership technologies with that scale manufacturing to deliver the most robust product line in the industry. So Dave?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, sure. So it somewhat depends on the -- which capital offset you're talking about, the grant are usually aligned with a certain set of assets. And so they are contra and they get depreciated over the same life cycle of the asset. Things like [Indiscernible] that we talked about is a bit more of a financing arrangement. So it doesn't necessarily have an impact on the P&L, but it will be shown on the capital statement as a capital offset, like a partner contribution that will reduce our cash flow burn we have. Prepays are handled more or less like they show up as an asset on the balance sheet. And as you ship products, you reduce that account. So it's somewhat dependent on which one we're talking about. But the one I think that you're talking about is the government incentives and yes, you're right there, they're contra accounts. They're on the contra account.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.\nTristan Gerra: How should we look at your discrete GPU platform in terms of expanding that beyond just consumer? And if you could talk about the software ecosystem that you might be building around to encourage adoption?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Thank you. And the answer is yes, we're going to be delivering the GPU products first for mobile, as we said, next for desktop. It will be game-centric as we're bringing them out of the marketplace. But we're also going to have a full lineup and we see actually some very unique advantages as we think about media, some of the professional developers where we're already demonstrating radically advantage that positions like on some of the advanced graphics and media artist product lines. So these will be areas of strength. Particularly when we bring our Arctic Sound product into the marketplace later this year, this will be well optimized for GPU environments and particularly will be strong in areas like encoding and media processing as well that if you think about cloud, you can certainly think about AI and training workloads, but many clouds are actually spending far more time on transcoding and media operations. So that will be an area of unique strength of our Arctic Sound product line. So and -- so if you think about that taken together, we'll be competing in the integrated graphics, the discrete graphics, the GPU business, the high-performance computing business will really be leveraging that technology across the entire space of the market. And that's part of the reason that we're very encouraged by our ability to ramp this into a very significant business for Intel and one where we have a lot of advantages to build upon.\nTony Balow: Okay. Last question?\nOperator: And our last question is coming from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC.\nSrini Pajjuri: Pat, I want to go back to the Sapphire Rapids ramp. Can you talk about how the ecosystem is coming together given that this is a new platform, especially in DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, et cetera? My question -- the real question is I just want to understand what your expectation for the ramp is versus the previous generations? Do you think this is going to be faster ramp versus Ice Lake? Or this is going to be a slower ramp? And also, when do you expect we'll see a public cloud instance based on Sapphire Rapids?\nPat Gelsinger : Yes. Great question, Srini. And clearly, one of the things that Intel as the market leader, right, the volume leader, it is this ability to ramp key new technologies. And with the Sapphire platform comes DDR5. And if we were talking 90 days ago, we were fighting through some challenges on DDR5 with the memory of suppliers and really working on debugging those interfaces. We now feel very confident that multiple suppliers are now qualified. We're seeing good momentum from the memory partners in this area, they're ramping up their supply chains for the Sapphire platform, right? It's really that one that brings a major new memory technology into the marketplace and really reinforces Intel as the leader in data center and server market. Overall, we're modeling very carefully, your exact question about looking at this versus the Ice Lake ramp. And our objective is to ramp this platform meaningfully faster than we did the Ice Lake platform. We're doing a lot of work for the software stack, the validation of that, making sure that we've really worked through all of the early sitings that customers would have, driving down the defect rates in the platform that our customers can ramp this at volume. And as I already indicated, we're seeing a tremendous amount of SKUs and instance types across all of the OEMs as well as all of the hyperscalers in the marketplace, and we're looking forward to those being broadly available in the second half of the year. As we -- and I think then maybe just wrapping up the call today, we're grateful for all of you joining us the opportunity to update you on the business. It's great that we start the year with a beat. We are looking at the momentum of the execution machine of Intel seeing solid progress, so 5 nodes in 4 years, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Arc launch, increasing momentum with our customers. We remain true to this building out of a geographically-balanced and more resilient supply chain. And there's just lots of good things in flight that gives us confidence, not only in Q2 but to reaffirm our guidance for the year. And our leadership team, we're fired up, and we believe that this is the greatest turnaround story in history, and it's my honor as the CEO of this great company to be able to be part of this leadership team. So thank you all for joining us today.\nTony Balow: All right. Thank you, Pat, and thank you for joining us today. Operator, can you please close the call?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was another solid quarter where we beat on the top line, exceeded our guidance on gross margin and EPS, and where we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy to unlock a $1 trillion market opportunity. As we laid out at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is built around 4 key pillars. We will deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. In Q1, we made great progress in all of these areas, and we are continuing to hold our full year revenue outlook. In our data center and AI group, we began shipping initial SKUs of Sapphire Rapids to select customers as planned. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map that strengthens our position in both per core performance and performance per watt for cloud and enterprise workloads. We launched our Arc A Series GPUs for laptops, taking our first steps to give the graphics industry a much needed new addition. Mobileye demonstrated its Level 4 self-driving system in Jerusalem, a major milestone in preparation for its upcoming robotaxi services. We continue to add to our talent with strong industry leaders like Christoph Schell, who recently joined us from HP as our Chief Commercial Officer. And finally, we took another major step in creating a balanced semiconductor supply chain with the announcement of our plans for new investments in Europe. We also held the grand opening of our latest leading-edge factory in Oregon, including a new name for the campus, the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler acres, which recognizes our founder and the site's unique contribution to driving Moore's Law. Q1 also marked a special moment for Intel as we announced our plans to further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions, including using 100% renewable energy across our global operations by 2030 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our global operations by 2040. Overall, Q1 was a great start to the year as we continue to execute on the path to our long-term growth story. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are executing at a torrid pace, and I remain confident in our path forward. Before I get into specific updates for each of our business units, let me start with some observations of what we are seeing in the industry. I continue to believe we are just at the beginning of a long-term growth cycle across semiconductors. We continue to see some match set limitations in areas like ethernet, some softening in low-end consumer PC and some inventory adjustments, as we discussed on our last call. But overall, the demand signals from customers continue to be robust in areas like enterprise, cloud, AI, graphics and networking. Semiconductors are the fuel of innovation and transformation across a wide range of industries. In the supply chain, lockdowns in Shanghai and the war in Ukraine have demonstrated more than ever that the world needs more resilient and more geographically-balanced semiconductor manufacturing. The chip shortage cost the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability. As an IDM, we believe we are in a good position in the industry to manage through these constraints. In fact, Intel is rising to meet this challenge. Following our announcements in Arizona, New Mexico and Ohio, we recently announced a series of investments in Europe, spanning our existing operations as well as our new investments in France and Germany, the Silicon Junction. These investments position Intel to meet the future growth and represent a significant step toward our moonshot goal of having half the world's semiconductor manufacturing located in the U.S. and Europe. The pace at which we can reach this goal is dependent on the actions of the U.S. and other governments. America showed leadership when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, but the global situation has grown even more serious since then. The EU has been very aggressive in moving legislation forward to meet this challenge, and I recently testified before the Senate to highlight the critical need for the U.S. to fund the CHIPS Act. I continue to encourage Congress to fund this critical legislation and enable us to move faster towards making a balanced semiconductor supply chain a reality. Turning now to Intel. We continue to make great progress on our plans to deliver 5 process nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is ramping extremely well with Alder Lake and on Intel 4, Meteor Lake has now successfully booted Windows, Chrome and Linux. The speed at which the team was able to achieve this milestone is a significant sign of the health of both Meteor Lake and our Intel 4 process technology. We plan to deliver several additional milestones in 2022, demonstrating our process technology development remains on track. This includes early Sierra Forest preproduction wafers on Intel 3, IP test wafers on Intel 28 and foundry customer test chips and initial IP shovels on Intel 18a. Simply put, we remain on and in some places, ahead of schedule to deliver 5 nodes in 4 years. Our manufacturing network continues to perform well in a challenging environment. For the first time in years, Intel fabs and our substrate supply are close to meeting our customers' demand. Using our IDM advantage, the team was able to remix almost 3 million units within lead time to meet changing demand signals. For example, we were able to partner with Meta to improve their Xeon supply and meet their needs. Finally, our supply chain resilience showed as our teams worked tirelessly to mitigate any significant disruptions to our factory operations from the war in Ukraine, supplier shutdowns, and COVID lockdowns in China. Turning to our business groups. At our Investor Day, we laid out our long-term growth strategy centered around 6 distinct but highly complementary business units, a structure that provides investment flexibility, increased market resilience and enhance transparency for investors. And in fact, we will report our results in this structure for the first time today. Our client group continues to deliver world-class platforms, positioning us to win share, grow ASP and win share of market. There is broad ecosystem agreement that the long-term PC market is sustainably larger going forward driven by PC density, refresh rates and increased penetration as the PC remains the essential tool for work, learn and play. We are seeing particular strength in gaming and in commercial PCs that is somewhat tempered by slower consumer, inflationary pressure and customer inventory management, which Dave will talk more to later. Our 12th gen Alder Lake family continues to ramp in Q1, and we have already shipped more than 15 million units. This family now has more than 250 designs planned this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Samsung and others. And it includes the world's fastest desktop processor, the Core i9-1200KS. Alder Lake will scale across every segment, including for businesses of all sizes with the launch of our latest vPro platform. vPro offers industry-leading manageability and security for business, including the first and only hardware-based ransomware detector with Intel Threat Detection. The strength of our client road map continues with Raptor Lake, where we are shipping both desktop and mobile samples to our customers today, and we plan to follow that with Meteor Lake in 2023. In data center, DCAI had strong year-on-year growth as customers continue to choose Intel and as we continue to deliver increasing value and innovation, we are seeing strength in both hyperscaler and enterprise, and we expect the market to grow double digits going forward, driven by workloads like AI and security. Here, too, we are seeing ecosystem supply constraints, particularly in Ethernet that have limited end system shipments, which we expect to be a headwind through the year. Our third-generation Intel Scalable processor Ice Lake has now shipped almost 4 million units and Amazon Web Services recently announced general availability of its EC2 I4i instance designed for storage and I/O intensive workloads. This is the 48th AWS instance powered by Ice Lake. I am also pleased to say that as committed, we began shipping initial SKUs of our fourth gen Intel Xeon scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids, to select customers in Q1. These are the first of many SKUs for Sapphire Rapids with more due to ramp throughout the remainder of the year. We also unveiled our expanded dual-track Xeon road map using performance and efficient cores delivered in a common platform, maximizing customer investments and on the cadence they prefer. Our first-generation E core Xeon will be Sierra Forest, which is designed to maximize performance per watt, providing high-density, ultraefficient compute for the cloud. For workloads that benefit from high performance per core and low latency like AI, we have our redefined Granite Rapids on Intel 3 with a new and improved P-Core. The strength of Intel Agilex and Stratix 10 FPGAs generated record revenue as we continue to win designs and ramp into key markets. Intel FPGA-based IPUs are deployed in volume at 5 of the top 6 cloud service providers, and we continue to win designs with comm service providers utilizing Intel's latest generation FPGAs and eASICs. Our launch of the Habana Gaudi-based AWS EC2 DL1 instance has shown end customers how they can reduce training costs by as much as 40% versus GPU-based instances. One of the early customers, Mobileye, is now using DL1 for training their object detection models. Gaudi 2 is already sampling the customers and demonstrating leadership performance versus competitive GPUs on multiple workloads. Finally, we continue to build our extensive data center software capabilities and recently announced the acquisition of Granulate. Granulate is a SaaS service that improves performance in cloud costs with its autonomous dynamic optimization service to unmodified customer workloads. The Network and Edge market continues to be strong with the transformation from proprietary fixed-function devices to fully programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Our Network and Edge Group is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transition and had record revenue in Q1. At Mobile World Congress, NEX launched our newest Xeon D processor, built specifically for software-defined infrastructure across the network and edge, our latest Xeon D has more than 70 leading companies working on designs, including Cisco, Juniper Networks and Rakuten Symphony. We believe that in the network, O-RAN and vRAN, have reached a tipping point as the preferred model of all future network deployments. Nearly all commercial deployments running today are using Xeon and our FlexRAN software. We have more than 10 engagements with major global operators that we expect to be in high-volume commercial deployment within the next 2 years. We also launched a new version of our OpenVINO software toolkit, with downloads growing 70% year-over-year. Built on the foundation of One API, OpenVINO has enabled hundreds of thousands of developers to dramatically accelerate performance on rapidly growing AI workloads at the edge, including Z-block Computational who is using OpenVINO to deliver their AI MicroCloud solution to cities everywhere. Going forward, the scale out of 5G, the explosion of AI inferencing and the growth of low latency workloads will further drive the need for compute at the edge. They will eventually begin to shift compute from the cloud, making the edge the next wave of semiconductor growth. With a broad portfolio of hardware, software and deep ecosystem partnerships, NEX remains positioned to lead the transformation across the network and to win the edge. Moving to our emerging businesses. Our Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group builds on our installed base of CPUs, IP and software and leverages a thriving open ecosystem to disrupt a large and growing market. In Q1, AXG had strong growth and celebrated a major milestone with the official launch of the Intel Arc A Series portfolio for laptops. Alchemist, the first of these products has been shipping to customers since early Q1 with designs from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and others. The A-Series enables up to a 2x performance improvement in graphics versus integrated graphics and incorporates Intel Deep Link technology, which utilizes Intel integrated graphics to increase application performance by up to 30%. The first laptops with Intel Arc 3 GPUs are available now. These will be followed by even more powerful designs with Intel Arc 5 and Intel Arc 7, along with desktop and workstation offerings later this year. In the data center, our flagship Ponte Vecchio GPU for high-performance computing and AI is sampling to customers. Ponte Vecchio, along with Sapphire Rapids with high-bandwidth memory, will power the 2 Exaflop Aurora Supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition, Arctic Sound, our general purpose data center GPU designed for industry-leading media graphics and AI inference capabilities, will be available in the second half of the year. Finally, in Q1, we announced our intent to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies. Intel will help advance this technology in a responsible and sustainable way by developing energy-efficient computing technologies at scale. Blockscale, our first blockchain accelerator, is sampling today and will ship in production later this year. AXG remains on track to deliver over $1 billion in revenue this year. Our Intel Foundry Services hit a $1 billion run rate for the first time as we continue to make progress towards being the trusted provider of foundry services. Our overall customer pipeline remains robust, and we now have more than 10 qualified opportunities in advanced stages of engagement across our process and package offerings that collectively represent a deal value of greater than $5 billion. We have over 30 test chips committed to Intel 16 this year, and we expect the first Intel 3 and Intel 18a customer test chips to tape out in the second half of 2022. Our work with our 5 target anchor customers is progressing well. We expect additional updates later this year. Finally, we have seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for our acquisition of Tower. Tower shareholders recently approved the proposed acquisition. We have completed regulatory review in 2 jurisdictions outside the U.S. and hope to close the transaction as soon as possible. Building on its market leadership in ADAS and AV solutions, Mobileye Advanced system launches have continued, including the next-generation BMW 7 Series with the leading-edge combination of EyeQ5 and an 8-megapixel camera as well as BMW Highway Assistant, which enables hands-free driving on separated roadways up to 80 miles per hour. We also added Miami and Stuttgart to our global AV testing program, bringing the total number of places where we have tested AVs to 10 cities in 6 countries across 3 continents. Additionally, we recently showcased Mobileye's Level 4 self-driving system in action for the first time with a robotaxi navigating the streets of Jerusalem. Mobileye expects to launch its commercial robotaxi services in Munich and Tel Aviv by the end of 2022. And finally, we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value and are working on our plans to take Mobileye public in 2022. In March, we announced that we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC. The IPO is proceeding smoothly, and we continue to make good progress as we work with the SEC to refine our Form S-1. Before turning it over to Dave, I wanted to close with a few thoughts. First, I look forward to hosting our customers, partners and analysts at our Intel Vision event in Dallas on May 10 and 11. This will be our second Intel ON Series event dedicated to the future of business and technology. Next, as I said at our Investor Day, we believe we have a tremendous growth story over the next several years. We're investing in innovation and embracing an open approach to compute platforms and manufacturing. We continue to add to our incredible pool of technical talent. And of course, we remain intensely focused on rebuilding our execution machine. Finally, we'll continue to highlight our progress in key operational milestones as we manage within the financial framework we laid out in February. I know I speak for over 120,000 Intel employees when I say that while we have work to do, our best days are ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thank you, Ross. And I'll just start out by saying, again, I'm really pleased with the execution of our team and what had plenty of turbulence in Q1 and to meet and beat in Q1 was really spectacular. Now on the inventory piece, we did talk about that we are building 10-nanometer inventory. We have new products that we're ramping into the marketplace. And we do see some of those will be reversals as we go into the latter part of the year as that inventory will start flowing through the product area. So we would say this is very typical management of new product ramps and specifically around Sapphire Rapids, Alder Lake, we'll start seeing Raptor Lake as well. So those will be the key areas that you'll see that inventory shift occurring. Also, as we've indicated, we did see our customers' inventory burn down in Q1. We expect some of that to be in Q2 as well. But by the second half, we expect those adjustments and obviously the strength of second half outlook, we do expect much of that inventory burn to have finished in the first half and a strong second half as we're ramping our new products that will have much better performance feature, some of that with higher costs, but also coming with higher ASPs. Yes. Thank you, Stacy. And clearly, we overachieved in Q1, right? Q2, we were -- it's a little bit lighter, right? Given some of those, we've taken it down a bit, given some of those factors, but not substantially. This is very in line with what we expected. We were always forecasting a stronger second half of the year. And that's what gives us confidence. We have built into our year guide, some room, right, for things to happen. Like any good company would we built some expectations that not everything goes right. And that's why we're very confident in reaffirming our overall yearly revenue guidance. Now let's tease apart some of the factors that give us that confidence. First, we'd say, hey, we see strong growth in our DCAI business. We see strong growth in our NEX business. And particularly those areas, those are long lead time businesses with our customers. We have strong views of the business expectations that we have. We do see strength in the enterprise and governance business. First half to second half, you always see the normal cyclicality of the client business and particularly in the second half, we're going into a much stronger product line with Alder Lake and Raptor Lake and the reversal of inventories for Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids starting to hit there as well, which will be very nice to improve both operating gross margins as well as the revenue outlook. And then, right, we have an extraordinary set of products that were coming in the second half of the year. When you think about AXG, we have all of the discrete products ramping in addition to the mobile ones that we launched in Q1. We have our new GPU products with Arctic Sound. We have Ponte Vecchio ramping. We also have our blockchain products ramping. We have the new Xeons and NEX ramping, IFS is ramping. We see strength in our Mobileye business. So all of these give us confidence in the second half. And this is very consistent with the outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. We were always expecting this to be the characteristic of first half and second half. And obviously, a small beat in Q1, a little bit of weakness in Q2 that we've accounted for these disruptions and strength in the second half. We are on track to do exactly what we said at the Investor Day, and we're building momentum to accomplish exactly that, with the great execution that we saw in the first quarter around products, around manufacturing, around dealing with supply chain challenges. This machine is building momentum. We're confident in our second half outlook. Yes. Thanks, C.J. And overall, this is the first quarter we're giving clear updates against the 6 business units. Clearly, that means things like DCAI, we're pulling out the NEX business from what might have been counted for before as part of data center. And we're giving clear views of how those businesses are performing, respectively. Overall, what we said in the client business, we'll see the seasonality plus a bit in the client business because of the strength of the product line. In DCAI, we see growth through the second half of the year. And we had strong year-on-year growth in the data center and AI business in Q1. And NEX, we expect that we're growing faster than the market. This is a good business for us. We're uniquely well positioned, and we see the strength of the Network and Edge being an area of particular growth. We were well over 20% growth rate in that business in Q1. So -- well, I don't think we'll see those kind of growth rates for the rest of the year, but a very strong growth businesses. But I'd also highlight that we are seeing the growth businesses, IFS, AXG and Mobileye being very strong growers for us, and they'll start more meaningfully as we go into the second half of the year, which is a little bit of the answer to Stacy's question before, solid growth across all of the business areas of the company, and we're starting to -- start seeing these new areas contribute in meaningful ways. So overall, affirming the second half of the year, seeing strength in all of the business areas, the product, the execution, all of them getting stronger. So I'll start, and then I'll ask Dave to jump in. So overall, as we said, our 5 nodes in 4 years, we're performing well. Intel 7 is ramping more rapidly than we would have expected. Intel 4, we updated that we have Meteor Lake now powered on, which is our first product on Intel 4. Intel 3, we'll see the test wafers on that with our leadership products with Sierra Forest. In fact, just today, we taped out our first Granite Rapids compute die as well. We'll have the test wafers on 20a and 18a, which we expect to be a big foundry node as well. So I'll say, overall, the technology pipeline is doing tremendously well and really proud of our teams there. Intel 10, it's ramping very well. We're seeing good yields on that as Dave reflected, which overall gives us good momentum. In terms of products, Alder Lake has been a star, and it's ramping comfortably ahead of our expectations there, which has reaffirmed the health of Intel 7. Sapphire Rapids that you called out, it was first peer PRQs this quarter, and many of the additional SKUs, PRQ in Q2 -- in the second half of the year, and that's why you might be getting some of that views of the more muted ramp there. But we delivered on exactly what we said. First quarter PRQs of Sapphire Rapids, and we'll see strength in that as we go through the rest of the year. Also, Ice Lake has ramped very nicely now for our 10-nanometer server part. So overall, the technology and the manufacturing machine are performing quite well and really bode well for our outlook for this year and the years to come. So Dave, if you might add? Yes. And I'll just say, overall, the product line is healthy. We're seeing the mix shifts as you move to Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, being very strong, Ice lake as well. We'll start to see Sapphire Rapids factor into that in the second half of the year. So overall, we're coming into a stronger product cycle, Joe, right, which just gives us more opportunity to, right, to deliver higher value to customers, remix the products to higher price points. But overall, just have a more competitive product line as we go compete for market share as well. Yes. Thank you, Harlan. And overall, AXG is on track. And we launched the mobile SKUs. We'll have the desktop SKUs coming in Q2. And we'll have more SKUs as we go through the year as well. We'll be filling out the product line. A lot of work, right, in qualifying games. And if you're a gamer, you know that there's just a lot of individual optimization work on some of the key titles so that work is underway, working with our OEMs to populate their portfolios of products as well. So I'll say you're going to see more and more of that hitting the market, and we'll be filling out -- we have the 3 versions. We'll have the 5, 7 and 9 versions of the year products coming out as we go build up that portfolio this year. And also, as I alluded to, AXG just has a boatload of products that is coming out across different segments, our high-performance computing products, our GPU products for data center, our blockchain of products. So in addition to the discrete graphics products, we have just a lot of products coming out of it. So overall, it's on track for the volume goals as well as for hitting the $1 billion revenue goal that we said at Investor Day as we go build, as we said, over the 5-year horizon to a $10-plus billion business. We see this as a great opportunity for us. And we have some unfair advantages with technologies like Deep Link, where we really get to build on the strong robust installed base that we have, the many years of software work that we've built into the foundations of the PC platform. So these are reasons that we do think that we have a great opportunity to build a major new business for us and one that's -- we're coming from a very small place into a very large market, a great growth opportunity for Intel that we're executing on aggressively. Yes, I'll start with that one, and then Dave, you can add. Overall, CapEx is lumpy as we go through the year. And as such, we think overall that we'll still be on track to the overall CapEx target that we laid out. We are working very aggressively with the equipment companies. And we have deep, strong, long-term relationships there. And clearly, some of the '23 and '24 equipment goals are ones that we're working on aggressively right now, but we do feel comfortable that we have the supply chains lined up to meet our equipment objectives and really importantly, to meet the factory ramp cycles that we've laid out for the marketplace as we're opening up the new factories like we just announced. Our Oregon fab coming online. We have the next -- we're starting to take equipment now into our Ireland. We'll soon be doing that for our Israel fab ramp, we'll be groundbreaking on Ohio later this year. We'll be talking more about the German fab. So one by one, we're just executing on an aggressive build-out of our capital network and really quite pleased with the relationship that we have with the equipment companies to make that possible. That said, there definitely is some pressure on the equipment supply chain. We're also working closely with the equipment vendors. Many of them use Intel FPGAs. So we're working closely to make sure that we prioritize that piece of the demand to support them in that requirement. Dave, anything else you'd add? Yes. And I'll start on that one. Overall, the DCAI performed a little bit better than we expected for Q1. So I'd say overall, this is what we expected. The biggest factor on margins was the ramp of the 10-nanometer product line and the costs associated with that. So that was the biggest factor associated with it. As we're looking at that, there also was, I'll say, relative strength in the cloud piece of that business, the hyperscalers and the enterprise piece of the business was a little bit more constrained by match set. So we did see a little bit of that effect in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, we do see good outlooks on both the hyperscaler as well as on the enterprise and government side. We're working aggressively to solve the match set problems. So we are hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit better in that area if we are able to address some of the shortages that we've seen in areas like Ethernet. Obviously, as we go into the second half of the year, the product line gets stronger. As we see Sapphire Rapids ramp, we'll be launching products like Sapphire Rapids, HBM and the HPC segment, we'll be ramping Ice Lake more aggressively with higher volumes as we go into the second half of the year. So all of those start moving the product line in the right direction and margins commensurately with it. We also have gotten great response for the longer-term view of our segment and road map. And as we've laid out, we'll have both the efficient cores as well as the performance cores which better satisfy the market requirements. And I believe that will be a factor of better pricing as better -- as well as better margins over time because you're not trying to stretch one product across really 2 distinct segments of the marketplace and really having highly optimized products for both the hyperscaler as well as the broader enterprise requirements. So overall, we think that the strategy that we've laid out, we've gotten great response from our customers for, and as I already indicated, we're executing as we set Sapphire Rapids' first PRQs this quarter, many more as we go through the rest of the year, and we'll be ramping that aggressively and seeing a good response from the customers. And I'd also say, particularly with Sapphire Rapids, every hyperscaler, every OEM has many SKUs lined up for this. This product will be extremely well respected, accepted and broadly deployed in the marketplace this year. Dave, anything else you would add? Yes. And on the first part of it, clearly, the implications of foundry timing is something we have to work very carefully. And there is not just a question of the timing of a node, it's also the capacity of nodes. And with some of those changes that have been reported in the industry, we're just working through that with our product teams to make sure that we're aligning well to the availability of the foundry technologies. But I would say that our IDM model just gives us fundamentally an advantaged business model here, where given the majority of our volumes are internal, we are able to balance between what we use externally for wafers and what we use internally for wafers. And thus, we're able to do a much better job satisfying our customers and having a more competitive product line. I'd also again add, Tim, that our execution of our 5 nodes in 4 years on or ahead of schedule across it, this just reinforces the competitiveness that we've described where we do see ourselves coming back to a position of unquestioned process technology leadership, and we're building out the manufacturing capacity at scale to deliver that to our customers. So IDM 2.0, well leveraging the foundries, but even more importantly, building leadership technologies with that scale manufacturing to deliver the most robust product line in the industry. So Dave? Yes. Thank you. And the answer is yes, we're going to be delivering the GPU products first for mobile, as we said, next for desktop. It will be game-centric as we're bringing them out of the marketplace. But we're also going to have a full lineup and we see actually some very unique advantages as we think about media, some of the professional developers where we're already demonstrating radically advantage that positions like on some of the advanced graphics and media artist product lines. So these will be areas of strength. Particularly when we bring our Arctic Sound product into the marketplace later this year, this will be well optimized for GPU environments and particularly will be strong in areas like encoding and media processing as well that if you think about cloud, you can certainly think about AI and training workloads, but many clouds are actually spending far more time on transcoding and media operations. So that will be an area of unique strength of our Arctic Sound product line. So and -- so if you think about that taken together, we'll be competing in the integrated graphics, the discrete graphics, the GPU business, the high-performance computing business will really be leveraging that technology across the entire space of the market. And that's part of the reason that we're very encouraged by our ability to ramp this into a very significant business for Intel and one where we have a lot of advantages to build upon. Yes. Great question, Srini. And clearly, one of the things that Intel as the market leader, right, the volume leader, it is this ability to ramp key new technologies. And with the Sapphire platform comes DDR5. And if we were talking 90 days ago, we were fighting through some challenges on DDR5 with the memory of suppliers and really working on debugging those interfaces. We now feel very confident that multiple suppliers are now qualified. We're seeing good momentum from the memory partners in this area, they're ramping up their supply chains for the Sapphire platform, right? It's really that one that brings a major new memory technology into the marketplace and really reinforces Intel as the leader in data center and server market. Overall, we're modeling very carefully, your exact question about looking at this versus the Ice Lake ramp. And our objective is to ramp this platform meaningfully faster than we did the Ice Lake platform. We're doing a lot of work for the software stack, the validation of that, making sure that we've really worked through all of the early sitings that customers would have, driving down the defect rates in the platform that our customers can ramp this at volume. And as I already indicated, we're seeing a tremendous amount of SKUs and instance types across all of the OEMs as well as all of the hyperscalers in the marketplace, and we're looking forward to those being broadly available in the second half of the year. As we -- and I think then maybe just wrapping up the call today, we're grateful for all of you joining us the opportunity to update you on the business. It's great that we start the year with a beat. We are looking at the momentum of the execution machine of Intel seeing solid progress, so 5 nodes in 4 years, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Arc launch, increasing momentum with our customers. We remain true to this building out of a geographically-balanced and more resilient supply chain. And there's just lots of good things in flight that gives us confidence, not only in Q2 but to reaffirm our guidance for the year. And our leadership team, we're fired up, and we believe that this is the greatest turnaround story in history, and it's my honor as the CEO of this great company to be able to be part of this leadership team. So thank you all for joining us today."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter, exceeding revenue, gross margin percentage and EPS guidance despite continued ecosystem supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. 3 of our 6 newly formed business segments: NEX; Mobileye and IFS, achieved record quarterly revenue. Revenue was $18.4 billion, slightly exceeding our guidance, led primarily by broad-based strength in our NEX business. Gross margin for the quarter was 53%, exceeding our guidance by 100 basis points on improved manufacturing yields and lower factory costs. EPS was $0.87, $0.07 above our guide on higher gross profit and slightly lower operating expenses. Operational cash flow for the quarter was $5.9 billion and we received an additional $4.6 billion from the McAfee equity sale. Total cash and investments increased by $9.7 billion in the quarter to $39 billion, driven by the NAND divestiture and McAfee sale. CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion. Now turning to our newly formed business unit results. CCG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year on ramp down of the Apple CPU and modem business. The expected OEM inventory burn we cited in our Q4 call as well as lower consumer and education demand. CPU ASPs were up greater than 25% year-over-year on richer mix and strong demand for our high-end mobile and desktop products across both our commercial and consumer segments. Operating profit was down 34% year-over-year on lower revenue, increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and increased spending to further strengthen our product and platform road map. DCAI revenue was $6 billion, up 22% year-over-year on strong Xeon demand from both our hyperscale and enterprise customers. DCAI operating profit was flat year-over-year as increased revenue was offset by increased 10-nanometer mix, factory start-up charges and increased investment in our technology and product road map. NEX achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year on broad-based strength across the Cloud, Networking and Edge product lines. Operating profit was $366 million, up 51% year-over-year on higher revenue, offset by increased investment. Mobileye achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $394 million, up 11% sequentially and 5% in comparison to Q1 '21, which saw exceptionally strong auto production and pipeline rebuilding due to COVID-related recovery last year. Operating profit was $148 million, down 13% year-over-year on increased investment in next-generation products. AXG revenue was $219 million, up 21% year-over-year on the ramp of its supercompute and Alchemist discrete GPU products. Operating loss was $390 million versus an operating loss of $176 million in Q1 '21, with the increase driven by new product qualification reserves on our Alchemist and Arctic Sound products, production ramp charges and increased investment. IFS revenue was $283 million, up 175% year-over-year on increased IMF tool shipments, increased automotive demand and initial revenue from Amazon and Cisco. Operating loss was $31 million, roughly flat year-over-year as revenue and gross margin increases were offset by increased investment to build out the custom foundry business. Moving to our full year and Q2 guidance. As Pat mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong end user demand for our products across each of our business units and we reaffirm our revenue guidance of $76 billion as lower than previously expected PC revenue is offset by NEX growth and DCAI hyperscale customer strength. More specifically, in our PC business, we continue to see strong commercial demand, offset by low-end consumer and education softness and the impact of no longer shipping to customers in Russia and Belarus. Further, component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact on PC TAM for the year. As a result, we're seeing OEMs continue to lower inventory levels to better match demand and align with other system components. We expect elements of this inventory burn to continue in Q2, subsiding in the second half of the year. Although these headwinds have reduced our CCG revenue forecast, we expect CCG revenue to increase in the second half of the year as a return to normal seasonality boost demand, OEM inventory burn subsides and the ramp of our leadership, Alder Lake and Raptor Lake products position us to compete per share. For DCAI, we also expect to see a stronger second half of the year as hyperscale customer demand remains robust, component supply improves and the ramp of Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapid's increased competitiveness. For NEX, we expect the strength we saw in Q1 to continue with growth throughout the year, fueled by improving component supply, continued 5G ramp and transformation at the edge. For AXG, we continue to expect full year revenue greater than $1 billion, driven by the launch and ramp of the Alchemist, Arctic Sound-M, Ponte Vecchio and Blockscale products. Finally, we expect to see second half growth in each of our 2 remaining businesses, Mobileye and IFS, as they ramp new products and secure new customers. For gross margin, we're guiding 52%, in line with the 51% to 53% range previously communicated. Note that the inflationary environment creates a headwind that we are continuing to monitor but we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost reduction programs as well as increased pricing in certain segments of the business. For EPS, we're guiding $3.60, $0.10 higher than prior guide on the Q1 beat and a slightly improved tax rate of 12%. Finally, net CapEx guidance of $27 billion and moderately negative adjusted free cash flow for the year remain unchanged. We have made significant progress on our smart capital initiatives, and we'll continue to manage within the framework communicated at Investor Day. Moving to Q2 guidance. For revenue, we're guiding $18 billion, down 2% sequentially on the short-term headwinds detailed earlier and the impact of an additional 14th week in Q1. For the lockdowns in Shanghai, we're estimating the impact to be relatively contained under the assumption that these restrictions are nearing an end. Even under a short lockdown, we anticipate it will take some time for the supply chain to normalize. And if the lockdowns persist or spread beyond Shanghai, we could see more material impacts to our outlook. For gross margin, we're guiding 51%, down approximately 200 basis points sequentially on increased 10-nanometer and Intel 7 mix and Raptor Lake prequalification reserves. We had always expected Q2 gross margin to be at the low end of our range and with our full year guide of 52%, we expect gross margin to inflect upward in the second half of the year as revenue increases and inventory reserve sell-through. Finally, we're guiding a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.70, down $0.17 sequentially on lower gross profit and higher OpEx. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions. Yes. So we had a good quarter in the first quarter in terms of yields. We are going to see a little bit of pressure on 10-nanometer in the second quarter. That's part of the reason we're seeing margins down to the low end of our stated range of 51%. But we do expect 10 nanometer to become a tailwind for us as costs improve through the back half of the year. And although Intel 7 is behind that, we're expecting the same from Intel 7. I mean a lot of it is obviously mix, either shifting away from consumer education and newer product ramps. But as I said in the prepared remarks, given the inflationary environment, we are looking for targeted price increases in certain segments. So that really hasn't shown up that much yet, but will be part of the story going forward through the year. I would just add, we set out a goal in the Investor Day for the company to have gross margins of 54% to 58% and call it, roughly 30% operating margin. And I think when we start to see the fruits of the investments we're making, both in terms of process technology that's weighing down on the COGS and the investments we're making in operating expense to build out the product portfolio and get to leadership, those things will start to show strong scale on the top line side. And so I would bet this business is accretive to our overall corporate average. Yes, sure. So it somewhat depends on the -- which capital offset you're talking about, the grant are usually aligned with a certain set of assets. And so they are contra and they get depreciated over the same life cycle of the asset. Things like [Indiscernible] that we talked about is a bit more of a financing arrangement. So it doesn't necessarily have an impact on the P&L, but it will be shown on the capital statement as a capital offset, like a partner contribution that will reduce our cash flow burn we have. Prepays are handled more or less like they show up as an asset on the balance sheet. And as you ship products, you reduce that account. So it's somewhat dependent on which one we're talking about. But the one I think that you're talking about is the government incentives and yes, you're right there, they're contra accounts. They're on the contra account."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we'll hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the culmination of a year of tremendous progress towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. We consistently executed on our plan to reestablish process leadership, further build out our capacity and foundry plans, greatly improved product execution and began to execute on our mission to bring AI everywhere across our product segments. We delivered solid Q4 results exceeding expectations for the fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was at the higher end of our guidance, and we had strong EPS upside as a result of our ongoing relentless focus on driving operating leverage and expense management, including comfortably meeting our $3 billion cost savings commitment for fiscal year '23. 2023 was definitely a year when we did what we said we would do and more. We intend to make 2024 another such year. And when we look out over the next 12 months, we are confident that we can continue to drive considerable progress on our IDM 2.0 journey. As we look into Q1, our core business, including client server and edge products continues to perform well and is tracking to the lower end of seasonal. However, discrete headwinds, including Mobileye, PSG and business exits, among others, are impacting overall revenue, leading to a lower Q1 guide. Importantly, we see this as temporary, and we expect sequential and year-on-year growth in both revenue and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year '24. Momentum and excitement around new products and businesses remain strong as we head into the year and will grow stronger as the year progresses. We could not be prouder of the execution across our process technology roadmap in 2023 and we became the world's first high-volume manufacturer of logic devices using EUV, both the U.S. and Europe as we aggressively ramped Core Ultra on Intel 4 in both Oregon and Ireland. Intel 3 achieved manufacturing readiness in Q4 as committed with solid performance in year progression. Our two lead vehicles in Intel 3 are on track, and we look forward to launching Sierra Forest in first half '24 followed shortly thereafter by Granite Rapids. Sierra Forest has final samples at customers and the production stepping of Granite Rapids is running ahead of schedule well into power-on validation and very healthy. We are even more excited about breaking into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, the latter unexpected two years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half '24, completing our five nodes in four year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into Fab shortly. As we complete our goal of five nodes in four years, we are not satisfied nor are we finished. We have begun installation of the industry's first high NA EUV tool in our most advanced technology development site in Oregon aimed at addressing challenges beyond 18A. We remain focused on being good stewards of Moore's Law and ensuring a continuous node migration path over the next decade and beyond. Third-party engagements with IFS continue to validate our progress on process technology. We launched IFS with a long-term view of delivering the world's first system foundry that brings together a secure and sustainable supply chain with the best of Intel and our ecosystem. While our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year '23 towards our goal of becoming the second largest external foundry by 2030. The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP is now one of the largest, fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market. We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA design services, IP, cloud and U.S. military aerospace and government. Critical agreements with ARM and Synopsys continue to gain momentum. We delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States Government and Department of Defense. We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile, communication infrastructure and networking. This expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site. Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed the Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the 3 Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and U.S. capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four inclusive of a meaningful prepay and our momentum continues to grow. Our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another important advantage for IFS, a faster on-ramp to broader foundry relationships. During the quarter, we captured three additional advanced packaging design wins, bringing the total to five in 2023, with the majority of revenue starting in 2025. To support our growing demand, just yesterday, we opened Fab 9 in New Mexico, marking a milestone for high-volume 3D advanced packaging manufacturing. The momentum in advanced packaging is very strong and is another facet of our foundry strategy, which is clearly benefiting from the surge of interest in AI. With leadership technology and available capacity, our opportunity set continues to grow. In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, our lifetime deal value for IFS is now over $10 billion, more than doubling from the $4 billion we provided in our last update. Supporting our growing momentum in IFS is our global manufacturing footprint we are the only semiconductor company with that scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world providing ourselves and our foundry customers resilient access to the right capacity in the right regions at the right time. All of our expansion projects in the U.S., EU and Asia are progressing on schedule, and our chips applications in the U.S. and EU are progressing well. Finally, we are thrilled to be hosting our first Foundry Day, IFS Direct Connect on February 21 in San Jose where we will have the opportunity to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem as well as begin to talk about our process roadmap beyond Intel 18A, next-generation packaging and our full foundry vision. We hope to see many of you there. Intel continues its mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. And given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic. We have already discussed how our 50-year heritage and high-performance computing transistors and our advanced packaging positions IFS to benefit from the accelerating move to AI. Within our product portfolio, we are the only company with the products, IP and ecosystem reach to empower customers to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications from the cloud through the network, into the enterprise client and edge. For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive ML perf benchmarks and leadership TCO. As AI proliferates and the world moves towards more AI integrated application, there's a market shift toward local inferencing and smaller, more nimble models. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inferencing cost and round trip latency. With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra ushering in the AI PC era and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of clients and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than requiring it in the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. In Q4, our server business experienced solid sequential growth, consistent with market share, which we believe was flat with Q3 levels. Since launching 4th Gen Xeon in early 2023, we have shipped more than 2.5 million units with approximately 1/3 of all 4th Gen demand driven by AI. With our 5th Gen Xeon launch, we enable up to 42% higher AI inference performance compared to the industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. 5th Gen Xeon has reached general availability at Alibaba is entering public and private previews with several CSPs and is on track to ship with OEMs next month. More importantly, our improved execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon ramping well, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids coming soon and Clearwater Forest already going into the fab. Momentum is building and positioning us well to win back share in the data center. Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs. In a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing. We're building on this momentum with Gaudi 3, which is on track to launch this year and is expected to deliver performance leadership with 4x the processing power and double the networking bandwidth for greater scale out performance. Gaudi 3 is now in the lab, powered on and showing great health and performance and Falcon Shores is also well underway. Our accelerator pipeline for 2024 grew double digits sequentially in Q4 and is now well above $2 billion and growing. We recently increased our supply for both Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 to support the growing customer demand and we expect meaningful revenue acceleration throughout the year. As we announced last quarter, we are now operating PSG as a standalone business beginning on January 1. Our intent is to bring in private capital this year to create an eventual path to an IPO over the coming years. As we outlined on our Q3 call, PSG is in the midst of an industry-wide cyclical correction for FPGAs, which we expect to last through the first half of '24. Despite the financial correction, operational momentum is strong and PSG executed its most ambitious FPGA roadmap, delivering 21 new product releases in 2023 and executing supply assurance agreements valued by our customers. Finally, even as we congratulate Sandra Rivera, the new CEO of PSG, I am extremely pleased to welcome Justin Hotard as Executive Vice President and General Manager of DCAI. Justin joined us from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he was Executive Vice President and General Manager of High Performance Computing AI and Labs. He will play a key role in helping customers accelerate their businesses with our Xeon processor family, delivering on our commitments to customers and partners by increasing our GPU and accelerator footprint and supporting our mission to bring AI everywhere. Moving to client. CCG performed very well in Q4, posting the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. Demand reflected a normalized inventory environment of sustained strength in gaming and commercial with our highest end SKUs exceeding Q3 records by 20%. The 2023 consumption TAM was roughly 270 million units consistent with our views entering the year, and we expect the PC TAM up low single digits year-on-year in 2024, in line with third-party estimates. Our share position is strong, and our product portfolio for 2024 and beyond and ecosystem work will continue to drive industry-leading performance and experiences. In Q4, we ushered in the age of the AI PC with the launch of Intel Core Ultra. Representing our largest architectural shift in decades, the Core Ultra is the most AI-capable and power-efficient client processor with dedicated acceleration capabilities across the CPU, GPU and Neural Processing Unit or NPU. Ultra is the centerpiece of the AI PC, systems that are capable of natively running popular $10 billion parameter models and drive superior performance on key AI-enhanced applications like Zoom, Adobe and Microsoft. We expect to ship approximately 40 million AI PCs in 2024 alone with more than 230 designs from ultrathin PCs to handheld gaming devices to be delivered this year from OEM partners, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, MSI, Samsung Electronics and others. The Core Ultra platform delivers leadership AI performance today with our next-generation platforms launching later this year, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake tripling our AI performance. In 2025 with Panther Lake, we will grow AI performance up to an additional 2x. NEX is well positioned to benefit from the proliferation of AI workloads on the edge where our market-leading hardware and software assets provides improved latency, reliability and cost. OpenVINO adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4 and today is a core software layer for AI inferencing on the edge, on the PC and in the data center. NEX is also driving the shift of AI networking in the cloud from proprietary technologies to open Ethernet-based approaches in partnership with a broader industry ecosystem. NEX Q4 results beat our internal forecast and the division is poised for solid growth in 2024 across edge network and ethnic products more skewed to the second half. Yet another growing market opportunity for us is automotive. While Mobileye is experiencing a sharp inventory correction in Q1, we are encouraged by their improving forecast throughout 2024 and more importantly, the recent announcement at CES that they were awarded a series of production design wins by a major Western automaker across the company's three key platforms: SuperVision, Chauffeur and Drive. In addition to Mobileye's strengths in AV, at CES, we announced the launch of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle, SoCs with Geely\u2019s Zeekr brand as our first OEM partner and our agreement to acquire Silicon Mobility, a fabulous silicon and software company specializing in power management SoCs focused on EVs. These announcements build on shared IP across clients and data center and our existing Intel SoC footprint of more than 50 million vehicles worldwide. Our strategy will continue to broaden our exposure to the growing auto market on both the product and the foundry sides of our business. Finally, underpinning our across-the-board progress in 2023 is our operational and financial discipline. As our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency, accountability and focus on cost begins to take root, we expect to unlock further cost savings and efficiencies in 2024 and beyond. We have officially transitioned to this new operating model on January 1, and we'll report the new segmentation format as part of our Q1 earnings. We see incremental efficiencies as we drive to our long-term model of 60% gross and 40% operating margins. As I reflect on our progress in 2023, I am incredibly proud of our employees whose commitment and perseverance were instrumental to the execution of our ambitious strategy. Together, we exited the year accomplishing exactly what we set out to do. We improved our execution engine consistently being on track or ahead on our process and product roadmap. And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are confident in our performance and financial trajectory for the year ahead. We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate. We will maintain our relentless focus on our mission and commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn things over to David.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter on top of continued execution of our products and process roadmap commitments. We again beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. We've taken proactive steps to prioritize our investments, aggressively manage near-term expenses and made meaningful progress on reducing our structural cost gaps. We exit 2023 a healthier and leaner company, but there is much more work to do in 2024 and beyond to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and the potential of IDM 2.0. Fourth quarter revenue was $15.4 billion, up 9% sequentially, 10% year-over-year and $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance with solid execution across reported segments. Gross margin was 48.8%, 230 basis points better than our guidance, driven by favorable product mix and ASPs, improved unit costs and higher revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.54, beating guidance by $0.10 on improved gross margins, stronger revenue and disciplined OpEx management. Q4 operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Net inventory was down more than $300 million and nine days in the quarter, and DSO remains under 20. Net CapEx was $5.9 billion resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Moving to the fourth quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, up 12% sequentially, 33% year-over-year and ahead of internal expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. We saw sustained strength in gaming and commercial segments, along with record performance notebook shipments in the quarter. Customer inventory levels have normalized and 2023 PC consumption was in line with our 270 million unit forecast. Operating profit was $2.9 billion, up more than $800 million sequentially and nearly $2.4 billion year-over-year on improved TAM and market share and sell-through of reserved inventory. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, up 4% sequentially. The server business delivered double-digit growth sequentially, partially offset by the FPGA inventory correction. Revenue was driven by improved unit TAM, stable share and rising average core density contributing to record Xeon ASPs. Operating profit was $78 million, roughly flat sequentially as advanced node development costs continue to weigh on profitability. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% sequentially and ahead of internal expectations on strength from network and Ethernet segments. The business saw an operating loss of $12 million, down modestly quarter-over-quarter. Intel Foundry Services contributed revenue of $291 million, down modestly on a sequential basis and up 63% year-over-year on increased traditional packaging revenue. IFS operating loss was $113 million, driven by continued investment to develop and grow world-class systems foundry. Mobileye delivered record revenue of $637 million, up 20% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, along with record operating profit of $242 million, up 42% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Recently disclosed design wins are expected to contribute more than $7 billion of future revenue or more than 3.5x Mobileye's record FY '23 revenue. As Pat summarized, the company made significant progress towards our IDM 2.0 strategy including strong execution against our 2023 financial commitments despite macro headwinds throughout the year. As committed at our Q1 '23 earnings call, we delivered revenue gross margin, operating margin and EPS growth each quarter. Despite significant investments in future growth and continued progression through five nodes in four years, we achieved our 2023 commitment of $3 billion of spending reductions. Through a strong focus on cash and cost controls, we achieved excellent DSO and DPO in the second half of 2023, and delivered net inventory reductions of nearly $2 billion and 35 days from our peak in Q1 '23. Working capital initiatives yielded roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023, helping us to meet our commitment for roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow in the second half of the year. We remain committed to our smart capital framework with growing contributions from our Skip agreement with Brookfield and progress toward government incentives in the U.S., Europe and Israel. In Q4, we also recognized $845 million of advanced manufacturing investment credits or AMIC, as defined in the CHIPS Act. While our continued IDM 2.0 capital investments will result in increased gross CapEx in '24 as compared to '23, we're on track to our aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of net CapEx spending in the mid-30s as a percent of revenue, with offsets towards the high end of the 20% to 30% range. Now turning to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion. At the Q1 revenue midpoint of $12.7 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 44.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.13. While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG. Additionally, we expect a significant drop in IFS revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment buying in the first half of the year, impacting the IMS business. When combined with businesses we exited in 2023, we expect a roughly $1 billion sequential revenue impact from businesses outside of our core products. With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024, consistent with third-party views. Our recent results show the PC remains essential, and we remain confident in our longer-term TAM forecast as the age of the AI PC further enhances the value of device refresh. We expect Q1 data center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio with well over $2 billion in pipeline to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our Network, FNIC and Edge products. These signals give us confidence that consolidated revenue will grow beyond typical seasonality after a soft Q1. And that we can deliver sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and EPS each quarter of 2024. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering five nodes in four years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion. We expect depreciation to grow by approximately $2 billion in 2024, in addition to a significant increase in variable factory start-up costs. 60% gross margin flow-through as a percent of revenue growth remains a rule of thumb in aggregate in the intermediate term, though we may see volatility in our quarterly gross margin results. We're excited to mark the first month fully operating under our new internal foundry reporting structure with improved accountability, transparency around cost and value drivers and increased focus on driving higher rates of return for our owner's capital. We intend to provide you with the recast historical financials this quarter in the form of an 8-K. We will unpack the details at that time, but you will see not only the first view of our manufacturing P&L, but a view of our products group more in line with external peers. While come as no surprise, our manufacturing P&L is under significant pressure as we get back to process leadership and build the infrastructure to meet both internal and external demand, we see abundant opportunity to drive improvement. Finally, standing up a separate legal entity for manufacturing, technology development and IFS is important to our foundry customers. We expect to have that structure in place in the second half of 2024. As we look back at 2023, we have a lot to be proud of. We entered the year with a challenging macro backdrop. I'm pleased with our team's efforts, controlling spending, ramping new products, managing share, executing product and process roadmaps and delivering for our customers. We continue to focus our portfolio by exiting five businesses in 2023 for a total of 10 since past return. While also identifying profitable adjacent markets, we can serve with our existing IP as we have done with Intel Auto. We executed within our Smart capital framework and are beginning to see meaningful capital offsets. We unlocked value for our shareholders through Mobileye and IMS and announced our intention to pursue external investments in PSG. I'd like to thank the entire Intel team for the hard work and execution, which drove our improved 2023 results. While we aren't yet where we want to be from a financial perspective, we're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market and with the strong foundation of financial discipline we set in 2023, we're confident and committed to our long-term financial objectives. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Pitzer: We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I have a near-term one and then for my follow-up would be a longer-term one. So the near-term one is on the demand picture. Dave, you were helpful in breaking up kind of the non-core impacts in the first quarter versus the core, but the low end of seasonality is a little bit of a surprise given that cyclical pressures seem to have been abating and some of the market share trends should have been going in your favor, at least also not worsening. So can you just talk a little bit about why you're at the low end of seasonality in the first quarter for your core businesses and what gives you confidence in super seasonality thereafter?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Hi, thanks, Ross. I'll start and ask Dave to follow-up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1? There's a wide range of perspectives, anywhere from 3% to 20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement, of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built the forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast, but the core business we see is healthy. For it, we see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger. So, we'll say it really reflects as we view the market, but we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, like improving on revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year. And we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. And obviously, as the year improves, new product lines are merging, tailwinds in areas like AIPC, Gaudi ramping for accelerators. Overall, a lot of things just keep improving as we go through the year. Combined with good cost discipline, we feel quite comfortable that we're starting strong and we're going to have an improving year as the year progresses.\nDavid Zinsner: And what's the long-term question, Ross?\nRoss Seymore: You just, the confidence in, oh, the second half. The long-term question is one, yes, sorry. The long-term question is one of the manufacturing nodes. The five nodes in four years is going well, but one of your biggest foundry, well, customers and competitors is doubling down on their ability to keep the leadership positioning. So what gives you confidence that 18A will in fact have the leadership node? And how do we reconcile the fact that you seem to be using that customer as a foundry partner for some of your heterogeneous products, whether it be Arrow Lake or Lunar Lake going forward? If you have the leadership, why wouldn't you be doing that internally?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. I'll do that and ask Dave for pile on both of those a little bit. But with respect to the manufacturing, I'll just say, hey, we look at this every single day and we're scrutinizing carefully our progress on 18A. And obviously the great news that we just described those Clearwater Forest taping out, that gives us a lot of confidence that 18A is healthy. That's a major product for us. Panther Lake following that shortly. We've also had our fourth customer this quarter. Some of the IP providers are giving us very strong affirmation on the competitiveness of the process technology. And particularly, we're just way ahead on backside power. And that's not even, everybody in the industry is recognizing that. And many of the customers who are looking at it are seeing substantial gains, not just in power performance, but in area savings as well. So overall, we feel very confident that our roadmap is strong in the process technology side. We do use external foundries and obviously that grew as we were dealing with some of our own challenges for process competitiveness. And as we create more and more focus in the business, more wafers will come in internal to the Intel factory network. But long-term, we're going to continue to use external foundries to complement, manage our capital requirements. And to make sure that our teams always are building the best products in the industry and using the best technologies to accomplish that. So overall, we feel super good with our strategy. You'll see more use of our own factory network, even as we leverage external foundries where appropriate.\nDavid Zinsner: The only other thing I'd add is, just the use of external foundries as part of our smart capital strategy. It's one of the five pillars. So as Pat said, that will continue to be part of our strategy. Obviously, we're going to maximize how much we can do internally, but we're always going to be using external foundries based on smart capital.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Dave. I had a question about gross margin. It was obviously much, much better in December, and the March guidance is actually pretty good. So does this include the sale of any previously written down inventory and maybe help us get a clean margin number? Is this March number pretty clean that we can carry that incremental forward through the year?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I mean - what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall through is probably the best rule of thumb. That said, as you know, quarter-to-quarter, things can move that number up and down. In Q4, we saw a better fall through. Largely, it was related to a better sell through of previously reserved product. We also actually did better on the factory side in terms of spending and yield. And so that also benefited us to some extent. And then in Q1, I think we're going to do a little worse. We're going to see the fall through be a little harder on us. And largely, that's some of that stuff going away a little bit. But I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's kind of a '23 to '24, '24 to '25, we'd largely expect it to be this 60% fall through. We're going to have these quarter-to-quarter movements that kind of violate that, because of just one-off things. But I think in general, you'll see 60% fall through be the right measure. Longer term, we're obviously going to want to see that number go up, because it's going to drive us to the 60% gross margins. We ultimately want to attain. But in the near term, we're kind of dealing with a lot of the costs associated with five nodes in four years. It's just a lot of startup costs back. We'll probably hit our peak start-up cost in 2024. So that's a huge headwind we'll have to deal with. So that's going to, kind of keep us in this 60% fall through range for the next couple of years.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow- up question?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. I do, Dave. Yes. Just how you get to that 60%. So it seems like there could be persistent headwinds in terms of capacity utilization. I mean, I think a lot of us see that there's this plan to cut over to internal, starting with Panther Lake, but that doesn't really ramp into high volume until probably 2026. So are you managing to some sort of like utilization rate for your internal capacity to sort of get to that 60%? Thanks.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Well, maybe step back a little bit on the 60%. I mean, it will be driven by a number of factors, one of which is just revenue. Revenue growing on a largely fixed cost business is going to help gross margins. Obviously, we have optimism around how we can drive the growth of the business. The second, as you point out, is loadings. And we are managing our capital spend and our investment with an eye on loadings to make sure that we keep those in a good place. Obviously, last year, we had some underloadings to deal with. But as we kind of break out of that and start to move into the next year, I think we'll start to see some improvements there. Third, as we get, as Pat was talking about, to leadership in terms of nodes and products, ultimately across the entire product portfolio, that's going to help out on margins. It's going to help out from a cost structure perspective, but also better performing products are just going to yield better pricing and so forth, better profitability. And then lastly, we've got this internal foundry model that Pat mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we think is going to deliver tons of savings for the company. I think every week that Pat and I spend on this. Somebody brings up another big rock that they found of savings they can identify, because they were looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times and how many - and what sort of hot lots they do and how much sample activity they use. The factories now, as you point out, very, very hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investments associated with the loadings. So, we're way more focused in terms of steppings and so forth. So, I think we'll get, like I said in a call a couple of quarters ago, $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately. And so that's another big step function that I think gets us to the 60% gross margin.\nPat Gelsinger: I'd also add things like we just announced with UMC, right. We're taking older factories. And as Tim, as you might've heard me say in the past right, a bug in the Intel business model, right. Just when a factory got very good and depreciated, we moved to the next node. Well now, we're starting to fill that with long-term foundry business as well. So all of these are improving the discipline of running the business as well as how we utilize our factory networks long-term. And we really do think that the 60-40 is what Dave and I are driving the business to and we're going to get there.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the data center decline in Q1, how much of that is a function of the weakness in FPGAs that you've talked to already and then just any sense of what the cloud and server environment is like in the first quarter?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. So, overall, when you fact, obviously, we've spoken separately about the FPGA business. So, let's just move that to the side. Overall, I'll say it's fairly seasonal quarter-to-quarter in what we expect. That said, we're seeing strength from our server customers. For instance, more of the OEM responses are strong with regard to the momentum they're seeing in the enterprise server business. And obviously, our product line is improving there. We do expect year-on-year growth here. We see our market share stabilizing. And obviously, as we're ramping, Gen 4, Gen 5, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, the momentum is building for us overall. And as we indicated, hi, we think more of the AI surge is going to result in AI inferencing on-prem, which we're well positioned to be a beneficiary of. I would just cite that here we are in year 20 of the public cloud, and you have 60% plus of compute in the cloud, but 80 plus percent of data remains on-prem. Customers want to realize the value of that on-prem data with AI, and that's an enterprise strength for Intel. So, we do see all of these trends giving us a very favorable outlook for the year. And there's nothing surprising about the Q1 guide here. And we're going to be very focused on beating those numbers and building on the momentum of improving our product line.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up question?\nJoseph Moore: Yes, I do. Along the same lines, can you talk about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids? And I guess, how do you see the long-term mix between those? What kind of appetite do you see for the Sierra Forest and higher core count designs?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And I would love to talk for hours about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. I am super excited about those products, both of them on Intel 3. And if I build on the last question from Tim about factory loadings, hi, we are driving hard to accelerate those products into the marketplace, and they're really the drivers of Intel 3 capacity. The mix between them, obviously, this is our first, I'll say, volume mainstream offering for a high core count. I sort of view this as the cloud guys just one VMs at scale or just one containers at scale. That's what Sierra Forest is about, is sort of that bulk workload. And it doesn't have some of the performance capabilities, peak capabilities, feature capabilities that Granite Rapids has. I expect the bulk of the market to stay on Granite Rapids type products, the P-core products, certainly in '24 and '25. But we do see a pretty steady rise in the use of Sierra Forest. And then as we move to Clearwater Forest in '25, a very compelling product. We do see a pretty healthy split between those for the cloud and data center customers. I think most of the enterprise customers will stay with the P-core products that they will have. And it really is Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest, and successors being sort of that bulk mainstream cloud offering that's very focused on TCO. So with that, we feel super good about our product portfolio, P-cores, E-cores, really allowing us to stretch the offerings to the highest performance with high core count and to the best TCO. And with that, this is a portfolio that will allow us to regain share in the core data center market.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to revisit the gross margins, and I appreciate the 60% flow-through comment that we should use as a rule of thumb. But Dave, starting at 44.5% in the first quarter, how do you - are you still looking for the overall reported non-GAAP number to be up year-over-year from the 43.6%? And you mentioned some volatility there. I just want to clarify on the call how the gross margin trajectory is going to look year-over-year and understanding there's that volatility there? Thanks.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Yes, to be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on the 60% fall-through. So you should take the full year gross margins that we had in '23, which were roughly 43.5%. And think about this 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on quarter-to-quarter basis. And so, you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year. The only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it. So there could be quarters in which we get less ship through of previously reserved products. Sometimes it's more. And so and kind of avoiding trying to pinpoint every quarter, because of the difficulty around pinpointing that, but we feel very confident around the 60% fall-through.\nJohn Pitzer: Ben, do you have a follow-up?\nBen Reitzes: Yes, thanks, John. Could you talk a little bit more about the client market? There was - you mentioned that corporate, you said some strength and Dell had said there was some weakness. And heading into the first quarter, can you talk about the revenues on client and what makes you so confident that it's really going to pick up? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year was 270. This year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution of market share through last year. And the product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds, like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is, I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like, even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AIPC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect. And customers are starting to look at the post-COVID refreshes. So a lot of those benefits materialize as you go through the year. But our position in gaming, commercial, very strong for us overall. And I'll tell you, we're just seeing a lot of excitement for the AIPC. I describe this the Centrino moment. The most exciting category-defining moment since Wi-Fi was introduced two-plus decades ago. So, we do think that it's going to bring multi-year cycle of growth, great ISVs, great new use cases, and a product line that is clearly leading the industry established in this category.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arora from Bank of America Security. Your question, please?\nVivek Arora: Thanks for taking my question. But I'm curious, now that we are a year into the generative AI deployments, what's your view on how cloud customers are thinking about the CapEx between traditional and AI servers? Because when we look at the revenue growth across your GPU competitors, they seem to be capturing nearly all of the incremental CapEx and in some cases, even more than right, just the CapEx at the public cloud company. So does that really leave much room for your CPU business to grow right beyond just the seasonal variations? So just how are you looking at the AI market overall? And what part of that is Intel really able to capture when we just look at how much is being or needing to be dedicated to your GPU competitors?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And let's just maybe three different aspects to it. The first one is clearly the high end cloud guys and what they're doing for maximizing training environments. Clearly that's been an accelerator market so far. But that even is giving, I'll say a bit of a tailwind in the sense there are lots of head nodes associated with that. We do think, as we said, that the market moves much more from high end training to inferencing. Of where our product line is more substantive for it. But the enterprise market, as we see it for data centers, is very much going to be an on-premise play, taking advantage of inferencing in that data pools that they already have. And that's an area of good strength for Intel. And we're starting to see that in some of the conversations with our OEM customers. And as I finished, probably 50 meetings between World Economic Forum and Davos and CDS with customers, I'll say we have absolute unanimous response that they're going to be deploying a lot of their AI on premise in their data centers. And, you know, Xeons and our on premise offerings are simply the preferred way for them to be taken advantage of those capabilities inside of their data centers. Inside of the TCO envelopes, power, networking management that, they have in place. Obviously, we need to be participating - more in the accelerator piece of that. And we're seeing the growing pipeline of our opportunities. We saw a nice uptick in revenue in Q4 from a small number, but a lot of momentum as we come into the year. And Gaudi3 is getting a lot of excitement, you know, clearly leading in TCO. So, we're going to be competing much more for that high end accelerator footprint. But I think the message of 2024 is going to be inferencing, AI everywhere. That's going to be at the edge. That's going to be the AIPC. And it's going to be in the enterprise data center, all areas that Intel has a much stronger footprint.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up question?\nVivek Arora: Yes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Pat. So on the foundry side, I think you mentioned IFS, you know, some declines in Q1 after the strong Q4 that you had. So, I was hoping if you could just help us size what is IFS in Q1. And then longer term, you know, you mentioned now you have four 18A wins, but how do we quantify what they mean for '24 or '25 or '26? And I think on the call you had mentioned somewhere about $10 billion in lifetime wins. I'm hoping that that's what you meant for 18A. But when I look at that $10 billion over multiple years, that is not really that big relative to I think the $130 billion plus annual foundry market. So could you just help us size what does Intel's external foundry business mean for 2024 or 2025 perspective? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And the two things in the Q4 to Q1 numbers on IFS, one is the - I'll say the natural ending of our traditional packaging volume. So that affects Q4 as we go into Q1. And obviously our focus there isn't doing I'll say traditional packaging. You know, that's best supplied by OSAT vendors, but we were in a unique position to help our customers as we went through the COVID cycle. All of our packaging focus going forward, is advanced packaging where our technology is differentiated, the margins are good. And as you saw, we just announced the New Mexico facility, as the first major advanced manufacturing facility on U.S. soil. A lot of excitement from that from customers across the world. Also, we had our foundry equipment business, which was another factor Q4 to Q1, very consistent. With the profile that you might've heard from people like ASML, right? As they saw the quarter-to-quarter implications on the equipment business. So I'll say Q4 to Q1, all explainable in those contexts. The business we're winning 18A foundry customers, Intel 3 packaging, it takes quarters for that to materialize and for wafer customers' years. And that's why we said lifetime deal value is probably the best metric that we can give you to help you understand the nature of that business as it's growing. And as I said, we saw a big uptick from our prior update to this one. Obviously we need to, as your question suggests, get to a much bigger number. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We're now well underway. We're seeing healthy growth in lifetime deal value. We'll be giving you periodic updates on it as a good metric of seeing how rapidly that business is growing for us. And I've emphasized that number is just external foundry, right? Our internal business is what's going to be driving the factory build out. And that really gives us the scale to then start adding these additional external customers to it. Those deals, as we say, they could be a year or two, or they could be multiple years in length. There'll be a varying contract length associated with them. And we just want to give some visibility, transparency to the business and a rapidly growing lifetime deal value is a good way for us to give you some characterization of that business outlook. Finally, I want to see you on February 21. We're going to hold a big industry ecosystem event, our IFS direct connect and meeting with the ecosystem, our customers, but we're inviting analysts to listen in to the great conversations we're going to have and the disclosures that we'll be giving there.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Vivek. Jonathan, if you have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our final question for today. And our final question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'll combine both my questions into one. Typically, you know, in a manufacturing transition, you take on one, maybe two kinds of technical challenges. Here at 18A, you know, you're taking on backside power, gate all around and high in A. So, we'd love to hear kind of maybe some of the struggles you've seen, how you've worked through them, and what kind of feedback you're getting from customers in all three of those and kind of the confidence on delivering the goods in the timeline that we set out? Thank you.\nPat Gelsinger: Very good. So let me characterize a little bit more carefully, because we've been trying to carefully manage the risk that we're taking on. So first was the move into EUV. We began that with Intel 4 and Intel 3. And those, as we said, are high volume manufacturing underway done. So, we sort of took the risk of EUV off the table there. Backside power, right, we ran an internal node, something we didn't disclose to external foundry customers. But we ran, many, many wafers using Intel 3, with backside power to go de-risk backside power, before we put it into Intel 20A and Intel 18A. So, we had a major step to de-risk backside power. And then of course, gate all around the transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and the gate all around transistor. But I'll tell you, as we've been going through the development process. Backside power on 18A has been elegant, beautiful, high yield, very clean in its introduction into the process. And really the focus has been on the new transistor structure with gate all around. As customers are taking advantage of that now, as they're starting to look at that, they're really seeing great benefits from backside power. In some cases, almost as much performance benefit and significant area benefit from that. And gate all around transistors making good progress are 0.9 PDK that we delivered in Q4. And we'll be having the 1.0 PDK in Q2 on track. And as I said, Clearwater Forest is the first product. And it's now in fab on 18A, a huge milestone for us, both on the product side, as well as on the process side. High-NA, the next generation of EUV is not part of 18A, right? That will be part of the next major node. We'll talk more about that at the Intel Foundry Day, as we said on February 21, but we're not introducing that as a risk factor into 18A. You know, it's the EUV tools that are in production today that we've already de-risked as part of the Intel 4 and Intel 3. So, we think we've done a very careful management of risk. And we look at this all the time as we're rebuilding our momentum. And as I said, overall, we are confident five nodes in four years. This was audacious. It's been superbly executed, and we are on track to deliver it and get back to process, technology, leadership for both our products, as well as to establish a major foundry opportunity for the industry. Rebuilding Western supply chains, the momentum we're seeing in our whole factory network. You know, this is really incredible, the progress, and I couldn't be proud of our team for getting it done. So with that, you know, let me say thank you for joining us on the call as always. We appreciate the opportunity that we have to update you on a strong Q4, beating on top and bottom line, finishing an incredible year in 2023. And we're just excited about the momentum we see across the business for both our products, our business and financial execution, the manufacturing technology, foundry design wins really across the board. Our say-do ratio has been extremely high, and we appreciate the interest. And as I said, we look forward to the opportunity to give you some more updates as part of Foundry Direct Connect, February 21 in San Jose. And I hope to see many of you there as we lay out an exciting update to the industry, and it'll be a great day for us. Thank you so much for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was the culmination of a year of tremendous progress towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. We consistently executed on our plan to reestablish process leadership, further build out our capacity and foundry plans, greatly improved product execution and began to execute on our mission to bring AI everywhere across our product segments. We delivered solid Q4 results exceeding expectations for the fourth quarter in a row. Revenue was at the higher end of our guidance, and we had strong EPS upside as a result of our ongoing relentless focus on driving operating leverage and expense management, including comfortably meeting our $3 billion cost savings commitment for fiscal year '23. 2023 was definitely a year when we did what we said we would do and more. We intend to make 2024 another such year. And when we look out over the next 12 months, we are confident that we can continue to drive considerable progress on our IDM 2.0 journey. As we look into Q1, our core business, including client server and edge products continues to perform well and is tracking to the lower end of seasonal. However, discrete headwinds, including Mobileye, PSG and business exits, among others, are impacting overall revenue, leading to a lower Q1 guide. Importantly, we see this as temporary, and we expect sequential and year-on-year growth in both revenue and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year '24. Momentum and excitement around new products and businesses remain strong as we head into the year and will grow stronger as the year progresses. We could not be prouder of the execution across our process technology roadmap in 2023 and we became the world's first high-volume manufacturer of logic devices using EUV, both the U.S. and Europe as we aggressively ramped Core Ultra on Intel 4 in both Oregon and Ireland. Intel 3 achieved manufacturing readiness in Q4 as committed with solid performance in year progression. Our two lead vehicles in Intel 3 are on track, and we look forward to launching Sierra Forest in first half '24 followed shortly thereafter by Granite Rapids. Sierra Forest has final samples at customers and the production stepping of Granite Rapids is running ahead of schedule well into power-on validation and very healthy. We are even more excited about breaking into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, the latter unexpected two years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half '24, completing our five nodes in four year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into Fab shortly. As we complete our goal of five nodes in four years, we are not satisfied nor are we finished. We have begun installation of the industry's first high NA EUV tool in our most advanced technology development site in Oregon aimed at addressing challenges beyond 18A. We remain focused on being good stewards of Moore's Law and ensuring a continuous node migration path over the next decade and beyond. Third-party engagements with IFS continue to validate our progress on process technology. We launched IFS with a long-term view of delivering the world's first system foundry that brings together a secure and sustainable supply chain with the best of Intel and our ecosystem. While our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year '23 towards our goal of becoming the second largest external foundry by 2030. The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP is now one of the largest, fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market. We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA design services, IP, cloud and U.S. military aerospace and government. Critical agreements with ARM and Synopsys continue to gain momentum. We delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States Government and Department of Defense. We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile, communication infrastructure and networking. This expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site. Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed the Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the 3 Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and U.S. capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four inclusive of a meaningful prepay and our momentum continues to grow. Our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another important advantage for IFS, a faster on-ramp to broader foundry relationships. During the quarter, we captured three additional advanced packaging design wins, bringing the total to five in 2023, with the majority of revenue starting in 2025. To support our growing demand, just yesterday, we opened Fab 9 in New Mexico, marking a milestone for high-volume 3D advanced packaging manufacturing. The momentum in advanced packaging is very strong and is another facet of our foundry strategy, which is clearly benefiting from the surge of interest in AI. With leadership technology and available capacity, our opportunity set continues to grow. In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, our lifetime deal value for IFS is now over $10 billion, more than doubling from the $4 billion we provided in our last update. Supporting our growing momentum in IFS is our global manufacturing footprint we are the only semiconductor company with that scale and sustainable manufacturing in every major region of the world providing ourselves and our foundry customers resilient access to the right capacity in the right regions at the right time. All of our expansion projects in the U.S., EU and Asia are progressing on schedule, and our chips applications in the U.S. and EU are progressing well. Finally, we are thrilled to be hosting our first Foundry Day, IFS Direct Connect on February 21 in San Jose where we will have the opportunity to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem as well as begin to talk about our process roadmap beyond Intel 18A, next-generation packaging and our full foundry vision. We hope to see many of you there. Intel continues its mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. And given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic. We have already discussed how our 50-year heritage and high-performance computing transistors and our advanced packaging positions IFS to benefit from the accelerating move to AI. Within our product portfolio, we are the only company with the products, IP and ecosystem reach to empower customers to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications from the cloud through the network, into the enterprise client and edge. For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive ML perf benchmarks and leadership TCO. As AI proliferates and the world moves towards more AI integrated application, there's a market shift toward local inferencing and smaller, more nimble models. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inferencing cost and round trip latency. With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra ushering in the AI PC era and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of clients and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than requiring it in the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. In Q4, our server business experienced solid sequential growth, consistent with market share, which we believe was flat with Q3 levels. Since launching 4th Gen Xeon in early 2023, we have shipped more than 2.5 million units with approximately 1/3 of all 4th Gen demand driven by AI. With our 5th Gen Xeon launch, we enable up to 42% higher AI inference performance compared to the industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. 5th Gen Xeon has reached general availability at Alibaba is entering public and private previews with several CSPs and is on track to ship with OEMs next month. More importantly, our improved execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon ramping well, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids coming soon and Clearwater Forest already going into the fab. Momentum is building and positioning us well to win back share in the data center. Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs. In a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing. We're building on this momentum with Gaudi 3, which is on track to launch this year and is expected to deliver performance leadership with 4x the processing power and double the networking bandwidth for greater scale out performance. Gaudi 3 is now in the lab, powered on and showing great health and performance and Falcon Shores is also well underway. Our accelerator pipeline for 2024 grew double digits sequentially in Q4 and is now well above $2 billion and growing. We recently increased our supply for both Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 to support the growing customer demand and we expect meaningful revenue acceleration throughout the year. As we announced last quarter, we are now operating PSG as a standalone business beginning on January 1. Our intent is to bring in private capital this year to create an eventual path to an IPO over the coming years. As we outlined on our Q3 call, PSG is in the midst of an industry-wide cyclical correction for FPGAs, which we expect to last through the first half of '24. Despite the financial correction, operational momentum is strong and PSG executed its most ambitious FPGA roadmap, delivering 21 new product releases in 2023 and executing supply assurance agreements valued by our customers. Finally, even as we congratulate Sandra Rivera, the new CEO of PSG, I am extremely pleased to welcome Justin Hotard as Executive Vice President and General Manager of DCAI. Justin joined us from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he was Executive Vice President and General Manager of High Performance Computing AI and Labs. He will play a key role in helping customers accelerate their businesses with our Xeon processor family, delivering on our commitments to customers and partners by increasing our GPU and accelerator footprint and supporting our mission to bring AI everywhere. Moving to client. CCG performed very well in Q4, posting the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. Demand reflected a normalized inventory environment of sustained strength in gaming and commercial with our highest end SKUs exceeding Q3 records by 20%. The 2023 consumption TAM was roughly 270 million units consistent with our views entering the year, and we expect the PC TAM up low single digits year-on-year in 2024, in line with third-party estimates. Our share position is strong, and our product portfolio for 2024 and beyond and ecosystem work will continue to drive industry-leading performance and experiences. In Q4, we ushered in the age of the AI PC with the launch of Intel Core Ultra. Representing our largest architectural shift in decades, the Core Ultra is the most AI-capable and power-efficient client processor with dedicated acceleration capabilities across the CPU, GPU and Neural Processing Unit or NPU. Ultra is the centerpiece of the AI PC, systems that are capable of natively running popular $10 billion parameter models and drive superior performance on key AI-enhanced applications like Zoom, Adobe and Microsoft. We expect to ship approximately 40 million AI PCs in 2024 alone with more than 230 designs from ultrathin PCs to handheld gaming devices to be delivered this year from OEM partners, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, MSI, Samsung Electronics and others. The Core Ultra platform delivers leadership AI performance today with our next-generation platforms launching later this year, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake tripling our AI performance. In 2025 with Panther Lake, we will grow AI performance up to an additional 2x. NEX is well positioned to benefit from the proliferation of AI workloads on the edge where our market-leading hardware and software assets provides improved latency, reliability and cost. OpenVINO adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4 and today is a core software layer for AI inferencing on the edge, on the PC and in the data center. NEX is also driving the shift of AI networking in the cloud from proprietary technologies to open Ethernet-based approaches in partnership with a broader industry ecosystem. NEX Q4 results beat our internal forecast and the division is poised for solid growth in 2024 across edge network and ethnic products more skewed to the second half. Yet another growing market opportunity for us is automotive. While Mobileye is experiencing a sharp inventory correction in Q1, we are encouraged by their improving forecast throughout 2024 and more importantly, the recent announcement at CES that they were awarded a series of production design wins by a major Western automaker across the company's three key platforms: SuperVision, Chauffeur and Drive. In addition to Mobileye's strengths in AV, at CES, we announced the launch of AI-enhanced software-defined vehicle, SoCs with Geely's Zeekr brand as our first OEM partner and our agreement to acquire Silicon Mobility, a fabulous silicon and software company specializing in power management SoCs focused on EVs. These announcements build on shared IP across clients and data center and our existing Intel SoC footprint of more than 50 million vehicles worldwide. Our strategy will continue to broaden our exposure to the growing auto market on both the product and the foundry sides of our business. Finally, underpinning our across-the-board progress in 2023 is our operational and financial discipline. As our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency, accountability and focus on cost begins to take root, we expect to unlock further cost savings and efficiencies in 2024 and beyond. We have officially transitioned to this new operating model on January 1, and we'll report the new segmentation format as part of our Q1 earnings. We see incremental efficiencies as we drive to our long-term model of 60% gross and 40% operating margins. As I reflect on our progress in 2023, I am incredibly proud of our employees whose commitment and perseverance were instrumental to the execution of our ambitious strategy. Together, we exited the year accomplishing exactly what we set out to do. We improved our execution engine consistently being on track or ahead on our process and product roadmap. And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are confident in our performance and financial trajectory for the year ahead. We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate. We will maintain our relentless focus on our mission and commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn things over to David. Yes. Hi, thanks, Ross. I'll start and ask Dave to follow-up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1? There's a wide range of perspectives, anywhere from 3% to 20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement, of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built the forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast, but the core business we see is healthy. For it, we see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger. So, we'll say it really reflects as we view the market, but we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, like improving on revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year. And we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. And obviously, as the year improves, new product lines are merging, tailwinds in areas like AIPC, Gaudi ramping for accelerators. Overall, a lot of things just keep improving as we go through the year. Combined with good cost discipline, we feel quite comfortable that we're starting strong and we're going to have an improving year as the year progresses. Yes, thank you. I'll do that and ask Dave for pile on both of those a little bit. But with respect to the manufacturing, I'll just say, hey, we look at this every single day and we're scrutinizing carefully our progress on 18A. And obviously the great news that we just described those Clearwater Forest taping out, that gives us a lot of confidence that 18A is healthy. That's a major product for us. Panther Lake following that shortly. We've also had our fourth customer this quarter. Some of the IP providers are giving us very strong affirmation on the competitiveness of the process technology. And particularly, we're just way ahead on backside power. And that's not even, everybody in the industry is recognizing that. And many of the customers who are looking at it are seeing substantial gains, not just in power performance, but in area savings as well. So overall, we feel very confident that our roadmap is strong in the process technology side. We do use external foundries and obviously that grew as we were dealing with some of our own challenges for process competitiveness. And as we create more and more focus in the business, more wafers will come in internal to the Intel factory network. But long-term, we're going to continue to use external foundries to complement, manage our capital requirements. And to make sure that our teams always are building the best products in the industry and using the best technologies to accomplish that. So overall, we feel super good with our strategy. You'll see more use of our own factory network, even as we leverage external foundries where appropriate. I'd also add things like we just announced with UMC, right. We're taking older factories. And as Tim, as you might've heard me say in the past right, a bug in the Intel business model, right. Just when a factory got very good and depreciated, we moved to the next node. Well now, we're starting to fill that with long-term foundry business as well. So all of these are improving the discipline of running the business as well as how we utilize our factory networks long-term. And we really do think that the 60-40 is what Dave and I are driving the business to and we're going to get there. Yes. So, overall, when you fact, obviously, we've spoken separately about the FPGA business. So, let's just move that to the side. Overall, I'll say it's fairly seasonal quarter-to-quarter in what we expect. That said, we're seeing strength from our server customers. For instance, more of the OEM responses are strong with regard to the momentum they're seeing in the enterprise server business. And obviously, our product line is improving there. We do expect year-on-year growth here. We see our market share stabilizing. And obviously, as we're ramping, Gen 4, Gen 5, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, the momentum is building for us overall. And as we indicated, hi, we think more of the AI surge is going to result in AI inferencing on-prem, which we're well positioned to be a beneficiary of. I would just cite that here we are in year 20 of the public cloud, and you have 60% plus of compute in the cloud, but 80 plus percent of data remains on-prem. Customers want to realize the value of that on-prem data with AI, and that's an enterprise strength for Intel. So, we do see all of these trends giving us a very favorable outlook for the year. And there's nothing surprising about the Q1 guide here. And we're going to be very focused on beating those numbers and building on the momentum of improving our product line. Yes, thank you. And I would love to talk for hours about Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. I am super excited about those products, both of them on Intel 3. And if I build on the last question from Tim about factory loadings, hi, we are driving hard to accelerate those products into the marketplace, and they're really the drivers of Intel 3 capacity. The mix between them, obviously, this is our first, I'll say, volume mainstream offering for a high core count. I sort of view this as the cloud guys just one VMs at scale or just one containers at scale. That's what Sierra Forest is about, is sort of that bulk workload. And it doesn't have some of the performance capabilities, peak capabilities, feature capabilities that Granite Rapids has. I expect the bulk of the market to stay on Granite Rapids type products, the P-core products, certainly in '24 and '25. But we do see a pretty steady rise in the use of Sierra Forest. And then as we move to Clearwater Forest in '25, a very compelling product. We do see a pretty healthy split between those for the cloud and data center customers. I think most of the enterprise customers will stay with the P-core products that they will have. And it really is Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest, and successors being sort of that bulk mainstream cloud offering that's very focused on TCO. So with that, we feel super good about our product portfolio, P-cores, E-cores, really allowing us to stretch the offerings to the highest performance with high core count and to the best TCO. And with that, this is a portfolio that will allow us to regain share in the core data center market. Yes. So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year was 270. This year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution of market share through last year. And the product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds, like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is, I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like, even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AIPC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect. And customers are starting to look at the post-COVID refreshes. So a lot of those benefits materialize as you go through the year. But our position in gaming, commercial, very strong for us overall. And I'll tell you, we're just seeing a lot of excitement for the AIPC. I describe this the Centrino moment. The most exciting category-defining moment since Wi-Fi was introduced two-plus decades ago. So, we do think that it's going to bring multi-year cycle of growth, great ISVs, great new use cases, and a product line that is clearly leading the industry established in this category. Yes, thank you. And let's just maybe three different aspects to it. The first one is clearly the high end cloud guys and what they're doing for maximizing training environments. Clearly that's been an accelerator market so far. But that even is giving, I'll say a bit of a tailwind in the sense there are lots of head nodes associated with that. We do think, as we said, that the market moves much more from high end training to inferencing. Of where our product line is more substantive for it. But the enterprise market, as we see it for data centers, is very much going to be an on-premise play, taking advantage of inferencing in that data pools that they already have. And that's an area of good strength for Intel. And we're starting to see that in some of the conversations with our OEM customers. And as I finished, probably 50 meetings between World Economic Forum and Davos and CDS with customers, I'll say we have absolute unanimous response that they're going to be deploying a lot of their AI on premise in their data centers. And, you know, Xeons and our on premise offerings are simply the preferred way for them to be taken advantage of those capabilities inside of their data centers. Inside of the TCO envelopes, power, networking management that, they have in place. Obviously, we need to be participating - more in the accelerator piece of that. And we're seeing the growing pipeline of our opportunities. We saw a nice uptick in revenue in Q4 from a small number, but a lot of momentum as we come into the year. And Gaudi3 is getting a lot of excitement, you know, clearly leading in TCO. So, we're going to be competing much more for that high end accelerator footprint. But I think the message of 2024 is going to be inferencing, AI everywhere. That's going to be at the edge. That's going to be the AIPC. And it's going to be in the enterprise data center, all areas that Intel has a much stronger footprint. Yes. And the two things in the Q4 to Q1 numbers on IFS, one is the - I'll say the natural ending of our traditional packaging volume. So that affects Q4 as we go into Q1. And obviously our focus there isn't doing I'll say traditional packaging. You know, that's best supplied by OSAT vendors, but we were in a unique position to help our customers as we went through the COVID cycle. All of our packaging focus going forward, is advanced packaging where our technology is differentiated, the margins are good. And as you saw, we just announced the New Mexico facility, as the first major advanced manufacturing facility on U.S. soil. A lot of excitement from that from customers across the world. Also, we had our foundry equipment business, which was another factor Q4 to Q1, very consistent. With the profile that you might've heard from people like ASML, right? As they saw the quarter-to-quarter implications on the equipment business. So I'll say Q4 to Q1, all explainable in those contexts. The business we're winning 18A foundry customers, Intel 3 packaging, it takes quarters for that to materialize and for wafer customers' years. And that's why we said lifetime deal value is probably the best metric that we can give you to help you understand the nature of that business as it's growing. And as I said, we saw a big uptick from our prior update to this one. Obviously we need to, as your question suggests, get to a much bigger number. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We're now well underway. We're seeing healthy growth in lifetime deal value. We'll be giving you periodic updates on it as a good metric of seeing how rapidly that business is growing for us. And I've emphasized that number is just external foundry, right? Our internal business is what's going to be driving the factory build out. And that really gives us the scale to then start adding these additional external customers to it. Those deals, as we say, they could be a year or two, or they could be multiple years in length. There'll be a varying contract length associated with them. And we just want to give some visibility, transparency to the business and a rapidly growing lifetime deal value is a good way for us to give you some characterization of that business outlook. Finally, I want to see you on February 21. We're going to hold a big industry ecosystem event, our IFS direct connect and meeting with the ecosystem, our customers, but we're inviting analysts to listen in to the great conversations we're going to have and the disclosures that we'll be giving there. Very good. So let me characterize a little bit more carefully, because we've been trying to carefully manage the risk that we're taking on. So first was the move into EUV. We began that with Intel 4 and Intel 3. And those, as we said, are high volume manufacturing underway done. So, we sort of took the risk of EUV off the table there. Backside power, right, we ran an internal node, something we didn't disclose to external foundry customers. But we ran, many, many wafers using Intel 3, with backside power to go de-risk backside power, before we put it into Intel 20A and Intel 18A. So, we had a major step to de-risk backside power. And then of course, gate all around the transistor. So 18A brings those two together, backside power and the gate all around transistor. But I'll tell you, as we've been going through the development process. Backside power on 18A has been elegant, beautiful, high yield, very clean in its introduction into the process. And really the focus has been on the new transistor structure with gate all around. As customers are taking advantage of that now, as they're starting to look at that, they're really seeing great benefits from backside power. In some cases, almost as much performance benefit and significant area benefit from that. And gate all around transistors making good progress are 0.9 PDK that we delivered in Q4. And we'll be having the 1.0 PDK in Q2 on track. And as I said, Clearwater Forest is the first product. And it's now in fab on 18A, a huge milestone for us, both on the product side, as well as on the process side. High-NA, the next generation of EUV is not part of 18A, right? That will be part of the next major node. We'll talk more about that at the Intel Foundry Day, as we said on February 21, but we're not introducing that as a risk factor into 18A. You know, it's the EUV tools that are in production today that we've already de-risked as part of the Intel 4 and Intel 3. So, we think we've done a very careful management of risk. And we look at this all the time as we're rebuilding our momentum. And as I said, overall, we are confident five nodes in four years. This was audacious. It's been superbly executed, and we are on track to deliver it and get back to process, technology, leadership for both our products, as well as to establish a major foundry opportunity for the industry. Rebuilding Western supply chains, the momentum we're seeing in our whole factory network. You know, this is really incredible, the progress, and I couldn't be proud of our team for getting it done. So with that, you know, let me say thank you for joining us on the call as always. We appreciate the opportunity that we have to update you on a strong Q4, beating on top and bottom line, finishing an incredible year in 2023. And we're just excited about the momentum we see across the business for both our products, our business and financial execution, the manufacturing technology, foundry design wins really across the board. Our say-do ratio has been extremely high, and we appreciate the interest. And as I said, we look forward to the opportunity to give you some more updates as part of Foundry Direct Connect, February 21 in San Jose. And I hope to see many of you there as we lay out an exciting update to the industry, and it'll be a great day for us. Thank you so much for joining us."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial results in the quarter on top of continued execution of our products and process roadmap commitments. We again beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. We've taken proactive steps to prioritize our investments, aggressively manage near-term expenses and made meaningful progress on reducing our structural cost gaps. We exit 2023 a healthier and leaner company, but there is much more work to do in 2024 and beyond to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and the potential of IDM 2.0. Fourth quarter revenue was $15.4 billion, up 9% sequentially, 10% year-over-year and $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance with solid execution across reported segments. Gross margin was 48.8%, 230 basis points better than our guidance, driven by favorable product mix and ASPs, improved unit costs and higher revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.54, beating guidance by $0.10 on improved gross margins, stronger revenue and disciplined OpEx management. Q4 operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Net inventory was down more than $300 million and nine days in the quarter, and DSO remains under 20. Net CapEx was $5.9 billion resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.3 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Moving to the fourth quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, up 12% sequentially, 33% year-over-year and ahead of internal expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter. We saw sustained strength in gaming and commercial segments, along with record performance notebook shipments in the quarter. Customer inventory levels have normalized and 2023 PC consumption was in line with our 270 million unit forecast. Operating profit was $2.9 billion, up more than $800 million sequentially and nearly $2.4 billion year-over-year on improved TAM and market share and sell-through of reserved inventory. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, up 4% sequentially. The server business delivered double-digit growth sequentially, partially offset by the FPGA inventory correction. Revenue was driven by improved unit TAM, stable share and rising average core density contributing to record Xeon ASPs. Operating profit was $78 million, roughly flat sequentially as advanced node development costs continue to weigh on profitability. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 1% sequentially and ahead of internal expectations on strength from network and Ethernet segments. The business saw an operating loss of $12 million, down modestly quarter-over-quarter. Intel Foundry Services contributed revenue of $291 million, down modestly on a sequential basis and up 63% year-over-year on increased traditional packaging revenue. IFS operating loss was $113 million, driven by continued investment to develop and grow world-class systems foundry. Mobileye delivered record revenue of $637 million, up 20% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, along with record operating profit of $242 million, up 42% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Recently disclosed design wins are expected to contribute more than $7 billion of future revenue or more than 3.5x Mobileye's record FY '23 revenue. As Pat summarized, the company made significant progress towards our IDM 2.0 strategy including strong execution against our 2023 financial commitments despite macro headwinds throughout the year. As committed at our Q1 '23 earnings call, we delivered revenue gross margin, operating margin and EPS growth each quarter. Despite significant investments in future growth and continued progression through five nodes in four years, we achieved our 2023 commitment of $3 billion of spending reductions. Through a strong focus on cash and cost controls, we achieved excellent DSO and DPO in the second half of 2023, and delivered net inventory reductions of nearly $2 billion and 35 days from our peak in Q1 '23. Working capital initiatives yielded roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023, helping us to meet our commitment for roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow in the second half of the year. We remain committed to our smart capital framework with growing contributions from our Skip agreement with Brookfield and progress toward government incentives in the U.S., Europe and Israel. In Q4, we also recognized $845 million of advanced manufacturing investment credits or AMIC, as defined in the CHIPS Act. While our continued IDM 2.0 capital investments will result in increased gross CapEx in '24 as compared to '23, we're on track to our aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of net CapEx spending in the mid-30s as a percent of revenue, with offsets towards the high end of the 20% to 30% range. Now turning to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion. At the Q1 revenue midpoint of $12.7 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 44.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.13. While we expect a slightly subseasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG. Additionally, we expect a significant drop in IFS revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment buying in the first half of the year, impacting the IMS business. When combined with businesses we exited in 2023, we expect a roughly $1 billion sequential revenue impact from businesses outside of our core products. With market signals remaining positive for PC demand and usage rates, we expect TAM to grow in the low single digits in 2024, consistent with third-party views. Our recent results show the PC remains essential, and we remain confident in our longer-term TAM forecast as the age of the AI PC further enhances the value of device refresh. We expect Q1 data center revenue to decline double-digit percent sequentially before improving through the year. While the data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio with well over $2 billion in pipeline to gain traction as we move through 2024. Within NEX, telco markets are likely to remain weak through the year, though we expect solid growth from our Network, FNIC and Edge products. These signals give us confidence that consolidated revenue will grow beyond typical seasonality after a soft Q1. And that we can deliver sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and EPS each quarter of 2024. We're confident we can grow earnings faster than revenue this year and maintain roughly breakeven adjusted free cash flow, though I'll remind you that the rapid pace of delivering five nodes in four years and capacity expansion in support of external foundry commitments remain headwinds on the pace of our margin expansion. We expect depreciation to grow by approximately $2 billion in 2024, in addition to a significant increase in variable factory start-up costs. 60% gross margin flow-through as a percent of revenue growth remains a rule of thumb in aggregate in the intermediate term, though we may see volatility in our quarterly gross margin results. We're excited to mark the first month fully operating under our new internal foundry reporting structure with improved accountability, transparency around cost and value drivers and increased focus on driving higher rates of return for our owner's capital. We intend to provide you with the recast historical financials this quarter in the form of an 8-K. We will unpack the details at that time, but you will see not only the first view of our manufacturing P&L, but a view of our products group more in line with external peers. While come as no surprise, our manufacturing P&L is under significant pressure as we get back to process leadership and build the infrastructure to meet both internal and external demand, we see abundant opportunity to drive improvement. Finally, standing up a separate legal entity for manufacturing, technology development and IFS is important to our foundry customers. We expect to have that structure in place in the second half of 2024. As we look back at 2023, we have a lot to be proud of. We entered the year with a challenging macro backdrop. I'm pleased with our team's efforts, controlling spending, ramping new products, managing share, executing product and process roadmaps and delivering for our customers. We continue to focus our portfolio by exiting five businesses in 2023 for a total of 10 since past return. While also identifying profitable adjacent markets, we can serve with our existing IP as we have done with Intel Auto. We executed within our Smart capital framework and are beginning to see meaningful capital offsets. We unlocked value for our shareholders through Mobileye and IMS and announced our intention to pursue external investments in PSG. I'd like to thank the entire Intel team for the hard work and execution, which drove our improved 2023 results. While we aren't yet where we want to be from a financial perspective, we're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market and with the strong foundation of financial discipline we set in 2023, we're confident and committed to our long-term financial objectives. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. And what's the long-term question, Ross? The only other thing I'd add is, just the use of external foundries as part of our smart capital strategy. It's one of the five pillars. So as Pat said, that will continue to be part of our strategy. Obviously, we're going to maximize how much we can do internally, but we're always going to be using external foundries based on smart capital. Yes. I mean - what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall through is probably the best rule of thumb. That said, as you know, quarter-to-quarter, things can move that number up and down. In Q4, we saw a better fall through. Largely, it was related to a better sell through of previously reserved product. We also actually did better on the factory side in terms of spending and yield. And so that also benefited us to some extent. And then in Q1, I think we're going to do a little worse. We're going to see the fall through be a little harder on us. And largely, that's some of that stuff going away a little bit. But I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's kind of a '23 to '24, '24 to '25, we'd largely expect it to be this 60% fall through. We're going to have these quarter-to-quarter movements that kind of violate that, because of just one-off things. But I think in general, you'll see 60% fall through be the right measure. Longer term, we're obviously going to want to see that number go up, because it's going to drive us to the 60% gross margins. We ultimately want to attain. But in the near term, we're kind of dealing with a lot of the costs associated with five nodes in four years. It's just a lot of startup costs back. We'll probably hit our peak start-up cost in 2024. So that's a huge headwind we'll have to deal with. So that's going to, kind of keep us in this 60% fall through range for the next couple of years. Yes. Well, maybe step back a little bit on the 60%. I mean, it will be driven by a number of factors, one of which is just revenue. Revenue growing on a largely fixed cost business is going to help gross margins. Obviously, we have optimism around how we can drive the growth of the business. The second, as you point out, is loadings. And we are managing our capital spend and our investment with an eye on loadings to make sure that we keep those in a good place. Obviously, last year, we had some underloadings to deal with. But as we kind of break out of that and start to move into the next year, I think we'll start to see some improvements there. Third, as we get, as Pat was talking about, to leadership in terms of nodes and products, ultimately across the entire product portfolio, that's going to help out on margins. It's going to help out from a cost structure perspective, but also better performing products are just going to yield better pricing and so forth, better profitability. And then lastly, we've got this internal foundry model that Pat mentioned, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we think is going to deliver tons of savings for the company. I think every week that Pat and I spend on this. Somebody brings up another big rock that they found of savings they can identify, because they were looking at the business in an entirely different way than they're used to looking at it. The product groups are now hyper-focused on test times and how many - and what sort of hot lots they do and how much sample activity they use. The factories now, as you point out, very, very hyper-focused on loadings and making sure they're properly thinking about their capital investments associated with the loadings. So, we're way more focused in terms of steppings and so forth. So, I think we'll get, like I said in a call a couple of quarters ago, $4 billion to $5 billion of savings from this internal foundry model ultimately. And so that's another big step function that I think gets us to the 60% gross margin. Yes. Yes, to be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on the 60% fall-through. So you should take the full year gross margins that we had in '23, which were roughly 43.5%. And think about this 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on quarter-to-quarter basis. And so, you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year. The only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it. So there could be quarters in which we get less ship through of previously reserved products. Sometimes it's more. And so and kind of avoiding trying to pinpoint every quarter, because of the difficulty around pinpointing that, but we feel very confident around the 60% fall-through."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today\u2019s discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our discussion also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations, where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, given our significant and now almost 50-year presence in Israel, we are deeply saddened by the recent attacks and their impact on the region. Our utmost priority is the safety and welfare of our people in Israel and their families. But I also want to recognize the resilience of our teams as they have kept our operations running and our factory expansion progressing. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the war, and I am praying for a swift return to peace. Turning to our results, we delivered an outstanding Q3, beating expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was above the high-end of our guidance and EPS benefited from both strong operating leverage and expense discipline. More important than our standout financial performance were the key operational milestones we achieved in the quarter across process and products, Intel Foundry Services, and our strategy to bring AI everywhere. Simply put, this quarter demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. The foundation of our strategy is reestablishing transistor power and performance leadership. While many thought our ambitions were a bit audacious when we began our five nodes and four-year journey roughly 2.5-years ago, we have increasing line of sight towards achieving our goal. Intel 7 is done with nearly 150 million units in aggregate of Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids already in the market. In addition, Emerald Rapids has achieved product release and began shipping this month. In Q3, we began initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4, which we are now aggressively ramping on the most productive fleet of EUV tools in the industry, providing us with a greater than 20% capital efficiency advantage, compared to when EUV tools were first launched. High volume EUV manufacturing is well underway in Oregon and more recently in Ireland. Our FAB 34 in Ireland represents the first high volume EUV production in Europe, underscoring our commitment to establish geographically diverse and resilient supply. We are the only leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer at scale in every major region of the globe. Our Intel 3 process is tracking to be manufacturing ready by year-end, supporting our first two Intel 3 products, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. In fact, our production stepping of Sierra Forest is already out of fab, and what we expect to be the production stepping of Granite Rapids has already taped in and is in the fab now. We are particularly excited by our move into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. Adding to our accelerating adoption of EUV are two key new innovations, RibbonFET and PowerVIA, representing the first fundamental change to the transistor and process architecture since we commercialized FinFET in 2012. I have been studying SEM diagrams for almost 40-years. RibbonFET and PowerVIA are true works of art, the most exquisite transistors ever created. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness on Intel 20A in the first-half of 2024. Arrow Lake, our lead product on 20A, is already running Windows and demonstrating excellent functionality. Even more significant, we hit a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the 0.9 release of the PDK with imminent availability to external customers. In simple terms, the invention phase of RibbonFET and PowerVIA is now complete, and we are racing towards production-ready, industry-leading process technology. Our first products on Intel 18A will go into fab on schedule in Q1 \u201824 with Clearwater Forest for servers, Panther Lake for clients, and of course a growing number of IFS test chips. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness for Intel 18A in second-half 24, completing our incredible five nodes and four years journey on or ahead of schedule. While Intel 18A reestablishes transistor leadership, we are racing to increase that lead. We announced that innovation are plans to lead the industry in a move to glass substrate for high density, performance, and unique optical capabilities. We also announced our plans to begin installation of the world's first high NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year to continue our modernizations and infrastructure expansions of our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon, home of our technology development team. Moore's Law continues to be the foundational driver of semiconductor technology and economics, which, in turn, fuels broader innovation in every industry across the globe. We remain committed to be good stewards of Moore's Law and drive advancements until we have exhausted every element on the periodic table. Importantly, our progress on process technology is now being well validated by third parties. We have made great progress with early IFS customers this quarter, which we expect to only accelerate with the release of the 0.9 PDK for Intel 18A. A major customer committed to Intel 18A and Intel 3, which includes a meaningful prepayment that expedites and expands our capacity corridor for this customer. The customer is seeing particularly good power, performance and area efficiency in their design. This opportunity is very significant and highlights our full system's foundry capabilities and high-performance computing, big die designs, leadership performance and area efficient transistors, advanced packaging and systems expertise. In addition, we are extremely pleased to announce today that we have signed with two additional 18A customers. Both are particularly focused in areas of high-performance compute and benefiting from power performance per unit silicon area. We have also made substantial progress with our next major customer and are expecting to conclude commercial contract negotiations before year-end. Finally, we were also very happy to expand our growing foundry ecosystem by completing our strategic partnership with Synopsys in Q3 to include IP for Intel 3 and Intel 18A for both Intel internal and external foundry customers. With the rise of AI and high-performance computing applications, our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another unique advantage. We have seen a surge of interest in our advanced packaging from most leading AI chip companies. With capacity corridors quickly available, this is proving to be a significant accelerant and on-ramp for Intel foundry customers. During the quarter, we were awarded two customer AI designs for our advanced packaging and with an additional six customers in active negotiations, we expect several more awards by year-end. We have also established an important business relationship with Tower Semiconductor, utilizing our manufacturing assets in New Mexico, along with Tower investing capital expenditures of roughly $300 million for its use in this facility. This represents an important step in our foundry strategy, improving cash flows by utilizing our manufacturing assets over a significantly longer period of time. Finally, we have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, representing over $100 billion of U.S. manufacturing and research investments to the CHIPS Program Office and are working closely with them as they review these proposals. We look forward to providing a deeper update on our foundry business during our planned IFS industry event in Q1 of 2024. We are on a mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. We are empowering the market to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications. For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks and a very cost-efficient TCO. However, as the world moves towards more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift towards local inferencing. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost. With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra launching the AIPC generation and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than forcing it into the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. The AI continuum enables AI everywhere. DCAI exceeded our forecast this quarter with server revenue up modestly sequentially. We continue to see a strong ramp of our 4th Gen Xeon processor with the world's top 10 CSPs now in general availability and improving strength from MNCs. During the quarter, we shipped our 1 millionth 4th Gen Xeon unit and are on track to surpass 2 million units next month. 4th Gen Xeon includes powerful accelerators, demonstrating best-in-class CPU performance for AI, security and networking workloads. Our AI-enhanced Xeons are primed for model inferencing, enabling seamless infusion of AI into existing workloads. This was visible this quarter with over one-third of 4th Gen Xeon shipments directly related to AI applications. We are the clear leader in AI CPU results as seen in MLCommons benchmarks today, and our road map provides significant further improvements with Granite Rapids expected to deliver an additional 2 times to 3 times AI performance on top of our industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. We continue to make excellent progress with our Xeon road map. Our 5th Gen Xeon processor code-named Emerald Rapids is in production and ramping to customers and will officially launch on December 14 in New York City. Sierra Forest, our first E-core Xeon is on track for first-half '24 with customers well into their validation process. Sierra Forest will feature up to 288 E-cores targeting next-generation cloud-native workloads, delivering even more price performance and power efficiency for our customers. Granite Rapids, which shortly follows Sierra Forest, is also well into our validation cycle with customers. While the industry has seen some wallet share shifts between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, as well as some inventory burn in the server market, we see signs of normalization as we enter Q4 driving modest sequential TAM growth. Across most customers, we expect to exit the year at healthy inventory levels, and we see growth in compute cores returning to more normal historical rates off the depressed 2023. More importantly, our successful road map execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids positioning us well to win back share in the data center. In addition, we expect to capture a growing portion of the accelerator market in 2024 with our suite of AI accelerators led by Gaudi, which is setting leadership benchmark results with third parties like MLCommons and Hugging Face. We are pleased with the customer momentum we are seeing from our accelerator portfolio and Gaudi in particular, and we have nearly doubled our pipeline over the last 90 days. As we look to 2024, like many others, we now are focused on having enough supply to meet our growing demand. Dell is partnering with us to deliver Gaudi for cloud and enterprise customers with its next-generation power edge systems featuring Xeon and Gaudi AI accelerators to support AI workloads ranging from large-scale training to inferencing at the edge. Together with Stability.ai, we are building one of the world's largest AI supercomputers entirely on 4th Gen Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerators. Our Gaudi road map remains on track with Gaudi3 out of the fab, now in packaging and expected to launch next year. And in 2025, Falcon Shores brings our GPU and Gaudi capabilities into a single product. Moving to the client. CCG delivered another strong quarter, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strength in commercial and consumer gaming SKUs where we are delivering leadership performance. As we expected, customers completed their inventory burn in the first-half of the year, driving solid sequential growth, which we expect will continue into Q4. We expect full-year 2023 PC consumption to be in line with our Q1 expectations of approximately 270 million units. In the near-term, we expect Windows 10 end-of-service to be a tailwind, and we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PC TAM returning to plus or minus 300 million units. Intel continues to be a pioneer in the industry as we ushered in the era of the AIPC in Q3 when we released the Intel Core Ultra processor code-named Meteor Lake. Built on Intel 4, the Intel Core Ultra has been shipping to customers for several weeks and will officially launch on December 14 alongside our 5th Gen Xeon. The Ultra represents the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros Advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It is also the first Intel client processor to feature our integrated neural processing unit, or NPU, that enables dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads. Next year, we will deliver Arrow Lake as well as Lunar Lake, which offers our next-gen NPU, ultra-low power mobility and breakthrough performance per watt. Panther Lake, our 2025 client offering, heads into the fab in Q1 '24 on Intel 18A. The arrival of the AIPC represents an inflection point in the PC industry, not seen since we first introduced Centrino in 2003. Centrino was so successful because of our time-to-market advantage, our embrace of an open ecosystem, strong OEM partnerships, our performance silicon and our developer scale. Not only are these same advantages in place today, they are even stronger as we enter the age of the AIPC. We are catalyzing this moment with our AIPC acceleration program with over 100 ISVs already participating, providing access to Intel's deep bench of engineering talent for targeted software optimization, core development tools and go-to-market opportunities. We are encouraged and motivated by our partners and competitors who see the tremendous growth potential of the PC market. NEX is also seeing early signs of the benefits from growing AI use cases. Our ethnic and IPU businesses are well suited to support the high I/O bandwidth required by AI workloads in the data center with growth expected to accelerate for both in 2024. Additionally, at the edge, as part of Intel's focus on every aspect of the AI continuum, NEX launched OpenVINO 2023.1, the latest version of the AI inferencing and deployment run time of choice for developers on client and edge platforms, with AI.io and Fit Match demonstrating how they use OpenVINO to accelerate their applications at our innovation conference. We have leadership developer software tool chains that have seen a doubling of developer engagements this year. While NEX entered their inventory correction after client in DCAI, Q3 results beat our internal forecast and grew sequentially. We see continued signs of stabilization heading into Q4. Finally, our Smart Capital strategy underpins our relentless drive for efficiency and our commitment to be great allocators of our owners' capital while consistently looking for innovative ways to unlock value for all our stakeholders. We remain on track to reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023, and we continue to see significant incremental opportunities for operational improvement as we execute on our internal foundry model. In addition, in Q3, we made the decision to divest the pluggable module portion of our silicon photonics business, allowing us to focus on the higher-value component business and optical I/O solutions to enable AI infrastructure scaling. This marks the tenth business we have exited in the last 2.5 years, generating $1.8 billion in annual savings and a testament to our efforts to optimize our portfolio and drive long-term value creation. Mobileye's solid Q3 and Q4 outlook continue to underscore the benefits of increased autonomy afforded by our initial public offering last year. In addition, we added TSMC as a minority investor in our IMS nano fabrication business in Q3. And earlier this month, we announced our plans to operate PSG as a stand-alone business beginning January 1. Similar to Mobileye and IMS, this decision gives PSG the mandate, focus and resources to better capitalize on their growth opportunities. We plan to report PSG results as a stand-alone segment in Q1, to bring in private investors in 2024 and to create a path to an initial public offering over the next two to three years. In summary, we continue to deliver tangible progress 2.5 years into our transformation journey. We are on track with five nodes in four years. We are hitting or beating all our product road map milestones. We are establishing ourselves as a global at-scale systems foundry for both wafer processing and advanced packaging. We are unlocking new growth opportunities fueled by AI. And we are driving financial discipline and operational efficiencies as we continue to unlock value for our shareholders. While we are encouraged by our progress to date, we know we have much more work in front of us as we continue to relentlessly drive forward with our strategy, maintain our execution momentum and deliver our commitments to our customers. I'd like to personally thank the Intel family for all their efforts. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to go through our results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter financially on top of outstanding execution on our product and process road maps as we continue to drive our IDM 2.0 transformation. We beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. While we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business, and we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. Third quarter revenue was $14.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and $750 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations across all major lines of business. Gross margin was 45.8%, 280 basis points better than our guidance, driven by higher revenue and ASPs and better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, beating guidance by $0.21, as our revenue strength, improving gross margins and disciplined OpEx management resulted in sequential EPS growth of $0.28. Q3 operating cash flow was $5.8 billion, up $3 billion sequentially. Net inventory was down $500 million or 7 days in the quarter. We also significantly improved the linearity of our shipments, which brought DSO down by 5 days. In total, our working capital improvement initiatives have yielded more than $2 billion of cash year-to-date. Net CapEx was $4.9 billion, resulting in positive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. In Q3, we announced the sale of 10% of our IMS nano fabrication business to TSMC, following the investment from Bain Capital in June. When combined with the Mobileye IPO, these transactions have unlocked more than $30 billion of value. Earlier this month, we signaled our intent to pursue private investment and ultimately, an IPO for our PSG business as we continue to pursue opportunities to increase value for our shareholders. Moving to third quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $7.9 billion, up 16% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Customer inventory levels are healthy, and the market remains on track to our January consumption TAM signal of roughly 270 million units for 2023. CCG's operating profit doubled sequentially to $2.1 billion on higher revenue, sell-through of reserved inventory and stronger ASPs driven by strength in our commercial and gaming products in the quarter. DCAI revenue was $3.8 billion, ahead of our internal forecast. Despite continued unit TAM softness, the Xeon business was up sequentially, with MNC customers showing a better than seasonal recovery in the quarter. Favorable customer mix, along with strong adoption of newer products with higher core density, led to record Xeon ASPs in Q3. Despite sequential revenue decline, DCAI returned to profitability and contributed operating profit of $71 million, improving sequentially on better ASPs, reduced factory underload charges and continued spending discipline. Within DCAI, revenue for the Programmable Solutions Group declined mid-teens percent sequentially. As we discussed earlier this month, after a period of strong growth and tight supply, the FPGA business is entering a period of inventory burn. We expect PSG to decline in Q4 and be depressed for the next few quarters as customers work through inventory before returning to a more normalized run rate and growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% sequentially. Edge markets showed signs of recovery in Q3, leading NEX revenue to exceed our expectations. Network and telco markets continue to work through elevated inventory and weak demand, which we expect to persist through the end of the year. NEX also returned to profitability in Q3 with operating profit of $17 million, up $200 million sequentially on stronger revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $311 million, growing 4 times year-over-year and 34% sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS tools. IFS operating loss was $86 million as ramping factory and operating expenses offset stronger revenue in the period. Mobileye continues to perform well. Q3 revenue was $530 million, up 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, with operating profit of $107 million on a consolidated basis, up 32% sequentially. This morning, Mobileye increased their fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 7% at the midpoint. Q3 represented another outstanding quarter of cross-company spending discipline and focused portfolio management with operating expenses down 15% year-over-year. While we're on track to achieve $3 billion of total spending reductions in 2023, we expect sequentially higher OpEx in Q4 due to seasonal marketing activities, higher profit-dependent compensation and the end of some temporary austerity measures taken earlier in the year. We also had a onetime credit in Q3 associated with an asset sale, which will impact the sequential comparison in Q4. Now turning to Q4 guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $14.6 billion to $15.6 billion, delivering on our January commitment to grow revenue sequentially throughout 2023. In the client business, we're encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles as our channel checks, partner feedback and ASPs all point to healthy inventory levels and growing demand. We expect moderate sequential growth from DCAI, with Xeon's strength more than offsetting a decline in PSG and continued recovery in edge markets roughly offsetting persistent network weakness. At the revenue midpoint of $15.1 billion, we expect gross margin to flow through at approximately 60% of revenue growth, resulting in Q4 gross margin of approximately 46.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.44. We continue to operate under our Smart Capital framework. In Q3, we received a capital grant from the State of Ohio and our first foundry prepay. In addition, we continue to work with the U.S. CHIPS Office on their review of our four U.S. applications. And we continue to work with Germany, Poland and the European Commission on our planned expansions in Europe. There are no changes to our prior forecast of mid-30s percent net capital intensity across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate. Capital offsets will trend towards the higher end of our 20% to 30% range in that time frame, though we do expect the vast majority of those offsets to land in 2024. In closing, Q3 was Intel's strongest quarter since we began our transformation. We achieved significant milestones toward regaining process leadership on Intel 18A, delivered Meteor Lake and Emerald Rapids on time, secured multiple wafer and advanced packaging foundry customers and delivered another quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. We will continue to make significant investments as we execute the IDM 2.0 strategy, and we remain confident and committed to our long-term financial targets. We're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market. We're steadily closing structural cost gaps, and we continue to make progress toward delivering the financial returns that we and our owners expect. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we go to our first caller?\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Dave, I just wanted to see if you can clear up some of the confusion on gross margin that sort of came out of the innovation event. You're now coming out of the year at 46.5% but you did roughly 43% for the year. And I think at that event, you said next year is going to be up but probably not a couple of hundred basis points. So did you mean off of the Q4 run rate or do you mean off of the 43% for the year? And can you kind of shape that for us throughout the year?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Well, let me just -- if you don't mind, let me step back. I want to talk a little bit about Q3 for a second because Q3, I was really proud of the team's performance in terms of gross margins for Q3 coming in just shy of 46%. It was great execution in terms of spending from the team. They also did work on the underloading, which helped, and we were able to sell through some previously reserved inventory, and so that really helped propel the gross margin. So we had phenomenal fall-through in the third quarter. I'd say fourth quarter, we start to go back to what would be more of our typical fall-through range, somewhat muted by the fact that we are still going through 5 nodes in 4 years. There is spend associated with that, which kind of mutes us. So we're probably a little bit higher normally in terms of fall-through, but with that, it's probably like a 60% fall-through. That's kind of the normal range we think of, and that's what we're guiding for the fourth quarter. Beyond that, we'll save the rest of the commentary for next year when we close out '23. I would just say just on a longer-term basis, Pat has talked a lot about gross margins of 60%. And I feel like we are even more confident around our ability to hit that 60% threshold for a number of reasons. One, the execution that Pat talked about on five nodes in four years. When we get through that, of course, we eliminate the headwind on margins, but it turns around to a tailwind because when you're a process leader, you get better gross margins. Also as product execution improves, that also as we launch the products that are competitive in the marketplace. And we've seen that already in the client space, that helps on the gross margin side. But then more importantly, maybe the thing that's near and dear to my heart is this internal foundry model that we've built, where we're now measuring the manufacturing and TD organization as a separate P&L. We'll officially do that next year and we'll segment report it that way. But we're already this year starting to look at it that way in operations reviews. We're starting to do the planning for next year in that -- with that lens. We're doing the long-term plan in that lens. And all the things that we thought we would see in the dialogue between those functions, we're already starting to see now. We see the product organizations already starting to optimize around test times, around stepping, around how many samples and hot lots they do in the fab. Suddenly, things they didn't spend a lot of time thinking about before, they care a lot about now. And we're already starting to see improvements in the P&L because of that. On the same front, in manufacturing, they're now really, really worried about loadings. They're worried about a P&L. They want to drive the most revenue they can in their P&L, try to drive the cost down as much as possible. So I just think that we will see a lot of opportunities as we progress through '24 and beyond that are really going to make an impact on gross margins and give us a lot of confidence around this 60%.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a quick follow-up?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do, I do, yes. Pat, can you just talk about the dynamics and maybe the allocation that you're getting from your major foundry partner? They went kind of out of their way to sort of go at the idea that your -- that 18A is going to be comparable to what they'll have in that same time frame. So now that it's becoming a little more apparent that you are making progress, has there been any change in that relationship and the allocation that you're getting from them? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And first, I'd say we're -- come to a different conclusion than what you might have heard from them. We feel that our five nodes in four years, the leadership position that we expect with Intel 18A, this is a remarkable set of work. And as you heard me say in my formal comments, we think of 18A as a work of art. This is the finest transistor, right? And we've invented the last 30-years of transistors. This is the best one that's ever been built, right? And that and PowerVia, we feel very confident that we are on track to the leadership position that we described. And as we've also said, hey, we're well underway on the things after that. And things like high-NA, the next generation of EUV or advanced packaging with glass, all of these are now being backed up and reinforced by their customer commitments. Three 18A customers now making commitments, the prepay customer I spoke about earlier, two additional customers, partners, we announced the ARM relationship in April, and they're now seeing very positive results on power performance area from 18A. And as we think about the relationship with TSMC, hey, this is a great company and one that we partner with, one that we are a competitor to, one that we're a customer of. We collaborate with them. As you saw, they became an investor in the IMS business this quarter as well. And as a customer of those, we're very happy with how they're supporting us and our products as we're raising many of these products forward to there, a critical supplier to us as we're a critical supplier to them. This is one of the most critical relationships in the industry. I spent a lot of time personally on it. We're very confident in our road map. And this is really an exceptional quarter for five nodes in four years and getting back to process leadership. We are well on our way to doing exactly what we said we would.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for asking a question. Pat, I wanted to follow-up on one of the topics you just mentioned about your partnership with ARM. The flip side of that is there's been reports recently of a number of people entering the CPU business for PCs using ARM architectures similar to what we've seen over the last couple of years on the data center side of things. Can you just talk about the competitive landscape of x86 versus ARM? And potentially, more importantly, if in fact, ARM was gaining traction, would you consider using that architecture and kind of broaden your technology internally?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Ross. And overall, I think what you're seeing is the industry is excited around the AIPC. And as I declared this generation of AIPC at our Innovation Conference a couple of months ago, we're seeing that materialize and customers, competitors seeing excitement around that. ARM and Windows client alternatives, generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business. And we take all competition seriously. But I think history as our guide here, we don't see these potentially being all that significant overall. Our momentum is strong. We have a strong road map, Meteor Lake launching this AIPC generation December 14. Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, we've already demonstrated the next-generation product at Lunar Lake, which has significant improvements in performance and capabilities. We'll be signing Panther Lake, the next generation in the fab in Q1 and Intel 18A. We announced our AI Acceleration program, which already has over 100 ISVs part of it. We'll have -- we expect in the next two years over 100 million x86 million AI-enhanced PCs in the marketplace. This is just an extraordinary amount of volume. The ecosystem benefits that, that brings into the marketplace. When thinking about other alternative architectures like ARM, we also say, wow, what a great opportunity for our foundry business. And given the results I referenced before, we see that as a unique opportunity that we have to participate in the full success of the ARM ecosystem or whatever market segments that may be as an accelerant to our foundry offerings, which are now becoming, we think, very significant around the ARM ecosystem with our foundry packaging and 18A wafer capabilities as well.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?\nRoss Seymore: Yes, I do. One for Dave. The OpEx side of things, you guys did great in the third quarter. You talked about it going up in the fourth quarter, but I still think the full-year is ahead of what you originally had targeted. How do we think about next year's OpEx just conceptually? I know you said you're going to have $3 billion in total cost savings this year, $8 billion to $10 billion longer term. What are the puts and takes on OpEx as we look into 2024?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So again, back to the pride thing, I'm really proud of what we did in the third quarter and really what we've been able to execute for the year on that spend reduction. There was a lot of work associated with that. We had to drive a lot of, obviously, efficiency. But more importantly, as Pat talked about, we kind of end of -- or we took 10 programs or product areas and either divested of them or closed them out in an effort to improve our spending. And as we see -- and in addition to that, I would say that we also looked at businesses where we thought we could dramatically unlock value. And we think we've done the three areas that we thought most likely unlock value. So I think from that perspective, we feel we're pretty done with the activities associated with spending. And so that said, we are -- we do think we'll see benefit from our internal foundry model not only on the cost side but also on the OpEx side. And so that's the area that we'll focus over the long-term in terms of managing spending. And ultimately, the goal is to get to 60% gross margins but it's also to get to 40% operating margins. So that does entail driving efficiency in OpEx and we think there's plenty of opportunity. I'd say the same thing on OpEx that I said on gross margins. We'll save the fourth quarter -- or the \u201824 visibility for \u201824 when we close out \u201823.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I think you talked about the Gaudi pipeline doubling in the last 90-days, so I guess you're nearing kind of $2 billion of visibility there. Can you talk to that a little bit, how much of that is training versus inference?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And overall, I'd just say there's a lot -- a surge of interest in this category, Joe. In the Gaudi business for us, we're coming from a small base but it's expanding rapidly. We do see a mix of training opportunities and inferencing opportunities. When we go to the inferencing side of the workload, which we think will be the significant expansion of workload going forward, a few people generate models, a lot of people use them. Sort of like how many people do weather modeling? Not many. How many people use weather models? A lot. And that's how we think about training and inferencing? So the power, the market will be in the inferencing deployments. And that will be both a Gaudi play as well as a Xeon play. And I would point to the example that we spoke about, for instance, with Dell where they really see bringing together both of those to give us a full portfolio of adding inferencing to existing workloads where our AI-enhanced Xeons will be strong as well as creating farms for inference, inference or for training where Gaudi will be more of a play. Now the interest that we've seen in Gaudi is a worldwide statement. So we have demand portfolio that really sort of matches the Intel balance across all geographies. We're also seeing a huge upsurge in the amount of cloud where this provides the fast on-ramp to the Intel AI and all of our advanced silicon offerings. But I'd also say, Joe, that this is an AI everywhere play, as I said in my formal comments, which is also edge and client as well. So we view it as edge, client, on-premise data center as well as a cloud. And this AI continuum is a unique position for Intel that we think gives us a very large opportunity to see this upside of capabilities that the AI workload is going to drive across all elements of computing.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up?\nJoe Moore: Yes, I do. In terms of that Gaudi business, do you anticipate any impact from the China export controls? And more broadly, are there any other impacts from the China export controls on Intel's business?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Joe. And I do think there's a lot of interest in that. On the export controls, as you look at them and read them, they're very much aimed at the high-end training and these accelerator, the high-end accelerators on where they are aimed. Now obviously, some of that was for us as well in China. But we also, as I said, in the first part of your question, we saw a worldwide demand for our activities there. And overall, we're now supply constrained on Gaudi and racing to catch up to that supply worldwide. Of course, we're studying those -- the new BIS released rules carefully. We're working with BIS. We're in the 60-day comment period with BIS so we're actively working with them. We do believe that we'll have plenty of opportunity in China continuing to deploy our products there broadly even as we comply and work with BIS specifically around the regulations that they're putting in place, particularly around high-end accelerators and AI training. So overall, we feel and have included that as part of our overall guidance for the fourth quarter. We feel good about the momentum that we have for AI everywhere, and we'll, of course, be engaging with our customers, the governments and as we build out our road map taking all of that into consideration.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Pat, I was wondering if you could unpack your foundry comments. You have the customer that we've known about, where there's prepays. I think you mentioned there's two more customers that you're signing up and another by year-end, and then there's an event in the first quarter. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more detail and talk about how that's going to flow through and the materiality into the coming years as well.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. So we announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well since that point in time, and the relationship is expanding with that customer. But we also added two more customers this quarter as well, so now we have 3 committed external customers on Intel 18A. At the beginning of the year, I promised you one. Here we are in the third quarter, we have three, and I hope to finish at least the fourth before the end of the year. Also with 18A, this PDK milestone, and if you're inside of the industry, hitting PDK 0.9 is a really critical milestone. As I said in my formal comments, this is when the invention phase is done. And now we're into the productization phase, ramping yields, refining performance and getting the process capabilities ready for manufacturing. So a critical milestone which we also say now as we release that to external customers, now a lot of them can start looking at 18A, and we start fanning out the engagements that we have in the industry. So a critical milestone on 18A. But the other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. And this is the 1 that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. So we completed two additional customers, so three 18A wafer customers, two additional packaging customers, and we have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with six additional packaging customers as well. And I think about this as the fast on-ramp to the Intel Foundry Services. And a wafer customer's multiple billion dollar customer. A packaging customer is hundreds of millions of dollars. And that billions of dollars takes two to three years to materialize. The wafer customers takes two to three quarters to materialize, right, in the packaging. So this is a much faster way for us to build out that business. And we're going to start to see those packaging customers start to materialize for us in revenue next year. And you add to that the Synopsys partnership, the ARM momentum, the Tower agreement, this was really the flywheel of momentum has now begun for the Intel Foundry Services business. It really is putting points up across the board for that business, and super happy with the amount of energy that we're now seeing across the industry for the foundry business. This was a great quarter for foundry at Intel.\nJohn Pitzer: Ben, do you have a follow-up?\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Going to switch gears to PCs, your comments there. You've talked about inventories normalizing. I just wanted to hear a little bit more detail on your confidence in that. Are you -- do you have confidence that the inventory builds are matching demand? And how do you see that playing out next year? It sounds like you think the TAM will grow back to 300 million, so just wanted some comments on that.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Three quarters in a row, we've seen the client business being very healthy now for us. Our customers' inventory levels are very healthy in that regard. So we see our sell-in being matched by a sellout for those customers. As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. And here we are three weeks into the quarter and I'd say it's looking really good. So our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for the fourth quarter. And we do think this idea of ushering in the AIPC generation will be a multiyear cycle. So we do think this will bring excitement into the category even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Win 10 end-of-service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it. And finally, our road map is great. And Meteor Lake looking good, rapidly ramping what we have coming with Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake and then Panther Lake in the future. So every aspect of this business is demonstrating health, maturity, momentum and great opportunity for tomorrow.\nDavid Zinsner: I'd just add one other thing. When we track the linearity of shipments, linearity was really, really good in the third quarter, and it's off to a really good start for the fourth quarter. And generally, when you see really steady shipment across the entire quarter, that's a good sign that you kind of balanced out the inventory and you're really just kind of shipping in what's shipping out.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect, thank you, Ben. Johnathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question, please.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you very much. This is either for Pat or for Dave. I just wanted to come back to the DCAI. In the PowerPoint, you mentioned competitive pressure but I think, Dave, if I heard you correct, you said ASPs were a record. Could you just explain what you meant by competitive pressure because I would have thought that would have led to ASPs being lower, or was its impact was on the unit side?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, and there's a couple of things to unpack there. Just our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year even that are just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping Sapphire Rapids, which has a higher ASP more rapidly than we would have expected also as we go to the higher core count versions, that drives up the per socket ASP more aggressively. So overall, we definitely feel those competitive pressures. And as I say, we're working for issues that began years ago. But we're also combining that with Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen 5, the road map for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids which have much higher core counts, which will drive higher ASPs as well. So all of that put together, we do feel like we're on a very solid trajectory for the business overall. We will see ASPs continue to rise. The road map is very healthy as we go forward. And I feel like the market and our customers are starting to feel that competitiveness come back to our business here and looking forward to the benefits that a stronger Intel road map will offer to them and their businesses.\nJohn Pitzer: Ambrish, do you have a follow-up question?\nAmbrish Srivastava: I did. I have a follow-up. Intel showing pretty steady execution and I can't say that in the last several years, we haven't seen that. But just coming back to the long-term model that Dave you were talking about, can you just help us understand what are the parameters around that revenue, mix of the business? Because you will have an IFS which would be dilutive to gross margin, potentially not to operating margin. But what's the right way to think about that 60-40 in terms of the business mix and even size of the business?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I'd say I think the first thing to kind of improve the gross margins is going to be around getting ourselves finally to process leadership and getting the products completely, as Pat was talking about, the product road map improving significantly, getting to the -- to where we have definitive leadership across all products. I think those two things will drive a significant lift on the gross margins, irrespective of anything else we have on the business front. And then when I look at, as I talked about this internal foundry model, I just think there's so much low-hanging fruit on the cost side, both in the business units and also in the manufacturing TD are kind of internal foundry business, that there's significant improvement that we can make on gross margins. Yes, mix does have an impact on the business, and we have a wide range of products that will have different margins. But almost all of them are punching below their weight right now. And as we improve all of them, that should lift the gross margins meaningfully over time.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Ambrish. Johnathan, can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and also congrats on the execution in the quarter. Kind of going back to the prior question, just thinking about the trajectory of the ASP expansion in the Data Center segment. How do I look at that and kind of think about what the normalizing operating profit might look like in DCAI as you guys look out over time? I know that you turned profitable this quarter. I'm just trying to think about -- understand how you guys are thinking about the path of profitability in that segment.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Maybe I'll start. Pat, feel free to chime in. Obviously, it was, I think, pretty important for us to show profitability this quarter. That was one of Pat and I's goals written on a sheet of paper that we wanted to see this business return to profitability. That said, it's making a lot of investments right now to improve the product portfolio on the CPU side and make the investments necessary on the AI front. But this business longer term should have margins that are very similar to margins you see from its peers when they are operating at healthy levels of margins. And so we have a lot of work to do to get there but I think the path is pretty clear. And of course, ASP will be a component of that but there's a lot of efficiencies that you can drive beyond just ASPs that will improve the margins longer term.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And as Dave and I think about the 60-40 model that we're driving to long term, we think about the Data Center business being above that for it, where some of the more volume-oriented businesses like client might be a little bit below that. But taken together, that's how we're driving the business. And overall, as we said, we see a lot of margin expansion potential across Data Center, Client, Networking and Foundry as we get back to process leadership and build that business up. I'd also emphasize that as we build our foundry capacity, we build more capacity in our factory network for our internal and external customers. That's a tide that lifts all boats for us because it improves the profitability not just the foundry but the competitiveness and the profitability of our product businesses as well. So overall, we feel like this is a really important milestone for us this quarter, seeing not just great financial results but the operational results were even better than that, which is what led me to say, hey, this was an outstanding quarter for us overall.\nJohn Pitzer: Aaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\nAaron Rakers: Yes, I do, and thanks for the detail there. As a quick follow-up, just kind of thinking about the gross margin line. I'm curious, Dave, I know last quarter, I think it was, I want to say it was $220-or-so million factory underload impact in gross margin. It sounds like you had a reversal of inventory reserve and gross margin this quarter. Are we done with the factory underload or what was that number? And how are you thinking about that embedded in the gross margin guide?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I mean, it was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. But we'll be kind of dealing with this underload hangover, I'd call it, probably all through next year as we kind of progress, largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis, we'll still have all of that underload kind of tied up in the cost of the wafers in inventory, and that still has to get flushed through before we're completely done. So meaningful improvement. I'd say we have -- we're largely out of the woods but still some wood to chop through next year to where we're completely clean in underload.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Aron. Jonathan, I think we have time for one last caller.\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question please.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon guys. Before I start, I just wanted to say a bit, Pat, Dave and all the Intel folks, we're thinking about all your folks in Israel. And so maybe you'll take this question that I need to ask it, I guess, do reference to that. Unlike a lot of your competitors and peers, you guys actually have operations and fabs in Israel. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update there of how these are going operationally, just given the atrocities that have gone on, what the size of the wafer output of those fabs are, what nodes they're on? Any kind of detail there would be really helpful.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And hey, as one of the earliest companies in Israel now, almost 50 years that we're in country, I appreciate deeply. These are the Intel team. This is people that I consider friends personally as well. That said, the resilience of the Intel team is remarkable. And despite all of these challenges, we'll say they're not missing a single commitment. They're performing extremely well. We continue to deliver the products that they're working on and continuing to drive the factory operations and our factory expansions that we have there. That said, one of the benefits of Intel's multi-geo supply chain that we uniquely have in the industry is resilient. And Intel 7 is running a factory there in Israel. We also have two other locations that we run Intel 7. We're making sure that we have the resilience of our supply chain for all of those products so that we can be very assured, even as we're highly confident in the capabilities of our Intel Israel team to continue to perform despite the atrocities, we're also confident that we have a resilience in our core business model that gives us flexibility to assure supply and continued operation across the globe regardless of what issue you may have in Asia, Americas, Europe, Middle East, we are well positioned to deliver that for our customers across all of our operations.\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-up?\nMatt Ramsay: Yes, I do. As my follow-up, one of the things that I keep getting asked about a ton is the CapEx swing that's happened towards gen AI infrastructure. And I guess the way that I've been kind of phrasing the question is the video killed the radio star question, right? Is this the death of CPU growth in the data center? And I don't think it is, to be clear, but there's some out there to do. So Pat, you made some comments in your script and then some other answers about return to normalcy on data center CPU from a growth perspective. Maybe you can give a few day points or antidotes that might support that.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in gen AI, which has, over a couple of quarters, driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys, in particular, to where do they put their floor space? Where do they put their power budgets, right? And that's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place. That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment of those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future. And that will -- some of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run, right, on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-ification of existing applications. And given the leadership performance that we have on our Gen 4 for AI applications, that gets better with Gen 5. And when we deliver Granite Rapids, it gets 2 times to 3 times better, as I said in the comments. It gets even better as we go further out into the road map. So the ability for us to do inferencing at scale on our Xeon product line, we think, is very profound as we go forward. The road map is very healthy. The combination of Gaudi and our Xeons, that is exactly what you heard Dell announce in their road map. And we're just seeing, I'll say, the normalcy of that in the buying behavior. We saw a very good uptick for our OEMs this quarter as they're seeing their Xeon businesses. We're also seeing more ecosystem embrace our DevCloud. Lots of customers coming on it for both AI use cases on Xeon and on Gaudi. Key announcements like we had from Deloitte as they're partnering with us across application optimization as well as AI development on Xeon platform. So overall, we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a cycle that there will be growth in CPUs led by Xeon, as well as accelerators. And Intel is going to be participating in both of those capacities in meaningful ways. And this is part of what we said is AI everywhere. AI at the edge, AI at the client, AI in the data center and AI in the cloud, but inferencing will be the discussion topic for the industry as we go into \u201824. That will be done at scale and much of that is going to be done on Xeons. So with that, let's just thank you for joining us. Again, I want to reiterate our thoughts for our resilient Intel team in Israel and for all of those in the region that are affected by recent events. I also want to thank you for joining us on the call again today and your interest in Intel. We appreciate the opportunity to update you, answer your questions, respond to that. Most important, we are excited by the momentum we're seeing. As I said, the financial results were great. The operational results were truly outstanding this quarter. And it's a confirmation of our foundry strategy, of our five nodes everywhere, of our AI everywhere strategy. And we do hope that you're able to join us for our launch of Emerald Rapids Gen 5, Meteor Lake, Core Ultra in New York in December. And I do also hope to see you all at our Q1 Intel Foundry Day. Thank you. Good afternoon, good night wherever in the world you'd be. Take care and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, given our significant and now almost 50-year presence in Israel, we are deeply saddened by the recent attacks and their impact on the region. Our utmost priority is the safety and welfare of our people in Israel and their families. But I also want to recognize the resilience of our teams as they have kept our operations running and our factory expansion progressing. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the war, and I am praying for a swift return to peace. Turning to our results, we delivered an outstanding Q3, beating expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was above the high-end of our guidance and EPS benefited from both strong operating leverage and expense discipline. More important than our standout financial performance were the key operational milestones we achieved in the quarter across process and products, Intel Foundry Services, and our strategy to bring AI everywhere. Simply put, this quarter demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. The foundation of our strategy is reestablishing transistor power and performance leadership. While many thought our ambitions were a bit audacious when we began our five nodes and four-year journey roughly 2.5-years ago, we have increasing line of sight towards achieving our goal. Intel 7 is done with nearly 150 million units in aggregate of Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids already in the market. In addition, Emerald Rapids has achieved product release and began shipping this month. In Q3, we began initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4, which we are now aggressively ramping on the most productive fleet of EUV tools in the industry, providing us with a greater than 20% capital efficiency advantage, compared to when EUV tools were first launched. High volume EUV manufacturing is well underway in Oregon and more recently in Ireland. Our FAB 34 in Ireland represents the first high volume EUV production in Europe, underscoring our commitment to establish geographically diverse and resilient supply. We are the only leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer at scale in every major region of the globe. Our Intel 3 process is tracking to be manufacturing ready by year-end, supporting our first two Intel 3 products, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. In fact, our production stepping of Sierra Forest is already out of fab, and what we expect to be the production stepping of Granite Rapids has already taped in and is in the fab now. We are particularly excited by our move into the Angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A. Adding to our accelerating adoption of EUV are two key new innovations, RibbonFET and PowerVIA, representing the first fundamental change to the transistor and process architecture since we commercialized FinFET in 2012. I have been studying SEM diagrams for almost 40-years. RibbonFET and PowerVIA are true works of art, the most exquisite transistors ever created. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness on Intel 20A in the first-half of 2024. Arrow Lake, our lead product on 20A, is already running Windows and demonstrating excellent functionality. Even more significant, we hit a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the 0.9 release of the PDK with imminent availability to external customers. In simple terms, the invention phase of RibbonFET and PowerVIA is now complete, and we are racing towards production-ready, industry-leading process technology. Our first products on Intel 18A will go into fab on schedule in Q1 \u201824 with Clearwater Forest for servers, Panther Lake for clients, and of course a growing number of IFS test chips. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness for Intel 18A in second-half 24, completing our incredible five nodes and four years journey on or ahead of schedule. While Intel 18A reestablishes transistor leadership, we are racing to increase that lead. We announced that innovation are plans to lead the industry in a move to glass substrate for high density, performance, and unique optical capabilities. We also announced our plans to begin installation of the world's first high NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year to continue our modernizations and infrastructure expansions of our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon, home of our technology development team. Moore's Law continues to be the foundational driver of semiconductor technology and economics, which, in turn, fuels broader innovation in every industry across the globe. We remain committed to be good stewards of Moore's Law and drive advancements until we have exhausted every element on the periodic table. Importantly, our progress on process technology is now being well validated by third parties. We have made great progress with early IFS customers this quarter, which we expect to only accelerate with the release of the 0.9 PDK for Intel 18A. A major customer committed to Intel 18A and Intel 3, which includes a meaningful prepayment that expedites and expands our capacity corridor for this customer. The customer is seeing particularly good power, performance and area efficiency in their design. This opportunity is very significant and highlights our full system's foundry capabilities and high-performance computing, big die designs, leadership performance and area efficient transistors, advanced packaging and systems expertise. In addition, we are extremely pleased to announce today that we have signed with two additional 18A customers. Both are particularly focused in areas of high-performance compute and benefiting from power performance per unit silicon area. We have also made substantial progress with our next major customer and are expecting to conclude commercial contract negotiations before year-end. Finally, we were also very happy to expand our growing foundry ecosystem by completing our strategic partnership with Synopsys in Q3 to include IP for Intel 3 and Intel 18A for both Intel internal and external foundry customers. With the rise of AI and high-performance computing applications, our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another unique advantage. We have seen a surge of interest in our advanced packaging from most leading AI chip companies. With capacity corridors quickly available, this is proving to be a significant accelerant and on-ramp for Intel foundry customers. During the quarter, we were awarded two customer AI designs for our advanced packaging and with an additional six customers in active negotiations, we expect several more awards by year-end. We have also established an important business relationship with Tower Semiconductor, utilizing our manufacturing assets in New Mexico, along with Tower investing capital expenditures of roughly $300 million for its use in this facility. This represents an important step in our foundry strategy, improving cash flows by utilizing our manufacturing assets over a significantly longer period of time. Finally, we have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, representing over $100 billion of U.S. manufacturing and research investments to the CHIPS Program Office and are working closely with them as they review these proposals. We look forward to providing a deeper update on our foundry business during our planned IFS industry event in Q1 of 2024. We are on a mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. We are empowering the market to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications. For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks and a very cost-efficient TCO. However, as the world moves towards more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift towards local inferencing. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost. With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra launching the AIPC generation and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than forcing it into the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. The AI continuum enables AI everywhere. DCAI exceeded our forecast this quarter with server revenue up modestly sequentially. We continue to see a strong ramp of our 4th Gen Xeon processor with the world's top 10 CSPs now in general availability and improving strength from MNCs. During the quarter, we shipped our 1 millionth 4th Gen Xeon unit and are on track to surpass 2 million units next month. 4th Gen Xeon includes powerful accelerators, demonstrating best-in-class CPU performance for AI, security and networking workloads. Our AI-enhanced Xeons are primed for model inferencing, enabling seamless infusion of AI into existing workloads. This was visible this quarter with over one-third of 4th Gen Xeon shipments directly related to AI applications. We are the clear leader in AI CPU results as seen in MLCommons benchmarks today, and our road map provides significant further improvements with Granite Rapids expected to deliver an additional 2 times to 3 times AI performance on top of our industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. We continue to make excellent progress with our Xeon road map. Our 5th Gen Xeon processor code-named Emerald Rapids is in production and ramping to customers and will officially launch on December 14 in New York City. Sierra Forest, our first E-core Xeon is on track for first-half '24 with customers well into their validation process. Sierra Forest will feature up to 288 E-cores targeting next-generation cloud-native workloads, delivering even more price performance and power efficiency for our customers. Granite Rapids, which shortly follows Sierra Forest, is also well into our validation cycle with customers. While the industry has seen some wallet share shifts between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, as well as some inventory burn in the server market, we see signs of normalization as we enter Q4 driving modest sequential TAM growth. Across most customers, we expect to exit the year at healthy inventory levels, and we see growth in compute cores returning to more normal historical rates off the depressed 2023. More importantly, our successful road map execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids positioning us well to win back share in the data center. In addition, we expect to capture a growing portion of the accelerator market in 2024 with our suite of AI accelerators led by Gaudi, which is setting leadership benchmark results with third parties like MLCommons and Hugging Face. We are pleased with the customer momentum we are seeing from our accelerator portfolio and Gaudi in particular, and we have nearly doubled our pipeline over the last 90 days. As we look to 2024, like many others, we now are focused on having enough supply to meet our growing demand. Dell is partnering with us to deliver Gaudi for cloud and enterprise customers with its next-generation power edge systems featuring Xeon and Gaudi AI accelerators to support AI workloads ranging from large-scale training to inferencing at the edge. Together with Stability.ai, we are building one of the world's largest AI supercomputers entirely on 4th Gen Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerators. Our Gaudi road map remains on track with Gaudi3 out of the fab, now in packaging and expected to launch next year. And in 2025, Falcon Shores brings our GPU and Gaudi capabilities into a single product. Moving to the client. CCG delivered another strong quarter, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strength in commercial and consumer gaming SKUs where we are delivering leadership performance. As we expected, customers completed their inventory burn in the first-half of the year, driving solid sequential growth, which we expect will continue into Q4. We expect full-year 2023 PC consumption to be in line with our Q1 expectations of approximately 270 million units. In the near-term, we expect Windows 10 end-of-service to be a tailwind, and we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PC TAM returning to plus or minus 300 million units. Intel continues to be a pioneer in the industry as we ushered in the era of the AIPC in Q3 when we released the Intel Core Ultra processor code-named Meteor Lake. Built on Intel 4, the Intel Core Ultra has been shipping to customers for several weeks and will officially launch on December 14 alongside our 5th Gen Xeon. The Ultra represents the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros Advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It is also the first Intel client processor to feature our integrated neural processing unit, or NPU, that enables dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads. Next year, we will deliver Arrow Lake as well as Lunar Lake, which offers our next-gen NPU, ultra-low power mobility and breakthrough performance per watt. Panther Lake, our 2025 client offering, heads into the fab in Q1 '24 on Intel 18A. The arrival of the AIPC represents an inflection point in the PC industry, not seen since we first introduced Centrino in 2003. Centrino was so successful because of our time-to-market advantage, our embrace of an open ecosystem, strong OEM partnerships, our performance silicon and our developer scale. Not only are these same advantages in place today, they are even stronger as we enter the age of the AIPC. We are catalyzing this moment with our AIPC acceleration program with over 100 ISVs already participating, providing access to Intel's deep bench of engineering talent for targeted software optimization, core development tools and go-to-market opportunities. We are encouraged and motivated by our partners and competitors who see the tremendous growth potential of the PC market. NEX is also seeing early signs of the benefits from growing AI use cases. Our ethnic and IPU businesses are well suited to support the high I/O bandwidth required by AI workloads in the data center with growth expected to accelerate for both in 2024. Additionally, at the edge, as part of Intel's focus on every aspect of the AI continuum, NEX launched OpenVINO 2023.1, the latest version of the AI inferencing and deployment run time of choice for developers on client and edge platforms, with AI.io and Fit Match demonstrating how they use OpenVINO to accelerate their applications at our innovation conference. We have leadership developer software tool chains that have seen a doubling of developer engagements this year. While NEX entered their inventory correction after client in DCAI, Q3 results beat our internal forecast and grew sequentially. We see continued signs of stabilization heading into Q4. Finally, our Smart Capital strategy underpins our relentless drive for efficiency and our commitment to be great allocators of our owners' capital while consistently looking for innovative ways to unlock value for all our stakeholders. We remain on track to reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023, and we continue to see significant incremental opportunities for operational improvement as we execute on our internal foundry model. In addition, in Q3, we made the decision to divest the pluggable module portion of our silicon photonics business, allowing us to focus on the higher-value component business and optical I/O solutions to enable AI infrastructure scaling. This marks the tenth business we have exited in the last 2.5 years, generating $1.8 billion in annual savings and a testament to our efforts to optimize our portfolio and drive long-term value creation. Mobileye's solid Q3 and Q4 outlook continue to underscore the benefits of increased autonomy afforded by our initial public offering last year. In addition, we added TSMC as a minority investor in our IMS nano fabrication business in Q3. And earlier this month, we announced our plans to operate PSG as a stand-alone business beginning January 1. Similar to Mobileye and IMS, this decision gives PSG the mandate, focus and resources to better capitalize on their growth opportunities. We plan to report PSG results as a stand-alone segment in Q1, to bring in private investors in 2024 and to create a path to an initial public offering over the next two to three years. In summary, we continue to deliver tangible progress 2.5 years into our transformation journey. We are on track with five nodes in four years. We are hitting or beating all our product road map milestones. We are establishing ourselves as a global at-scale systems foundry for both wafer processing and advanced packaging. We are unlocking new growth opportunities fueled by AI. And we are driving financial discipline and operational efficiencies as we continue to unlock value for our shareholders. While we are encouraged by our progress to date, we know we have much more work in front of us as we continue to relentlessly drive forward with our strategy, maintain our execution momentum and deliver our commitments to our customers. I'd like to personally thank the Intel family for all their efforts. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to go through our results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4. Yes. And first, I'd say we're -- come to a different conclusion than what you might have heard from them. We feel that our five nodes in four years, the leadership position that we expect with Intel 18A, this is a remarkable set of work. And as you heard me say in my formal comments, we think of 18A as a work of art. This is the finest transistor, right? And we've invented the last 30-years of transistors. This is the best one that's ever been built, right? And that and PowerVia, we feel very confident that we are on track to the leadership position that we described. And as we've also said, hey, we're well underway on the things after that. And things like high-NA, the next generation of EUV or advanced packaging with glass, all of these are now being backed up and reinforced by their customer commitments. Three 18A customers now making commitments, the prepay customer I spoke about earlier, two additional customers, partners, we announced the ARM relationship in April, and they're now seeing very positive results on power performance area from 18A. And as we think about the relationship with TSMC, hey, this is a great company and one that we partner with, one that we are a competitor to, one that we're a customer of. We collaborate with them. As you saw, they became an investor in the IMS business this quarter as well. And as a customer of those, we're very happy with how they're supporting us and our products as we're raising many of these products forward to there, a critical supplier to us as we're a critical supplier to them. This is one of the most critical relationships in the industry. I spent a lot of time personally on it. We're very confident in our road map. And this is really an exceptional quarter for five nodes in four years and getting back to process leadership. We are well on our way to doing exactly what we said we would. Yes. Thank you, Ross. And overall, I think what you're seeing is the industry is excited around the AIPC. And as I declared this generation of AIPC at our Innovation Conference a couple of months ago, we're seeing that materialize and customers, competitors seeing excitement around that. ARM and Windows client alternatives, generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business. And we take all competition seriously. But I think history as our guide here, we don't see these potentially being all that significant overall. Our momentum is strong. We have a strong road map, Meteor Lake launching this AIPC generation December 14. Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, we've already demonstrated the next-generation product at Lunar Lake, which has significant improvements in performance and capabilities. We'll be signing Panther Lake, the next generation in the fab in Q1 and Intel 18A. We announced our AI Acceleration program, which already has over 100 ISVs part of it. We'll have -- we expect in the next two years over 100 million x86 million AI-enhanced PCs in the marketplace. This is just an extraordinary amount of volume. The ecosystem benefits that, that brings into the marketplace. When thinking about other alternative architectures like ARM, we also say, wow, what a great opportunity for our foundry business. And given the results I referenced before, we see that as a unique opportunity that we have to participate in the full success of the ARM ecosystem or whatever market segments that may be as an accelerant to our foundry offerings, which are now becoming, we think, very significant around the ARM ecosystem with our foundry packaging and 18A wafer capabilities as well. Yes, thank you. And overall, I'd just say there's a lot -- a surge of interest in this category, Joe. In the Gaudi business for us, we're coming from a small base but it's expanding rapidly. We do see a mix of training opportunities and inferencing opportunities. When we go to the inferencing side of the workload, which we think will be the significant expansion of workload going forward, a few people generate models, a lot of people use them. Sort of like how many people do weather modeling? Not many. How many people use weather models? A lot. And that's how we think about training and inferencing? So the power, the market will be in the inferencing deployments. And that will be both a Gaudi play as well as a Xeon play. And I would point to the example that we spoke about, for instance, with Dell where they really see bringing together both of those to give us a full portfolio of adding inferencing to existing workloads where our AI-enhanced Xeons will be strong as well as creating farms for inference, inference or for training where Gaudi will be more of a play. Now the interest that we've seen in Gaudi is a worldwide statement. So we have demand portfolio that really sort of matches the Intel balance across all geographies. We're also seeing a huge upsurge in the amount of cloud where this provides the fast on-ramp to the Intel AI and all of our advanced silicon offerings. But I'd also say, Joe, that this is an AI everywhere play, as I said in my formal comments, which is also edge and client as well. So we view it as edge, client, on-premise data center as well as a cloud. And this AI continuum is a unique position for Intel that we think gives us a very large opportunity to see this upside of capabilities that the AI workload is going to drive across all elements of computing. Yes. Thanks, Joe. And I do think there's a lot of interest in that. On the export controls, as you look at them and read them, they're very much aimed at the high-end training and these accelerator, the high-end accelerators on where they are aimed. Now obviously, some of that was for us as well in China. But we also, as I said, in the first part of your question, we saw a worldwide demand for our activities there. And overall, we're now supply constrained on Gaudi and racing to catch up to that supply worldwide. Of course, we're studying those -- the new BIS released rules carefully. We're working with BIS. We're in the 60-day comment period with BIS so we're actively working with them. We do believe that we'll have plenty of opportunity in China continuing to deploy our products there broadly even as we comply and work with BIS specifically around the regulations that they're putting in place, particularly around high-end accelerators and AI training. So overall, we feel and have included that as part of our overall guidance for the fourth quarter. We feel good about the momentum that we have for AI everywhere, and we'll, of course, be engaging with our customers, the governments and as we build out our road map taking all of that into consideration. Yes. Thanks, Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. So we announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well since that point in time, and the relationship is expanding with that customer. But we also added two more customers this quarter as well, so now we have 3 committed external customers on Intel 18A. At the beginning of the year, I promised you one. Here we are in the third quarter, we have three, and I hope to finish at least the fourth before the end of the year. Also with 18A, this PDK milestone, and if you're inside of the industry, hitting PDK 0.9 is a really critical milestone. As I said in my formal comments, this is when the invention phase is done. And now we're into the productization phase, ramping yields, refining performance and getting the process capabilities ready for manufacturing. So a critical milestone which we also say now as we release that to external customers, now a lot of them can start looking at 18A, and we start fanning out the engagements that we have in the industry. So a critical milestone on 18A. But the other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. And this is the 1 that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. So we completed two additional customers, so three 18A wafer customers, two additional packaging customers, and we have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with six additional packaging customers as well. And I think about this as the fast on-ramp to the Intel Foundry Services. And a wafer customer's multiple billion dollar customer. A packaging customer is hundreds of millions of dollars. And that billions of dollars takes two to three years to materialize. The wafer customers takes two to three quarters to materialize, right, in the packaging. So this is a much faster way for us to build out that business. And we're going to start to see those packaging customers start to materialize for us in revenue next year. And you add to that the Synopsys partnership, the ARM momentum, the Tower agreement, this was really the flywheel of momentum has now begun for the Intel Foundry Services business. It really is putting points up across the board for that business, and super happy with the amount of energy that we're now seeing across the industry for the foundry business. This was a great quarter for foundry at Intel. Yes. Three quarters in a row, we've seen the client business being very healthy now for us. Our customers' inventory levels are very healthy in that regard. So we see our sell-in being matched by a sellout for those customers. As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. And here we are three weeks into the quarter and I'd say it's looking really good. So our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for the fourth quarter. And we do think this idea of ushering in the AIPC generation will be a multiyear cycle. So we do think this will bring excitement into the category even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Win 10 end-of-service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it. And finally, our road map is great. And Meteor Lake looking good, rapidly ramping what we have coming with Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake and then Panther Lake in the future. So every aspect of this business is demonstrating health, maturity, momentum and great opportunity for tomorrow. Yes, and there's a couple of things to unpack there. Just our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year even that are just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping Sapphire Rapids, which has a higher ASP more rapidly than we would have expected also as we go to the higher core count versions, that drives up the per socket ASP more aggressively. So overall, we definitely feel those competitive pressures. And as I say, we're working for issues that began years ago. But we're also combining that with Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen 5, the road map for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids which have much higher core counts, which will drive higher ASPs as well. So all of that put together, we do feel like we're on a very solid trajectory for the business overall. We will see ASPs continue to rise. The road map is very healthy as we go forward. And I feel like the market and our customers are starting to feel that competitiveness come back to our business here and looking forward to the benefits that a stronger Intel road map will offer to them and their businesses. Yes. And as Dave and I think about the 60-40 model that we're driving to long term, we think about the Data Center business being above that for it, where some of the more volume-oriented businesses like client might be a little bit below that. But taken together, that's how we're driving the business. And overall, as we said, we see a lot of margin expansion potential across Data Center, Client, Networking and Foundry as we get back to process leadership and build that business up. I'd also emphasize that as we build our foundry capacity, we build more capacity in our factory network for our internal and external customers. That's a tide that lifts all boats for us because it improves the profitability not just the foundry but the competitiveness and the profitability of our product businesses as well. So overall, we feel like this is a really important milestone for us this quarter, seeing not just great financial results but the operational results were even better than that, which is what led me to say, hey, this was an outstanding quarter for us overall. Yes. And hey, as one of the earliest companies in Israel now, almost 50 years that we're in country, I appreciate deeply. These are the Intel team. This is people that I consider friends personally as well. That said, the resilience of the Intel team is remarkable. And despite all of these challenges, we'll say they're not missing a single commitment. They're performing extremely well. We continue to deliver the products that they're working on and continuing to drive the factory operations and our factory expansions that we have there. That said, one of the benefits of Intel's multi-geo supply chain that we uniquely have in the industry is resilient. And Intel 7 is running a factory there in Israel. We also have two other locations that we run Intel 7. We're making sure that we have the resilience of our supply chain for all of those products so that we can be very assured, even as we're highly confident in the capabilities of our Intel Israel team to continue to perform despite the atrocities, we're also confident that we have a resilience in our core business model that gives us flexibility to assure supply and continued operation across the globe regardless of what issue you may have in Asia, Americas, Europe, Middle East, we are well positioned to deliver that for our customers across all of our operations. Yes. And I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in gen AI, which has, over a couple of quarters, driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys, in particular, to where do they put their floor space? Where do they put their power budgets, right? And that's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place. That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment of those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future. And that will -- some of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run, right, on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-ification of existing applications. And given the leadership performance that we have on our Gen 4 for AI applications, that gets better with Gen 5. And when we deliver Granite Rapids, it gets 2 times to 3 times better, as I said in the comments. It gets even better as we go further out into the road map. So the ability for us to do inferencing at scale on our Xeon product line, we think, is very profound as we go forward. The road map is very healthy. The combination of Gaudi and our Xeons, that is exactly what you heard Dell announce in their road map. And we're just seeing, I'll say, the normalcy of that in the buying behavior. We saw a very good uptick for our OEMs this quarter as they're seeing their Xeon businesses. We're also seeing more ecosystem embrace our DevCloud. Lots of customers coming on it for both AI use cases on Xeon and on Gaudi. Key announcements like we had from Deloitte as they're partnering with us across application optimization as well as AI development on Xeon platform. So overall, we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a cycle that there will be growth in CPUs led by Xeon, as well as accelerators. And Intel is going to be participating in both of those capacities in meaningful ways. And this is part of what we said is AI everywhere. AI at the edge, AI at the client, AI in the data center and AI in the cloud, but inferencing will be the discussion topic for the industry as we go into \u201824. That will be done at scale and much of that is going to be done on Xeons. So with that, let's just thank you for joining us. Again, I want to reiterate our thoughts for our resilient Intel team in Israel and for all of those in the region that are affected by recent events. I also want to thank you for joining us on the call again today and your interest in Intel. We appreciate the opportunity to update you, answer your questions, respond to that. Most important, we are excited by the momentum we're seeing. As I said, the financial results were great. The operational results were truly outstanding this quarter. And it's a confirmation of our foundry strategy, of our five nodes everywhere, of our AI everywhere strategy. And we do hope that you're able to join us for our launch of Emerald Rapids Gen 5, Meteor Lake, Core Ultra in New York in December. And I do also hope to see you all at our Q1 Intel Foundry Day. Thank you. Good afternoon, good night wherever in the world you'd be. Take care and be safe."

            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter financially on top of outstanding execution on our product and process road maps as we continue to drive our IDM 2.0 transformation. We beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. While we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business, and we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. Third quarter revenue was $14.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and $750 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations across all major lines of business. Gross margin was 45.8%, 280 basis points better than our guidance, driven by higher revenue and ASPs and better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, beating guidance by $0.21, as our revenue strength, improving gross margins and disciplined OpEx management resulted in sequential EPS growth of $0.28. Q3 operating cash flow was $5.8 billion, up $3 billion sequentially. Net inventory was down $500 million or 7 days in the quarter. We also significantly improved the linearity of our shipments, which brought DSO down by 5 days. In total, our working capital improvement initiatives have yielded more than $2 billion of cash year-to-date. Net CapEx was $4.9 billion, resulting in positive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. In Q3, we announced the sale of 10% of our IMS nano fabrication business to TSMC, following the investment from Bain Capital in June. When combined with the Mobileye IPO, these transactions have unlocked more than $30 billion of value. Earlier this month, we signaled our intent to pursue private investment and ultimately, an IPO for our PSG business as we continue to pursue opportunities to increase value for our shareholders. Moving to third quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $7.9 billion, up 16% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Customer inventory levels are healthy, and the market remains on track to our January consumption TAM signal of roughly 270 million units for 2023. CCG's operating profit doubled sequentially to $2.1 billion on higher revenue, sell-through of reserved inventory and stronger ASPs driven by strength in our commercial and gaming products in the quarter. DCAI revenue was $3.8 billion, ahead of our internal forecast. Despite continued unit TAM softness, the Xeon business was up sequentially, with MNC customers showing a better than seasonal recovery in the quarter. Favorable customer mix, along with strong adoption of newer products with higher core density, led to record Xeon ASPs in Q3. Despite sequential revenue decline, DCAI returned to profitability and contributed operating profit of $71 million, improving sequentially on better ASPs, reduced factory underload charges and continued spending discipline. Within DCAI, revenue for the Programmable Solutions Group declined mid-teens percent sequentially. As we discussed earlier this month, after a period of strong growth and tight supply, the FPGA business is entering a period of inventory burn. We expect PSG to decline in Q4 and be depressed for the next few quarters as customers work through inventory before returning to a more normalized run rate and growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% sequentially. Edge markets showed signs of recovery in Q3, leading NEX revenue to exceed our expectations. Network and telco markets continue to work through elevated inventory and weak demand, which we expect to persist through the end of the year. NEX also returned to profitability in Q3 with operating profit of $17 million, up $200 million sequentially on stronger revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $311 million, growing 4 times year-over-year and 34% sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS tools. IFS operating loss was $86 million as ramping factory and operating expenses offset stronger revenue in the period. Mobileye continues to perform well. Q3 revenue was $530 million, up 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, with operating profit of $107 million on a consolidated basis, up 32% sequentially. This morning, Mobileye increased their fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 7% at the midpoint. Q3 represented another outstanding quarter of cross-company spending discipline and focused portfolio management with operating expenses down 15% year-over-year. While we're on track to achieve $3 billion of total spending reductions in 2023, we expect sequentially higher OpEx in Q4 due to seasonal marketing activities, higher profit-dependent compensation and the end of some temporary austerity measures taken earlier in the year. We also had a onetime credit in Q3 associated with an asset sale, which will impact the sequential comparison in Q4. Now turning to Q4 guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $14.6 billion to $15.6 billion, delivering on our January commitment to grow revenue sequentially throughout 2023. In the client business, we're encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles as our channel checks, partner feedback and ASPs all point to healthy inventory levels and growing demand. We expect moderate sequential growth from DCAI, with Xeon's strength more than offsetting a decline in PSG and continued recovery in edge markets roughly offsetting persistent network weakness. At the revenue midpoint of $15.1 billion, we expect gross margin to flow through at approximately 60% of revenue growth, resulting in Q4 gross margin of approximately 46.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.44. We continue to operate under our Smart Capital framework. In Q3, we received a capital grant from the State of Ohio and our first foundry prepay. In addition, we continue to work with the U.S. CHIPS Office on their review of our four U.S. applications. And we continue to work with Germany, Poland and the European Commission on our planned expansions in Europe. There are no changes to our prior forecast of mid-30s percent net capital intensity across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate. Capital offsets will trend towards the higher end of our 20% to 30% range in that time frame, though we do expect the vast majority of those offsets to land in 2024. In closing, Q3 was Intel's strongest quarter since we began our transformation. We achieved significant milestones toward regaining process leadership on Intel 18A, delivered Meteor Lake and Emerald Rapids on time, secured multiple wafer and advanced packaging foundry customers and delivered another quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. We will continue to make significant investments as we execute the IDM 2.0 strategy, and we remain confident and committed to our long-term financial targets. We're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market. We're steadily closing structural cost gaps, and we continue to make progress toward delivering the financial returns that we and our owners expect. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Yes. Well, let me just -- if you don't mind, let me step back. I want to talk a little bit about Q3 for a second because Q3, I was really proud of the team's performance in terms of gross margins for Q3 coming in just shy of 46%. It was great execution in terms of spending from the team. They also did work on the underloading, which helped, and we were able to sell through some previously reserved inventory, and so that really helped propel the gross margin. So we had phenomenal fall-through in the third quarter. I'd say fourth quarter, we start to go back to what would be more of our typical fall-through range, somewhat muted by the fact that we are still going through 5 nodes in 4 years. There is spend associated with that, which kind of mutes us. So we're probably a little bit higher normally in terms of fall-through, but with that, it's probably like a 60% fall-through. That's kind of the normal range we think of, and that's what we're guiding for the fourth quarter. Beyond that, we'll save the rest of the commentary for next year when we close out '23. I would just say just on a longer-term basis, Pat has talked a lot about gross margins of 60%. And I feel like we are even more confident around our ability to hit that 60% threshold for a number of reasons. One, the execution that Pat talked about on five nodes in four years. When we get through that, of course, we eliminate the headwind on margins, but it turns around to a tailwind because when you're a process leader, you get better gross margins. Also as product execution improves, that also as we launch the products that are competitive in the marketplace. And we've seen that already in the client space, that helps on the gross margin side. But then more importantly, maybe the thing that's near and dear to my heart is this internal foundry model that we've built, where we're now measuring the manufacturing and TD organization as a separate P&L. We'll officially do that next year and we'll segment report it that way. But we're already this year starting to look at it that way in operations reviews. We're starting to do the planning for next year in that -- with that lens. We're doing the long-term plan in that lens. And all the things that we thought we would see in the dialogue between those functions, we're already starting to see now. We see the product organizations already starting to optimize around test times, around stepping, around how many samples and hot lots they do in the fab. Suddenly, things they didn't spend a lot of time thinking about before, they care a lot about now. And we're already starting to see improvements in the P&L because of that. On the same front, in manufacturing, they're now really, really worried about loadings. They're worried about a P&L. They want to drive the most revenue they can in their P&L, try to drive the cost down as much as possible. So I just think that we will see a lot of opportunities as we progress through '24 and beyond that are really going to make an impact on gross margins and give us a lot of confidence around this 60%. Yes. So again, back to the pride thing, I'm really proud of what we did in the third quarter and really what we've been able to execute for the year on that spend reduction. There was a lot of work associated with that. We had to drive a lot of, obviously, efficiency. But more importantly, as Pat talked about, we kind of end of -- or we took 10 programs or product areas and either divested of them or closed them out in an effort to improve our spending. And as we see -- and in addition to that, I would say that we also looked at businesses where we thought we could dramatically unlock value. And we think we've done the three areas that we thought most likely unlock value. So I think from that perspective, we feel we're pretty done with the activities associated with spending. And so that said, we are -- we do think we'll see benefit from our internal foundry model not only on the cost side but also on the OpEx side. And so that's the area that we'll focus over the long-term in terms of managing spending. And ultimately, the goal is to get to 60% gross margins but it's also to get to 40% operating margins. So that does entail driving efficiency in OpEx and we think there's plenty of opportunity. I'd say the same thing on OpEx that I said on gross margins. We'll save the fourth quarter -- or the \u201824 visibility for \u201824 when we close out \u201823. I'd just add one other thing. When we track the linearity of shipments, linearity was really, really good in the third quarter, and it's off to a really good start for the fourth quarter. And generally, when you see really steady shipment across the entire quarter, that's a good sign that you kind of balanced out the inventory and you're really just kind of shipping in what's shipping out. Yes. I'd say I think the first thing to kind of improve the gross margins is going to be around getting ourselves finally to process leadership and getting the products completely, as Pat was talking about, the product road map improving significantly, getting to the -- to where we have definitive leadership across all products. I think those two things will drive a significant lift on the gross margins, irrespective of anything else we have on the business front. And then when I look at, as I talked about this internal foundry model, I just think there's so much low-hanging fruit on the cost side, both in the business units and also in the manufacturing TD are kind of internal foundry business, that there's significant improvement that we can make on gross margins. Yes, mix does have an impact on the business, and we have a wide range of products that will have different margins. But almost all of them are punching below their weight right now. And as we improve all of them, that should lift the gross margins meaningfully over time. Yes. Maybe I'll start. Pat, feel free to chime in. Obviously, it was, I think, pretty important for us to show profitability this quarter. That was one of Pat and I's goals written on a sheet of paper that we wanted to see this business return to profitability. That said, it's making a lot of investments right now to improve the product portfolio on the CPU side and make the investments necessary on the AI front. But this business longer term should have margins that are very similar to margins you see from its peers when they are operating at healthy levels of margins. And so we have a lot of work to do to get there but I think the path is pretty clear. And of course, ASP will be a component of that but there's a lot of efficiencies that you can drive beyond just ASPs that will improve the margins longer term. Yes. I mean, it was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. But we'll be kind of dealing with this underload hangover, I'd call it, probably all through next year as we kind of progress, largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis, we'll still have all of that underload kind of tied up in the cost of the wafers in inventory, and that still has to get flushed through before we're completely done. So meaningful improvement. I'd say we have -- we're largely out of the woods but still some wood to chop through next year to where we're completely clean in underload."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today\u2019s discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our discussion also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations, where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong second quarter results exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating continued financial improvement and confirmation of our strategy in the marketplace. Effective execution across our process and product road maps is rebuilding customer confidence in Intel. Strength in client and data center and our efforts to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the organization all contributed to the upside in the quarter and a return to profitability. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic road map, achieving our long-term goals and maximizing shareholder value. In Q2, we began to see real benefits from our accelerating AI opportunity. We believe we are in a unique position to drive the best possible TCO for our customers at every node on the AI continuum. Our strategy is to democratize AI, scaling it and making it ubiquitous across the full continuum of workloads and usage models. We are championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client across data prep, training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. As we have previously outlined, AI is 1 of our 5 superpowers along with pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, cloud to edge infrastructure and sensing, underpinning a $1 trillion semi industry by 2030. Intel Foundry Services, or IFS, positions us to further capitalize on the AI market opportunity as well as the growing need for a secure, diversified and resilient global supply chain. IFS is a significant accelerant to our IDM 2.0 strategy, and every day of geopolitical tension reinforces the correctness of our strategy. IFS expands our scale, accelerates our ramps at the leading edge and creates long tails at the trailing edge. More importantly for our customers, it provides choice, leading edge capacity outside of Asia and at 18A and beyond, what we believe will deliver leadership performance. We are executing well on our Intel 18A as a key foundry offering and continue to make substantial progress against our strategy. In addition, in July, we announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman will join the RAMP-C program along with IBM, Microsoft and NVIDIA. The Rapid Assurance Microelectronics Prototypes-Commercial or RAMP-C, is a program created by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2021 to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors, specifically by establishing and demonstrating a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A. RAMP-C continues to build on recent customer and partner announcements by IFS, including MediaTek, ARM and a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider. We also made good progress on two significant 18A opportunities this quarter. We are strategically investing in manufacturing capacity to further advance our IDM 2.0 strategy and overarching foundry ambitions while adhering to our Smart Capital strategy. In Q2, we announced an expanded investment to build two leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Germany as well as plans for a new assembling and test facility in Poland. The building out of Silicon Junction in Magdeburg is an important part of our go-forward strategy. And with our investment in Poland and the Ireland sites, we already operate at scale in the region. We are encouraged to see the passage of the EU Chips bill supporting our building out an unrivaled capacity corridor in Europe. In addition, a year after being signed into law, we submitted our first application for U.S. CHIPS funding for the on-track construction of our fab expansion in Arizona, working closely with the U.S. Department of Commerce. It all starts with our process and product road maps, and I am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule. We remain on track to 5 nodes in 4 years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Looking specifically at each node, Intel 7 is done and with the second half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node is essentially complete with production ramping. For the remaining 3 nodes, I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, released PDK 1.1 and is on track for overall yield and performance targets. We will launch Sierra Forest in first half \u201824 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter, our lead vehicles for Intel 3. On Intel 20A, our first node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia, Arrow Lake, a volume client product is currently running its first stepping in the fab. In Q2, we announced that we will be the first to implement backside power delivery in silicon 2-plus years ahead of the industry, enabling power savings, area efficiency and performance gains for increased compute demands ideal for use cases like AI, CPUs and graphics. In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own products but even more so for our foundry customers. On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external test chips and remain on track to being manufacturing-ready in the second half of 2024. Just this week, we were pleased to have announced an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on their next-generation optimized 5G infrastructure. Reinforcing customer confidence in our road map, Ericsson will be utilizing Intel\u2019s 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC offerings. Moving to products. Our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well, seeing a modest recovery in the consumer and education segments as well as strength in premium segments where we have leadership performance. We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels. As we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives, we see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized. Importantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and Wi-Fi in the early 2000s. And we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity. In addition, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across most regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels. Building on strong demand for our 13th Gen Intel processor family, Meteor Lake is ramping well in anticipation of a Q3 PRQ and will maintain and extend our performance leadership in share gains over the last 4 quarters. Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client processor road map as the first PC platform built on Intel 4, our first EUV node and the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power, efficiency and graphics performance. Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine, Intel AI Boost. With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU, enabling dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life through key experience as people will want a need for hybrid work, productivity, sensing, security and creator capabilities, many of which were previewed at Microsoft\u2019s Build 2023 Conference. Finally, while making the decision to end direct investment in our Next Unit of Computing or NUC business, this well-regarded brand will continue to scale effectively with our recently announced ASUS partnership. In the data center, our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processor is showing strong customer demand despite the mixed overall market environment. I am pleased to say that we are poised to ship our 1 millionth 4th Gen Xeon unit in the coming days. This quarter, we also announced the general availability of 4th Gen Cloud Instances by Google Cloud. We also saw great progress with 4th Gen AI acceleration capabilities, and we now estimate more than 25% of Xeon data center shipments are targeted for AI workloads. Also in Q2, we saw a third-party validation from MLCommons when they published MLPerf training performance benchmark data showing that 4th Gen Xeon and Habana Gaudi2 are two strong open alternatives in the AI market that compete on both performance and price versus the competition. End-to-end AI-infused applications like DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold and algorithm areas such as Graph Neural Networks show our 4th Gen Xeon outperforming other alternatives, including the best published GPU results. Our strengthening positioning within the AI market was reinforced by our recent announcement of our collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade, secure and responsible generative AI, leveraging our Gaudi and 4th Gen Xeon offerings to unlock business value while maintaining high levels of security and data privacy. Our data center CPU road map continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule with Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable set to launch in Q4 of \u201823. Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will launch in the first half of \u201824. Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter. For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule. Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards and silicon is hitting all power and performance targets. Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A. While we performed ahead of expectations, the Q2 consumption TAM for servers remained soft on persistent weakness across all segments but particularly in the enterprise and rest of world where the recovery is taking longer than expected across the entire industry. We see the server CPU inventory digestion persisting in the second half, additionally, impacted by the near-term wallet share focus on AI accelerators rather than general purpose compute in the cloud. We expect Q3 server CPUs to modestly decline sequentially before recovering in Q4. Longer term, we see AI as TAM expansive to server CPUs and more importantly, we see our accelerated product portfolio is well positioned to gain share in 2024 and beyond. The surging demand for AI products and services is expanding the pipeline of business engagements for our accelerator products, which includes our Gaudi Flex and Max product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion\u2019s share. The value of our AI products is demonstrated by the public instances of Gaudi at AWS and the new commitments to our Gaudi product line from leading AI companies such as Hugging Face and Stability AI in addition to emerging AI leaders, including Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Pravartak [ph] and Genesis Cloud. In addition to building near-term momentum with our family of accelerators, we continue to make key advancements in next-generation technologies, which present significant opportunities for Intel. In Q2, we shipped our test chip, Tunnel Falls, a 12-cubit silicon-based quantum chip which uniquely leverages decades of transistor design and manufacturing investments and expertise. Tunnel Falls fabrication achieved 95% yield rate with voltage uniformity similar to chips manufactured under the more usual CMOS process, with a single 300-millimeter wafer providing 24,000 quantum dot test chips. We strongly believe our silicon approach is the only path to true cost-effective commercialization of quantum computing, a silicon-based cubit approach is 1 million times smaller than alternative approaches. Turning to PSG, NEX and Mobileye, demand trends are relatively stronger across our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure. Although as anticipated, NEX did see a Q2 inventory correction, which we expect to continue into Q3. In contrast, PSG, IFS and Mobileye continue on a solid growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year \u201823, much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digit decline in the semiconductor market, excluding memory. Looking specifically at our Programmable Solutions Group, we delivered record results for a third consecutive quarter. In Q2, we announced the Intel Agilex 7 with the R-Tile chiplet is shipping production qualified devices in volume to help customers accelerate workloads with seamless integration and the highest bandwidth processor interfaces. We have now PRQed 11 of the 15 new products we expected to bring to market in calendar year \u201823. For NEX, during Q2, Intel, Ericsson and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry\u2019s first vRAN solution running on the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor with Intel vRAN Boost. In addition, we will enhance the collaboration we announced at Mobile World Congress to accelerate industry-scale open RAN, utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Mobileye continued to generate strong profitability in Q2 and demonstrated impressive traction with their advanced product portfolio by announcing a supervision eyes-on hands-off design win with Porsche and the mobility-as-a-service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing in Austin, Texas. We continue to drive technical and commercial engagement with them, co-developing leading FMCW, LiDAR products based on Intel silicon photonics technology and partnering to drive the software-defined automobile vision that integrates Mobileye\u2019s ADAS technology with Intel\u2019s Cockpit offerings. Additionally, in the second quarter, we executed the secondary offering that generated meaningful proceeds as we continue to optimize our value creation efforts. In addition to executing on our process and product road maps during the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025. As mentioned during our internal foundry webinar, our new operating model establishes a separate P&L for our manufacturing group, inclusive of IFS and TD, which enables us to facilitate and accelerate our efforts to drive best-in-class cost structure, derisk our technology for external foundry customers and fundamentally changes incentives to drive incremental efficiencies. We have already identified numerous gains in efficiency, including factory loading, test and sort time reduction, packaging cost improvements, litho field utilization improvements, reductions in staffing, expedites and many more. It is important to underscore the inherent sustained value creation due to the tight connection between our business units and TD, manufacturing and IFS. Finally, as we continue to optimize our portfolio, we agreed to sell a minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business to Bain Capital who brings a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. IMS has created a significant market position with multi-beam mask writing tools that are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV technology and is already providing benefit on our 5 nodes, 4 years efforts. Further, this capability becomes even more critical with the adoption of high NA EUV in the second half of the decade. As we continue to keep Moore\u2019s Law alive and very well, IMS is a hidden gem within Intel, and the business\u2019s growth will be exposed and accelerated through this transaction. While we still have work to do, we continue to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy. 5 nodes in 4 years remains well on track, our product execution and road map is progressing well. We continue to build out our foundry business, and we are seeing early signs of success as we work to truly democratize AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client. We also saw strong momentum on our financial discipline and cost savings as we return to profitability, are executing our internal foundry model by 2024, and are leveraging our Smart Capital strategy to effectively and efficiently position us for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove stronger than expected business results in the second quarter, comfortably beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. While we expect continued improvement to global macroeconomic conditions, the pace of recovery remains moderate. We will continue to focus on what we can control, prioritizing investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively managing expenses near term, and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. Second quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, more than $900 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations in CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye, partially offset by continued demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets, which impacted NEX results. Gross margin was 39.8%, 230 basis points better than guidance on stronger revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.13, beating guidance by $0.17 as our revenue strength, better gross margin and disciplined OpEx management resulted in a return to profitability. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up $4.6 billion sequentially. Net inventory was reduced by $1 billion or 18 days in the quarter, and accounts receivable declined by $850 million or 7 days as we continue to focus on disciplined cash management. Net CapEx was $5.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Our actions in the last few weeks, the completed secondary offering of Mobileye shares, and the upcoming investment in our IMS Nanofabrication business by Bain Capital will generate more than $2.4 billion of cash and help to unlock roughly $35 billion of shareholder value. These actions further bolster our strong balance sheet and investment-grade profile with cash and short-term investments of more than $24 billion exiting Q2. We\u2019ll continue to focus on avenues to generate shareholder value from our broad portfolio of assets in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy. Moving to second quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the quarter as the pace of customer inventory burn slowed. As anticipated, we see the market moving toward equilibrium and expect shipments to more closely align to consumption in the second half. ASPs declined modestly in the quarter due to higher education shipments and sell-through of older inventory. CCG showed outstanding execution in Q2, generating operating profit of $1 billion, an improvement of more than $500 million sequentially on higher revenue, improved unit costs and reduced operating expenses, offsetting the impact of pre-PRQ inventory reserves in preparation for the second half launch of Meteor Lake. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, ahead of expectations and up 8% sequentially, with the Xeon business up double digits sequentially. Data center CPU TAM contracted meaningfully in the first half of \u201823. And while we expect the magnitude of year-over-year declines to diminish in the second half, a slower-than-anticipated TAM recovery in China and across enterprise markets has delayed a return of CPU TAM growth. CPU market share remained relatively stable in Q2 and the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids contributed to CPU ASP improvement of 3% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. DCAI had an operating loss of $161 million, improving sequentially on higher revenue and ASPs and reduced operating expenses. Within DCAI, our FPGA products delivered a third consecutive quarter of record revenue, up 35% year-over-year, along with another record quarterly operating margin. We expect this business to return to more natural demand profile in the second half of the year as we work down customer backlog to normalized levels. NEX revenue was $1.4 billion, below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 \u201822. Network and edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels. Elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses. Mobileye continued to perform well in Q2. Revenue was $454 million, roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year with operating profit improving sequentially to $129 million. This morning, Mobileye increased fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 9% at the midpoint. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $232 million, up 4x year-over-year and nearly doubling sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools. Operating loss was $143 million with higher factory start-up costs offsetting stronger revenue. Q2 was another strong quarter of cross-company spending discipline with operating expenses down 14% year-over-year. We\u2019re on track to achieve $3 billion of spending reductions in \u201823. With the decision to stop direct investment in our client NUC business earlier this month, we have now exited 9 lines of business since Pat rejoined the Company with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion. Through focused investment prioritization and austerity measures in the first half of the year, some of which are temporary in nature, OpEx is tracking a couple of hundred million dollars better than our $19.6 billion \u201823 committed goal. Now turning to Q3 guidance. We expect third quarter revenue of $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion. At the midpoint of $13.4 billion, we expect client CPU shipments to more closely match sell-through. Data center, network and edge markets continue to face mixed macro signals and elevated inventory levels in the third quarter, while IFS and Mobileye are well positioned to generate strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 43%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. We expect sequential margin improvement on higher sales and lower pre-PRQ inventory reserves. While we\u2019re starting to see some improvement in factory under load charges, most of the benefit will take some time to run through inventory and positively impact cost of sales. Investment in manufacturing capacity continues to be guided by our Smart Capital framework, creating flexibility through proactive investment in shells and aligning equipment purchases to customer demand. In the last few weeks, we have closed agreements with governments in Poland and Germany, which include significant capital incentives, and we\u2019re well positioned to meet the requirements of funding laid out by the U.S. CHIPS Act. Looking at capital requirements and offsets made possible by our Smart Capital strategy, we expect net capital intensity in the mid-30s as a percentage of revenue across \u201823 and \u201824 in aggregate. While our expectations for gross CapEx have not changed, the timing of some capital assets is uncertain and could land in either \u201823 or \u201824, depending on a number of factors. Having said that, we\u2019re confident in the level of capital offsets we will receive over the next 18 months and expect offsets to track to the high end of our previous range of 20% to 30%. Our financial results in Q2 reflect improved execution and improving macro conditions. Despite a slower-than-expected recovery in key consumption markets like China and the enterprise, we maintain our forecast of sequential revenue growth throughout the year. Accelerating AI use cases will drive increased demand for compute across the AI continuum, and Intel is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in each of our business units. We remain focused on the execution of our near- and long-term product, process and financial commitments and the prioritization of our owner\u2019s capital to generate free cash flow and create value for our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our earnings presentation. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question with a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we have the first caller please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to focus, Pat, on the data center, the DCAI side of things. Strong upside in the quarter but it sounds like there\u2019s still some mix trends going forward. So, I guess a two-part question. Can you talk about what drove the upside and where the concern is going forward? And part of that concern, that crowding out potential that you just discussed with, accelerators versus CPUs, how is that playing out and when do you expect it to end?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ross, and thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I\u2019m super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter, top, bottom line, beats, raise, just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as road map execution. With regard to the data center, obviously, the good execution, I\u2019ll just say we executed well, winning designs, fighting hard in the market, regaining our momentum, good execution. As you said, we\u2019ll see the Sapphire Rapids at the 1 millionth unit in the next couple of days, our Xeon Gen 4. So overall, it\u2019s feeling good. Road map\u2019s in very good shape, so we\u2019re feeling very good about the future outlook of the business as well. As we look to 5th Gen E-core, P-core with Sapphire and Granite Rapids, so all of those, I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re performing well. That said, we do think that the next quarter, at least, will show some softness. There\u2019s some inventory burn that we\u2019re still working through. We do see that big cloud customers, in particular, have put a lot of energy into building out their high-end AI training environments. And that is putting more of their budgets focused or prioritized into the AI portion of their build-out. That said, we do think this is a near term, right, surge that we expect will balance over time. We see AI as a workload, not as a market, right, which will affect every aspect of the business, whether it\u2019s client, whether it\u2019s edge, whether it\u2019s standard data center, on-premise enterprise or cloud. We\u2019re also seeing that Gen 4 Xeon, and we\u2019ll be enhancing that in the future road map has significant AI capabilities. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we expect about 25% today and growing of our Gen 4 is being driven by AI use cases. And obviously, we\u2019re going to be participating more in the accelerator portion of the market with our Gaudi, Flex and MAX product lines. Particularly, Gaudi is gaining a lot of momentum. In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter. So, we\u2019re going to participate in the accelerator portion of it. We\u2019re seeing real opportunity for the CPU as that workload balances over time between CPU and accelerator. And obviously, we have a strong position to democratize AI across our entire portfolio of products.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?\nRoss Seymore: I do. I just want to pivot to Dave on a question on the gross margin side. Nice beat in the quarter and the sequential increase for the third quarter as well. Beyond the revenue increase side, which I know is important, can you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses sequentially into the third quarter and even into the back half, some of the pre-PRQ reversals under utilization? Any of those kind of idiosyncratic blocks that we should be aware of as we think about the gross margin in the second half of the year?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question, Ross. So in the second quarter, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly and we got a good fall-through, given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we do, obviously, at the midpoint, see revenue growth sequentially. And so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect, again, pretty good fall-through as we get that incremental revenue. We\u2019re also going to see underloadings come down, I would say, modestly come down for two reasons: one, we get that period charge for some of our underloading, but some of our underloading is actually just a function of the cost of the inventory. And so that takes some time to flow through. So, it will be more -- it will be a modest decline but nevertheless helpful on the gross margin front. And then as you point out, we will have pre-PRQ reserves in the third quarter but they\u2019re meaningfully down from the second quarter. Meteor Lake will not be a pre-PRQ reserve in the third quarter because we expect to launch that this quarter. But we have Emerald Rapids, that will certainly have some impact and then some of the other SKUs will also impact it. So, coming down but not to zero. So we have an opportunity actually to perform better in the fourth quarter, obviously dependent on the revenue and so forth, given that pre-PRQ reserves are likely to come off again in the fourth quarter. We should improve on the loading front in the fourth quarter as well. So, there\u2019s some, I think, some good tailwinds on the gross margin front. I\u2019ll just take an opportunity to talk longer term. We will continue to be weighed down for some quarters on underload because of the nature of just having it cycle through inventory and then come out through cost of sales. So for multiple quarters, we\u2019ll have some underloading charges that we\u2019ll see. And then as we talked about for -- since really, Pat joined and we kind of launched into the 5 nodes in 4 years, we\u2019re going to have a significant amount of startup costs that will hit gross margins that will affect us for a couple of years. But we\u2019re really optimistic about where gross margins are going over the long term. Ultimately, we will get back to process parity and leadership and that will enable us to not have these start-up costs be a headwind. And of course, as you bring out products at a high performance in terms of process and in terms of product, that shows up in terms of our margins. And then, as Pat mentioned, he went through a laundry list in the prepared remarks of areas of benefit that the internal foundry model will give us. We expect a pretty meaningful amount of that to come out in -- by the time we hit 2026. But we won\u2019t be done there. I mean, I think there will be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin. So, Pat has talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think what we\u2019re seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P&L.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Dave, I think you said in your prepared remarks that data center pricing was up 17% year-on-year and that Sapphire Rapids was a factor there. Can you just talk to that? And kind of obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to get bigger. Can you talk about what you expect to see with platform cost in DCAI?\nDavid Zinsner: Platform costs, okay. Well, first of all, ASP is obviously improving as we increase core count and as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that\u2019s certainly helpful. Obviously, with the increase in core count, that affects the cost as well. So, cost obviously goes up. But the longer -- the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the start-up costs on 5 nodes in 4 years, which data center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think, longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get -- launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, that enables us to even be stronger in terms of our margin outlook and should help improve the overall P&L of data center.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up question?\nJoe Moore: Sure. Just also on servers, as you look to Q3, I think you talked about some of the cautious trends there. Can you talk to enterprise versus cloud? Is it different between the two? And also, do you see -- are you seeing anything different in China for data center versus what you\u2019re seeing in North America?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And as we said, Joe, -- thanks for the question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to be seeing the TAM down in Q3, somewhat driven by all of it. It\u2019s a little bit of data center digestion for the cloud guys, a bit of enterprise, so weakness, and some of that is more inventory. And the China market, I think, has been well reported, hasn\u2019t come back as strongly as people would have expected overall. And then the last factor was one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So, I think those four somewhat together, right, are leading to a bit of weakness, at least through Q3. That said, our overall position is strengthening and we\u2019re seeing our products improve, right? We\u2019re seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities and our Gen 4 and beyond products improving. We\u2019re also starting to see some of the use cases like Graph Neural Networks, Google\u2019s AlphaFold showing best results on CPUs as well, which is increasingly gaining momentum in the industry as people look for different aspects of data preparation, data processing, different innovations in AI. So all of that taken together, we feel optimistic about the long-term opportunities that we have in data center, and of course, the strengthening accelerator road map of Gaudi2, Gaudi3, Falcon Shores being now well executed. Also, our first wafers are in hand for Gaudi3. So, we see a lot of long-term optimism even as near term, we\u2019re working through some of the challenging environments of the market not being as strong as we would have hoped.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: I guess, first question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about AI being a TAM expander for servers. And I guess, I was hoping you could elaborate on that, given the productivity gains through acceleration, would love to hear why you think that will grow units, and particularly, if you could bifurcate your commentary across both training and inference.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And thanks, C.J. And generally, there are great analogies here that from history we point to. Cases like virtualization was going to destroy the CPU TAM and then ended up driving new workloads, right? If you think about a DGX platform, the leading edge AI platform, it includes CPUs, right? Why? Head nodes, data processing, data prep, dominate certain portions of the workload. We also see, as we said, AI as a workload where you might spend 10 megawatts and months training a model but then you\u2019re going to use it very broadly for inferencing. We do see with Meteor Lake ushering in the AI PC generation, where you have tens of watts being responding in a second or two. And then, AI is going to be in every hearing aid in the future, including mine, where it\u2019s 10 microwatts and instantaneous. So, we do see as AI drives workloads across the full spectrum of applications. And for that, we\u2019re going to build AI into every product that we build, whether it\u2019s a client, whether it\u2019s an edge platform for retail and manufacturing and industrial use cases, whether it\u2019s an enterprise data center where they\u2019re not going to stand up a dedicated 10-megawatt farm, but they\u2019re not going to move their private data off-premises, right, and use foundational models that are available in open source as well as in the big cloud and training environments as well. We firmly believe this idea of democratizing AI, opening the software stack, creating and participating with this broad industry ecosystem that\u2019s emerging. It was a great opportunity and one that Intel is well positioned to participate in. We\u2019ve seen that the AI TAM, right, is part of the semiconductor TAM. We\u2019ve always described this trillion-dollar semiconductor opportunity and AI being one of those superpowers, as I call it, of driving it. But it\u2019s not the only one and one that we\u2019re going to participate in broadly across our portfolio.\nJohn Pitzer: C.J., do you have a follow-up question?\nC.J. Muse: Yes, please. You talked a little bit about 18A and backside power. Would love to hear what you\u2019re seeing today in terms of both, scaling and power benefits and how your potential foundry customers are looking at that technology in particular.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And we continue to make good progress on our 5 nodes in 4 years. And with that, that culminates in 18A. And 18A is proceeding well and we got a particularly good response this quarter to PowerVia, the backside power that we believe is a couple of years ahead as the industry measures it against any other alternative in the industry. We\u2019re very affirmed by the Ericsson announcement, which is reinforcing the strong belief they have in 18A. But over and above that, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the two major significant opportunities that we made very good progress on as a big 18A foundry customers this quarter and an overall growing pipeline of potential foundry customers, test chips and process as well. So we feel 5 nodes in 4 years is on track. 18A is the culmination of that and good interest from the industry across the board. I\u2019d also say that as part of the overall strength in the foundry business as well and maybe tying the first part and the second part of your question together is that our packaging technologies are particularly interesting in the marketplace, an area that Intel never stumbled, right? This is an area of sustained leadership that we\u2019ve had. And today, many of the big AI machines are packaging limited. And because of that, we\u2019re finding a lot of interest for our advanced packaging, and this is an area of immediate strength for the foundry business. We set up a specific packaging business unit within our foundry business and finding a lot of great opportunities for us to pursue there as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: First, Dave, I had one for you. If I look at the third-party contributions, they were down a little bit, which was a little bit of a surprise. But you did say that the Arizona fab is on track. Can you sort of talk about that? And I know last quarter, you said gross CapEx would be first half weighted and the offsets would be back half weighted. Is that still the case?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So we did manage CapEx a bit better than I was hoping. We thought it would be more front-end loaded. It\u2019s looking -- look it\u2019s going to be a lot more evenly distributed first half versus the second half. And we managed CapEx in particular this quarter really well, which I think obviously helped on the free cash flow side. It\u2019s kind of a when you manage the CapEx, you get less offsets. And so that kind of drove the lower capital offsets for the quarter. But for the year, we\u2019re still on track to get the same amount of capital offsets through SCIP that we had anticipated. And that\u2019s really where most of the capital offsets have come so far. Now obviously, as we get into CHIPS incentives that should be coming here in the not-too-distant future, that will add to the offsets that we get. We go into next year, we start getting the investment tax credit that will help on the capital offsets. So, there\u2019ll be more things that come in the future. But right now, it\u2019s largely SCIP and it\u2019s SCIP1, and that\u2019s a function of where the spending lands quarter-to-quarter.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And just maybe to pile on to that a bit, obviously, getting EU Chips Act approved, we\u2019re excited about that for the Germany and Poland projects, which are -- will go for formal DG comp approval. We\u2019re also very happy, we submitted our first proposal, the on-track Arizona facility, but we\u2019ll have 3 more proposals going in for U.S. CHIPS Act this quarter. And so we\u2019re now at pace for those. So everything there is feeling exactly as we said it would and super happy with the great engagement, both in Europe as well as with the U.S. Department of Commerce as we\u2019re working on those application processes.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. Yes, Pat. So, you talked about an accelerated pipeline of more than $1 billion. And I think Sandra has been recently implying that you could do over $1 billion in Gaudi next year. So, the question is, is that the commitment? And then also at the Data Center Day, you had talked about merging the GPU and the Gaudi road maps into Falcon Shores but that\u2019s not going to come out until 2025. So, the question really there is wondering where that leaves customers in terms of their commitment to your road map, given those changes.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And let me take that and Dave can add. Overall, as we said, the accelerator pipeline is now well over $1 billion and growing rapidly, about 6x this past quarter. That\u2019s led by but not exclusively Gaudi but also includes the Max and Flex product lines as well. But the lion\u2019s share of that is Gaudi. Gaudi2 is shipping volume product today. Gaudi3 will be the volume product for next year and then Falcon Shores in \u201825, and we\u2019re already working on Falcon Shores 2 for \u201826. So, we have a simplified road map as we bring together our GPU and our accelerators into a single offering. But the progress that we\u2019re making with Gaudi2, it becomes more generalized with Gaudi3, the software stack, our One API approach that we\u2019re taking will give customers confidence that they have forward compatibility into Gaudi3 and Falcon Shores. And we\u2019ll just be broadening the flexibility of that software stack. We\u2019re adding FP8. We just added PyTorch 2 support. So every step along the way, it gets better and broader use cases. More language models are being supported. More programmability is being supported in the software stack. And we\u2019re building that full, right, solution set as we deliver on the best of GPU and the best of matrix acceleration in the Falcon Shores time line. But every step along the way, it just gets better. Every software release gets better. Every hardware release gets better along the way to cover more of the overall accelerator marketplace. And as I said, we now have Gaudi3 wafers. First ones are in hand, so that program is looking very good. And with this rapidly accelerating pipeline of opportunity, we expect that we\u2019ll be giving you very positive updates there in the future with both customers as well as expanded business opportunities.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research.\nBen Reitzes: Pat, you caught my attention with your comment about PCs next year or with AI having a Centrino moment. Do you mind just talking about that? And what -- when Centrino took place, it was very clear we unplugged from the wires and investors really grasped that. What is the aha moment with AI that\u2019s going to accelerate the client business and benefit Intel?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I think the real question is what applications are going to become AI-enabled? And today, you\u2019re starting to see that people are going to the cloud and goofing around with ChatGPT, writing a research paper and that\u2019s like super cool, right? And kids are, of course, simplifying their homework assignments that way. But you\u2019re not going to do that for every client becoming AI-enabled. It must be done on the client for that to occur, right? You can\u2019t go to the cloud. You can\u2019t round trip to the cloud. All of the new effects, real-time language translation in your Zoom calls, real-time transcription, automation, inferencing, relevance portraying, generated content and gaming environments, real-time creator environments being done through Adobes and others that are doing those as part of the client, new productivity tools being able to do local legal brief generations on clients, one after the other, right, across every aspect of consumer, of developer and enterprise efficiency use cases. We see that there\u2019s going to be a raft of AI enablement and those will be client-centered. Those will also be at the edge. You can\u2019t round trip to the cloud. You don\u2019t have the latency, the bandwidth or the cost structure to round trip, let\u2019s say, inferencing in a local convenience store to the cloud. It will all happen at the edge and at the client. So with that in mind, we do see this idea of bringing AI directly into the client immediately, right, which we\u2019re bringing to the market in the second half of the year, is the first major client product that includes native AI capabilities, the neural engine that we\u2019ve talked about. And this will be a volume delivery that we will have. And we expect that Intel is the volume leader for the client footprint, is the one that\u2019s going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge. And we do believe that this will become a driver of the TAM because people will say, \"Oh, I want those new use cases. They make me more efficient and more capable, just like Centrino made me more efficient because I didn\u2019t have to plug into the wire, right? Now, I don\u2019t have to go to the cloud to get these use cases. I\u2019m going to have them locally on my PC in real time and cost effective. We see this as a true AI PC moment that begins with Meteor Lake in the fall of this year.\nJohn Pitzer: Ben, do you have a follow-up question, please?\nBen Reitzes: Yes. I wanted to double click on your sequential guidance in the client business. There\u2019s some concerns out there with investors that there was some demand pull-in, in the second quarter, given some comments from some others. And just wanted to talk about your confidence for sequential growth in that business based on what you\u2019re seeing and if there was any more color there.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Let me start on that and Dave can jump in. The biggest change quarter-on-quarter that we see is that we\u2019re now at healthy inventory levels. And we worked through inventory Q4, Q1 and some in Q2. We now see the OEMs and the channel at healthy inventory levels. We continue to see solid demand signals for the client business from our OEMs and even some of the end-of-quarter and early quarter sell through are clear indicators of good strength in that business. And obviously, we combine that with gaining share again in Q2. So, we come into the second half of the year with good momentum and a very strong product line. So, we feel quite good about the client business outlook.\nDavid Zinsner: I\u2019d just add, normally over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve seen us identify in the 10-Q strategic sales that we\u2019ve made where we\u2019ve negotiated kind of attractive deals which have accelerated demand, let\u2019s call it. When you look at our 10-Q, which will either be filed late tonight or early tomorrow, you\u2019ll see that we don\u2019t have a number in there for this quarter, which is an indication of how little we did in terms of strategic purchases. So to your question of did we pull in demand, I think that\u2019ll probably give you a pretty good assessment of that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James.\nSrini Pajjuri: Pat, I have a question on AI as it relates to custom silicon. It\u2019s great to see that you announced a customer for 18A on custom silicon. But there\u2019s a huge demand, it seems like, for custom silicon on the AI front. I think some of your hyperscale customers are already successfully using custom silicon for -- as an AI accelerator. So, I\u2019m just curious what your strategy for that market is. Is that a focus area for you? If so, do you have any engagements with customers right now?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Srini. And the simple answer is yes, and I have multiple ways to play in this market. Obviously, one of those is foundry customers. We have a good pipeline of foundry customers for 18A, foundry opportunities. And several of those opportunities that we\u2019re investigating are exactly what you described, people looking to do their own unique versions of their AI accelerator components, and we\u2019re engaging with a number of those. But some of those are going to be variations of Intel standard products. And this is where the IDM 2.0 strength really comes to play where they could be using some of our silicon, combining it with some of their silicon designs. And given our advanced packaging strength, that gives us another way to be participating in those areas. And of course, that reinforces some of the near-term opportunities will just be packaging, right, where they already have designed with one of the other foundry, but we\u2019re going to be able to augment their capacity opportunities with immediately being able to engage with packaging opportunities and we\u2019re seeing pipeline of those opportunities. So overall, we agree that this is clearly going to be a market. We also see that some of the ones that you\u2019ve seen most in the press are about particularly high-end training environments. But as we said, we see AI being infused in everything. And there\u2019s going to be AI chips for the edge, AI chips for the communications infrastructure, AI chips for sensing devices, for automotive devices, and we see opportunities for us, both as a product provider and as a foundry and technology provider across that spectrum, and that\u2019s part of the unique positioning that IDM 2.0 gives us for the future.\nJohn Pitzer: Srini, do you have a follow-up question?\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, it\u2019s for Dave. Dave, it\u2019s good to see the progress on the working capital front. I think previously, you said your expectation is that free cash flow would turn positive sometime in second half. Just curious if that\u2019s still the expectation. And also, on the gross margin front, is there any, I guess, PRQ charges that we should be aware of as we go into fourth quarter?\nDavid Zinsner: Okay. So, let me just take a moment just to give the team credit on the second quarter in terms of working capital because we brought inventory down by $1 billion. Our days sales outstanding on the AR front is down to 24 days, which is exceptional. So, a lot of what you saw in terms of the improving free cash flow from Q1 to Q2 was working capital. So, I think the team has done an outstanding job just really focusing on all the elements that drive free cash flow. Our expectation is still by the end of the year to get to breakeven free cash flow. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t achieve that. Obviously, the net CapEx might be a little different this year than we thought coming into the year. But as we talked about, there\u2019s just a focus on free cash flow, the improved outlook in terms of the business. We think we can get to breakeven by the end of the year. As it relates to pre-PRQ reserves in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re likely to have some, but it should be a pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the third quarter, which was obviously a good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the second quarter.\nJohn Pitzer: Srini, thanks for the questions. Jonathan, I think we have time for one last caller, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today then comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: And I do have a quick follow-up as well. Just kind of going back to the gross margin a little bit. I think, Dave, when you guided this quarter, you talked about just looking backwards, the PRQ impact was going to be about 250 basis points. I think there was also an underload impact that I think you guided to around 300 basis points. So, I\u2019m just curious what was -- what were those numbers in this most recent quarter relative to kind of as we try and frame what the expectation is going forward?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, they were largely as expected, although it was off of a lower revenue number. So, the absolute dollars were as expected. They had a little bit of less of an impact, given the revenue was higher. And both of those numbers, like I said, will be lower in the third quarter.\nJohn Pitzer: Aaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\nAaron Rakers: I do, just real quickly on just kind of the AI narrative. We talked about Gaudi a lot in the pipeline build-out. I\u2019m curious as you look forward, as part of that pipeline, Pat, do you expect to see deployment in some of the hyperscale cloud guys and competing against directly some of the large competitors on the GPU front with Gaudi in cloud?\nPat Gelsinger: Simple answer. Yes. Right? And everyone is looking for alternatives. Clearly, the MLPerf numbers that we posted recently with Gaudi2 show very competitive numbers, significant TCO benefits for customers. They\u2019re looking for alternatives. They\u2019re also looking for more capacity. And so, we\u2019re definitely engaged. We already have Gaudi instances on AWS as available today already. And some of the names that we described in our earnings calls, Stability AI, Genesis Cloud. So, some of these are the proven, I\u2019ll say, at scale Tier 1 cloud providers but some of the next-generation ones are also engaging. So overall, absolutely, we expect that to be the case. We\u2019re also on our own dev cloud, we\u2019re making it easier for customers to test Gaudi more quickly. And with that, we now have 1,000 customers now who are taking advantage of the Intel Development Cloud. We\u2019re building a 1,000-node Gaudi cluster so that they can be at scale with their testing a very large training environment. So overall, the simple answer is, yes, very much so, and we\u2019re seeing a good pipeline of those opportunities.\nPat Gelsinger: So with that, let me just wrap up our time together today. Thank you. We\u2019re grateful that you would join us today, and we\u2019re thankful that we have the opportunity to update you on our business. And simply put, it was a very good quarter. We exceeded expectations on top line, on bottom line. We raised guidance and we look forward to the continue opportunities that we have of accelerating our business and seeing the margin improvement that comes in the second half of the year. But even more important to me was the operational improvements that we saw, a good fiscal discipline, cost saving discipline and best of all, the progress that we\u2019ve made, right, on our execution, our process execution, product execution, the transformational journey that we\u2019re in. And I just want to say a big thank you to my team for having a very good quarter that we could tell you about today. We look forward to talking to you more, particularly at our Innovation in September. We\u2019ll be hosting an investor Q&A track and we hope to see many, if not all of you there. It will be a great time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong second quarter results exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating continued financial improvement and confirmation of our strategy in the marketplace. Effective execution across our process and product road maps is rebuilding customer confidence in Intel. Strength in client and data center and our efforts to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the organization all contributed to the upside in the quarter and a return to profitability. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic road map, achieving our long-term goals and maximizing shareholder value. In Q2, we began to see real benefits from our accelerating AI opportunity. We believe we are in a unique position to drive the best possible TCO for our customers at every node on the AI continuum. Our strategy is to democratize AI, scaling it and making it ubiquitous across the full continuum of workloads and usage models. We are championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client across data prep, training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. As we have previously outlined, AI is 1 of our 5 superpowers along with pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, cloud to edge infrastructure and sensing, underpinning a $1 trillion semi industry by 2030. Intel Foundry Services, or IFS, positions us to further capitalize on the AI market opportunity as well as the growing need for a secure, diversified and resilient global supply chain. IFS is a significant accelerant to our IDM 2.0 strategy, and every day of geopolitical tension reinforces the correctness of our strategy. IFS expands our scale, accelerates our ramps at the leading edge and creates long tails at the trailing edge. More importantly for our customers, it provides choice, leading edge capacity outside of Asia and at 18A and beyond, what we believe will deliver leadership performance. We are executing well on our Intel 18A as a key foundry offering and continue to make substantial progress against our strategy. In addition, in July, we announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman will join the RAMP-C program along with IBM, Microsoft and NVIDIA. The Rapid Assurance Microelectronics Prototypes-Commercial or RAMP-C, is a program created by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2021 to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors, specifically by establishing and demonstrating a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A. RAMP-C continues to build on recent customer and partner announcements by IFS, including MediaTek, ARM and a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider. We also made good progress on two significant 18A opportunities this quarter. We are strategically investing in manufacturing capacity to further advance our IDM 2.0 strategy and overarching foundry ambitions while adhering to our Smart Capital strategy. In Q2, we announced an expanded investment to build two leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Germany as well as plans for a new assembling and test facility in Poland. The building out of Silicon Junction in Magdeburg is an important part of our go-forward strategy. And with our investment in Poland and the Ireland sites, we already operate at scale in the region. We are encouraged to see the passage of the EU Chips bill supporting our building out an unrivaled capacity corridor in Europe. In addition, a year after being signed into law, we submitted our first application for U.S. CHIPS funding for the on-track construction of our fab expansion in Arizona, working closely with the U.S. Department of Commerce. It all starts with our process and product road maps, and I am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule. We remain on track to 5 nodes in 4 years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Looking specifically at each node, Intel 7 is done and with the second half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node is essentially complete with production ramping. For the remaining 3 nodes, I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, released PDK 1.1 and is on track for overall yield and performance targets. We will launch Sierra Forest in first half \u201824 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter, our lead vehicles for Intel 3. On Intel 20A, our first node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia, Arrow Lake, a volume client product is currently running its first stepping in the fab. In Q2, we announced that we will be the first to implement backside power delivery in silicon 2-plus years ahead of the industry, enabling power savings, area efficiency and performance gains for increased compute demands ideal for use cases like AI, CPUs and graphics. In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own products but even more so for our foundry customers. On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external test chips and remain on track to being manufacturing-ready in the second half of 2024. Just this week, we were pleased to have announced an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on their next-generation optimized 5G infrastructure. Reinforcing customer confidence in our road map, Ericsson will be utilizing Intel's 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC offerings. Moving to products. Our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well, seeing a modest recovery in the consumer and education segments as well as strength in premium segments where we have leadership performance. We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels. As we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives, we see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized. Importantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and Wi-Fi in the early 2000s. And we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity. In addition, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across most regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels. Building on strong demand for our 13th Gen Intel processor family, Meteor Lake is ramping well in anticipation of a Q3 PRQ and will maintain and extend our performance leadership in share gains over the last 4 quarters. Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client processor road map as the first PC platform built on Intel 4, our first EUV node and the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power, efficiency and graphics performance. Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine, Intel AI Boost. With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU, enabling dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life through key experience as people will want a need for hybrid work, productivity, sensing, security and creator capabilities, many of which were previewed at Microsoft's Build 2023 Conference. Finally, while making the decision to end direct investment in our Next Unit of Computing or NUC business, this well-regarded brand will continue to scale effectively with our recently announced ASUS partnership. In the data center, our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processor is showing strong customer demand despite the mixed overall market environment. I am pleased to say that we are poised to ship our 1 millionth 4th Gen Xeon unit in the coming days. This quarter, we also announced the general availability of 4th Gen Cloud Instances by Google Cloud. We also saw great progress with 4th Gen AI acceleration capabilities, and we now estimate more than 25% of Xeon data center shipments are targeted for AI workloads. Also in Q2, we saw a third-party validation from MLCommons when they published MLPerf training performance benchmark data showing that 4th Gen Xeon and Habana Gaudi2 are two strong open alternatives in the AI market that compete on both performance and price versus the competition. End-to-end AI-infused applications like DeepMind's AlphaFold and algorithm areas such as Graph Neural Networks show our 4th Gen Xeon outperforming other alternatives, including the best published GPU results. Our strengthening positioning within the AI market was reinforced by our recent announcement of our collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade, secure and responsible generative AI, leveraging our Gaudi and 4th Gen Xeon offerings to unlock business value while maintaining high levels of security and data privacy. Our data center CPU road map continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule with Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable set to launch in Q4 of \u201823. Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will launch in the first half of \u201824. Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter. For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule. Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards and silicon is hitting all power and performance targets. Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A. While we performed ahead of expectations, the Q2 consumption TAM for servers remained soft on persistent weakness across all segments but particularly in the enterprise and rest of world where the recovery is taking longer than expected across the entire industry. We see the server CPU inventory digestion persisting in the second half, additionally, impacted by the near-term wallet share focus on AI accelerators rather than general purpose compute in the cloud. We expect Q3 server CPUs to modestly decline sequentially before recovering in Q4. Longer term, we see AI as TAM expansive to server CPUs and more importantly, we see our accelerated product portfolio is well positioned to gain share in 2024 and beyond. The surging demand for AI products and services is expanding the pipeline of business engagements for our accelerator products, which includes our Gaudi Flex and Max product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share. The value of our AI products is demonstrated by the public instances of Gaudi at AWS and the new commitments to our Gaudi product line from leading AI companies such as Hugging Face and Stability AI in addition to emerging AI leaders, including Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Pravartak [ph] and Genesis Cloud. In addition to building near-term momentum with our family of accelerators, we continue to make key advancements in next-generation technologies, which present significant opportunities for Intel. In Q2, we shipped our test chip, Tunnel Falls, a 12-cubit silicon-based quantum chip which uniquely leverages decades of transistor design and manufacturing investments and expertise. Tunnel Falls fabrication achieved 95% yield rate with voltage uniformity similar to chips manufactured under the more usual CMOS process, with a single 300-millimeter wafer providing 24,000 quantum dot test chips. We strongly believe our silicon approach is the only path to true cost-effective commercialization of quantum computing, a silicon-based cubit approach is 1 million times smaller than alternative approaches. Turning to PSG, NEX and Mobileye, demand trends are relatively stronger across our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure. Although as anticipated, NEX did see a Q2 inventory correction, which we expect to continue into Q3. In contrast, PSG, IFS and Mobileye continue on a solid growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year \u201823, much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digit decline in the semiconductor market, excluding memory. Looking specifically at our Programmable Solutions Group, we delivered record results for a third consecutive quarter. In Q2, we announced the Intel Agilex 7 with the R-Tile chiplet is shipping production qualified devices in volume to help customers accelerate workloads with seamless integration and the highest bandwidth processor interfaces. We have now PRQed 11 of the 15 new products we expected to bring to market in calendar year \u201823. For NEX, during Q2, Intel, Ericsson and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry's first vRAN solution running on the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor with Intel vRAN Boost. In addition, we will enhance the collaboration we announced at Mobile World Congress to accelerate industry-scale open RAN, utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable, software-defined infrastructure. Mobileye continued to generate strong profitability in Q2 and demonstrated impressive traction with their advanced product portfolio by announcing a supervision eyes-on hands-off design win with Porsche and the mobility-as-a-service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing in Austin, Texas. We continue to drive technical and commercial engagement with them, co-developing leading FMCW, LiDAR products based on Intel silicon photonics technology and partnering to drive the software-defined automobile vision that integrates Mobileye's ADAS technology with Intel's Cockpit offerings. Additionally, in the second quarter, we executed the secondary offering that generated meaningful proceeds as we continue to optimize our value creation efforts. In addition to executing on our process and product road maps during the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025. As mentioned during our internal foundry webinar, our new operating model establishes a separate P&L for our manufacturing group, inclusive of IFS and TD, which enables us to facilitate and accelerate our efforts to drive best-in-class cost structure, derisk our technology for external foundry customers and fundamentally changes incentives to drive incremental efficiencies. We have already identified numerous gains in efficiency, including factory loading, test and sort time reduction, packaging cost improvements, litho field utilization improvements, reductions in staffing, expedites and many more. It is important to underscore the inherent sustained value creation due to the tight connection between our business units and TD, manufacturing and IFS. Finally, as we continue to optimize our portfolio, we agreed to sell a minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business to Bain Capital who brings a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. IMS has created a significant market position with multi-beam mask writing tools that are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV technology and is already providing benefit on our 5 nodes, 4 years efforts. Further, this capability becomes even more critical with the adoption of high NA EUV in the second half of the decade. As we continue to keep Moore's Law alive and very well, IMS is a hidden gem within Intel, and the business's growth will be exposed and accelerated through this transaction. While we still have work to do, we continue to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy. 5 nodes in 4 years remains well on track, our product execution and road map is progressing well. We continue to build out our foundry business, and we are seeing early signs of success as we work to truly democratize AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client. We also saw strong momentum on our financial discipline and cost savings as we return to profitability, are executing our internal foundry model by 2024, and are leveraging our Smart Capital strategy to effectively and efficiently position us for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thanks, Ross, and thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I'm super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter, top, bottom line, beats, raise, just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as road map execution. With regard to the data center, obviously, the good execution, I'll just say we executed well, winning designs, fighting hard in the market, regaining our momentum, good execution. As you said, we'll see the Sapphire Rapids at the 1 millionth unit in the next couple of days, our Xeon Gen 4. So overall, it's feeling good. Road map's in very good shape, so we're feeling very good about the future outlook of the business as well. As we look to 5th Gen E-core, P-core with Sapphire and Granite Rapids, so all of those, I'll just say we're performing well. That said, we do think that the next quarter, at least, will show some softness. There's some inventory burn that we're still working through. We do see that big cloud customers, in particular, have put a lot of energy into building out their high-end AI training environments. And that is putting more of their budgets focused or prioritized into the AI portion of their build-out. That said, we do think this is a near term, right, surge that we expect will balance over time. We see AI as a workload, not as a market, right, which will affect every aspect of the business, whether it's client, whether it's edge, whether it's standard data center, on-premise enterprise or cloud. We're also seeing that Gen 4 Xeon, and we'll be enhancing that in the future road map has significant AI capabilities. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we expect about 25% today and growing of our Gen 4 is being driven by AI use cases. And obviously, we're going to be participating more in the accelerator portion of the market with our Gaudi, Flex and MAX product lines. Particularly, Gaudi is gaining a lot of momentum. In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter. So, we're going to participate in the accelerator portion of it. We're seeing real opportunity for the CPU as that workload balances over time between CPU and accelerator. And obviously, we have a strong position to democratize AI across our entire portfolio of products. Yes. And as we said, Joe, -- thanks for the question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to be seeing the TAM down in Q3, somewhat driven by all of it. It's a little bit of data center digestion for the cloud guys, a bit of enterprise, so weakness, and some of that is more inventory. And the China market, I think, has been well reported, hasn't come back as strongly as people would have expected overall. And then the last factor was one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So, I think those four somewhat together, right, are leading to a bit of weakness, at least through Q3. That said, our overall position is strengthening and we're seeing our products improve, right? We're seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities and our Gen 4 and beyond products improving. We're also starting to see some of the use cases like Graph Neural Networks, Google's AlphaFold showing best results on CPUs as well, which is increasingly gaining momentum in the industry as people look for different aspects of data preparation, data processing, different innovations in AI. So all of that taken together, we feel optimistic about the long-term opportunities that we have in data center, and of course, the strengthening accelerator road map of Gaudi2, Gaudi3, Falcon Shores being now well executed. Also, our first wafers are in hand for Gaudi3. So, we see a lot of long-term optimism even as near term, we're working through some of the challenging environments of the market not being as strong as we would have hoped. Yes. And thanks, C.J. And generally, there are great analogies here that from history we point to. Cases like virtualization was going to destroy the CPU TAM and then ended up driving new workloads, right? If you think about a DGX platform, the leading edge AI platform, it includes CPUs, right? Why? Head nodes, data processing, data prep, dominate certain portions of the workload. We also see, as we said, AI as a workload where you might spend 10 megawatts and months training a model but then you're going to use it very broadly for inferencing. We do see with Meteor Lake ushering in the AI PC generation, where you have tens of watts being responding in a second or two. And then, AI is going to be in every hearing aid in the future, including mine, where it's 10 microwatts and instantaneous. So, we do see as AI drives workloads across the full spectrum of applications. And for that, we're going to build AI into every product that we build, whether it's a client, whether it's an edge platform for retail and manufacturing and industrial use cases, whether it's an enterprise data center where they're not going to stand up a dedicated 10-megawatt farm, but they're not going to move their private data off-premises, right, and use foundational models that are available in open source as well as in the big cloud and training environments as well. We firmly believe this idea of democratizing AI, opening the software stack, creating and participating with this broad industry ecosystem that's emerging. It was a great opportunity and one that Intel is well positioned to participate in. We've seen that the AI TAM, right, is part of the semiconductor TAM. We've always described this trillion-dollar semiconductor opportunity and AI being one of those superpowers, as I call it, of driving it. But it's not the only one and one that we're going to participate in broadly across our portfolio. Yes. Thank you. And we continue to make good progress on our 5 nodes in 4 years. And with that, that culminates in 18A. And 18A is proceeding well and we got a particularly good response this quarter to PowerVia, the backside power that we believe is a couple of years ahead as the industry measures it against any other alternative in the industry. We're very affirmed by the Ericsson announcement, which is reinforcing the strong belief they have in 18A. But over and above that, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the two major significant opportunities that we made very good progress on as a big 18A foundry customers this quarter and an overall growing pipeline of potential foundry customers, test chips and process as well. So we feel 5 nodes in 4 years is on track. 18A is the culmination of that and good interest from the industry across the board. I'd also say that as part of the overall strength in the foundry business as well and maybe tying the first part and the second part of your question together is that our packaging technologies are particularly interesting in the marketplace, an area that Intel never stumbled, right? This is an area of sustained leadership that we've had. And today, many of the big AI machines are packaging limited. And because of that, we're finding a lot of interest for our advanced packaging, and this is an area of immediate strength for the foundry business. We set up a specific packaging business unit within our foundry business and finding a lot of great opportunities for us to pursue there as well. Yes. And just maybe to pile on to that a bit, obviously, getting EU Chips Act approved, we're excited about that for the Germany and Poland projects, which are -- will go for formal DG comp approval. We're also very happy, we submitted our first proposal, the on-track Arizona facility, but we'll have 3 more proposals going in for U.S. CHIPS Act this quarter. And so we're now at pace for those. So everything there is feeling exactly as we said it would and super happy with the great engagement, both in Europe as well as with the U.S. Department of Commerce as we're working on those application processes. Yes. And let me take that and Dave can add. Overall, as we said, the accelerator pipeline is now well over $1 billion and growing rapidly, about 6x this past quarter. That's led by but not exclusively Gaudi but also includes the Max and Flex product lines as well. But the lion's share of that is Gaudi. Gaudi2 is shipping volume product today. Gaudi3 will be the volume product for next year and then Falcon Shores in \u201825, and we're already working on Falcon Shores 2 for \u201826. So, we have a simplified road map as we bring together our GPU and our accelerators into a single offering. But the progress that we're making with Gaudi2, it becomes more generalized with Gaudi3, the software stack, our One API approach that we're taking will give customers confidence that they have forward compatibility into Gaudi3 and Falcon Shores. And we'll just be broadening the flexibility of that software stack. We're adding FP8. We just added PyTorch 2 support. So every step along the way, it gets better and broader use cases. More language models are being supported. More programmability is being supported in the software stack. And we're building that full, right, solution set as we deliver on the best of GPU and the best of matrix acceleration in the Falcon Shores time line. But every step along the way, it just gets better. Every software release gets better. Every hardware release gets better along the way to cover more of the overall accelerator marketplace. And as I said, we now have Gaudi3 wafers. First ones are in hand, so that program is looking very good. And with this rapidly accelerating pipeline of opportunity, we expect that we'll be giving you very positive updates there in the future with both customers as well as expanded business opportunities. Yes. And I think the real question is what applications are going to become AI-enabled? And today, you're starting to see that people are going to the cloud and goofing around with ChatGPT, writing a research paper and that's like super cool, right? And kids are, of course, simplifying their homework assignments that way. But you're not going to do that for every client becoming AI-enabled. It must be done on the client for that to occur, right? You can't go to the cloud. You can't round trip to the cloud. All of the new effects, real-time language translation in your Zoom calls, real-time transcription, automation, inferencing, relevance portraying, generated content and gaming environments, real-time creator environments being done through Adobes and others that are doing those as part of the client, new productivity tools being able to do local legal brief generations on clients, one after the other, right, across every aspect of consumer, of developer and enterprise efficiency use cases. We see that there's going to be a raft of AI enablement and those will be client-centered. Those will also be at the edge. You can't round trip to the cloud. You don't have the latency, the bandwidth or the cost structure to round trip, let's say, inferencing in a local convenience store to the cloud. It will all happen at the edge and at the client. So with that in mind, we do see this idea of bringing AI directly into the client immediately, right, which we're bringing to the market in the second half of the year, is the first major client product that includes native AI capabilities, the neural engine that we've talked about. And this will be a volume delivery that we will have. And we expect that Intel is the volume leader for the client footprint, is the one that's going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge. And we do believe that this will become a driver of the TAM because people will say, \"Oh, I want those new use cases. They make me more efficient and more capable, just like Centrino made me more efficient because I didn't have to plug into the wire, right? Now, I don't have to go to the cloud to get these use cases. I'm going to have them locally on my PC in real time and cost effective. We see this as a true AI PC moment that begins with Meteor Lake in the fall of this year. Yes. Let me start on that and Dave can jump in. The biggest change quarter-on-quarter that we see is that we're now at healthy inventory levels. And we worked through inventory Q4, Q1 and some in Q2. We now see the OEMs and the channel at healthy inventory levels. We continue to see solid demand signals for the client business from our OEMs and even some of the end-of-quarter and early quarter sell through are clear indicators of good strength in that business. And obviously, we combine that with gaining share again in Q2. So, we come into the second half of the year with good momentum and a very strong product line. So, we feel quite good about the client business outlook. Yes. Thank you, Srini. And the simple answer is yes, and I have multiple ways to play in this market. Obviously, one of those is foundry customers. We have a good pipeline of foundry customers for 18A, foundry opportunities. And several of those opportunities that we're investigating are exactly what you described, people looking to do their own unique versions of their AI accelerator components, and we're engaging with a number of those. But some of those are going to be variations of Intel standard products. And this is where the IDM 2.0 strength really comes to play where they could be using some of our silicon, combining it with some of their silicon designs. And given our advanced packaging strength, that gives us another way to be participating in those areas. And of course, that reinforces some of the near-term opportunities will just be packaging, right, where they already have designed with one of the other foundry, but we're going to be able to augment their capacity opportunities with immediately being able to engage with packaging opportunities and we're seeing pipeline of those opportunities. So overall, we agree that this is clearly going to be a market. We also see that some of the ones that you've seen most in the press are about particularly high-end training environments. But as we said, we see AI being infused in everything. And there's going to be AI chips for the edge, AI chips for the communications infrastructure, AI chips for sensing devices, for automotive devices, and we see opportunities for us, both as a product provider and as a foundry and technology provider across that spectrum, and that's part of the unique positioning that IDM 2.0 gives us for the future. Simple answer. Yes. Right? And everyone is looking for alternatives. Clearly, the MLPerf numbers that we posted recently with Gaudi2 show very competitive numbers, significant TCO benefits for customers. They're looking for alternatives. They're also looking for more capacity. And so, we're definitely engaged. We already have Gaudi instances on AWS as available today already. And some of the names that we described in our earnings calls, Stability AI, Genesis Cloud. So, some of these are the proven, I'll say, at scale Tier 1 cloud providers but some of the next-generation ones are also engaging. So overall, absolutely, we expect that to be the case. We're also on our own dev cloud, we're making it easier for customers to test Gaudi more quickly. And with that, we now have 1,000 customers now who are taking advantage of the Intel Development Cloud. We're building a 1,000-node Gaudi cluster so that they can be at scale with their testing a very large training environment. So overall, the simple answer is, yes, very much so, and we're seeing a good pipeline of those opportunities. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together today. Thank you. We're grateful that you would join us today, and we're thankful that we have the opportunity to update you on our business. And simply put, it was a very good quarter. We exceeded expectations on top line, on bottom line. We raised guidance and we look forward to the continue opportunities that we have of accelerating our business and seeing the margin improvement that comes in the second half of the year. But even more important to me was the operational improvements that we saw, a good fiscal discipline, cost saving discipline and best of all, the progress that we've made, right, on our execution, our process execution, product execution, the transformational journey that we're in. And I just want to say a big thank you to my team for having a very good quarter that we could tell you about today. We look forward to talking to you more, particularly at our Innovation in September. We'll be hosting an investor Q&A track and we hope to see many, if not all of you there. It will be a great time. Thank you."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove stronger than expected business results in the second quarter, comfortably beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. While we expect continued improvement to global macroeconomic conditions, the pace of recovery remains moderate. We will continue to focus on what we can control, prioritizing investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively managing expenses near term, and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. Second quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, more than $900 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations in CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye, partially offset by continued demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets, which impacted NEX results. Gross margin was 39.8%, 230 basis points better than guidance on stronger revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.13, beating guidance by $0.17 as our revenue strength, better gross margin and disciplined OpEx management resulted in a return to profitability. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up $4.6 billion sequentially. Net inventory was reduced by $1 billion or 18 days in the quarter, and accounts receivable declined by $850 million or 7 days as we continue to focus on disciplined cash management. Net CapEx was $5.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Our actions in the last few weeks, the completed secondary offering of Mobileye shares, and the upcoming investment in our IMS Nanofabrication business by Bain Capital will generate more than $2.4 billion of cash and help to unlock roughly $35 billion of shareholder value. These actions further bolster our strong balance sheet and investment-grade profile with cash and short-term investments of more than $24 billion exiting Q2. We'll continue to focus on avenues to generate shareholder value from our broad portfolio of assets in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy. Moving to second quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the quarter as the pace of customer inventory burn slowed. As anticipated, we see the market moving toward equilibrium and expect shipments to more closely align to consumption in the second half. ASPs declined modestly in the quarter due to higher education shipments and sell-through of older inventory. CCG showed outstanding execution in Q2, generating operating profit of $1 billion, an improvement of more than $500 million sequentially on higher revenue, improved unit costs and reduced operating expenses, offsetting the impact of pre-PRQ inventory reserves in preparation for the second half launch of Meteor Lake. DCAI revenue was $4 billion, ahead of expectations and up 8% sequentially, with the Xeon business up double digits sequentially. Data center CPU TAM contracted meaningfully in the first half of \u201823. And while we expect the magnitude of year-over-year declines to diminish in the second half, a slower-than-anticipated TAM recovery in China and across enterprise markets has delayed a return of CPU TAM growth. CPU market share remained relatively stable in Q2 and the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids contributed to CPU ASP improvement of 3% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. DCAI had an operating loss of $161 million, improving sequentially on higher revenue and ASPs and reduced operating expenses. Within DCAI, our FPGA products delivered a third consecutive quarter of record revenue, up 35% year-over-year, along with another record quarterly operating margin. We expect this business to return to more natural demand profile in the second half of the year as we work down customer backlog to normalized levels. NEX revenue was $1.4 billion, below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 \u201822. Network and edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels. Elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses. Mobileye continued to perform well in Q2. Revenue was $454 million, roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year with operating profit improving sequentially to $129 million. This morning, Mobileye increased fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 9% at the midpoint. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $232 million, up 4x year-over-year and nearly doubling sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools. Operating loss was $143 million with higher factory start-up costs offsetting stronger revenue. Q2 was another strong quarter of cross-company spending discipline with operating expenses down 14% year-over-year. We're on track to achieve $3 billion of spending reductions in \u201823. With the decision to stop direct investment in our client NUC business earlier this month, we have now exited 9 lines of business since Pat rejoined the Company with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion. Through focused investment prioritization and austerity measures in the first half of the year, some of which are temporary in nature, OpEx is tracking a couple of hundred million dollars better than our $19.6 billion \u201823 committed goal. Now turning to Q3 guidance. We expect third quarter revenue of $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion. At the midpoint of $13.4 billion, we expect client CPU shipments to more closely match sell-through. Data center, network and edge markets continue to face mixed macro signals and elevated inventory levels in the third quarter, while IFS and Mobileye are well positioned to generate strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We're forecasting gross margin of 43%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. We expect sequential margin improvement on higher sales and lower pre-PRQ inventory reserves. While we're starting to see some improvement in factory under load charges, most of the benefit will take some time to run through inventory and positively impact cost of sales. Investment in manufacturing capacity continues to be guided by our Smart Capital framework, creating flexibility through proactive investment in shells and aligning equipment purchases to customer demand. In the last few weeks, we have closed agreements with governments in Poland and Germany, which include significant capital incentives, and we're well positioned to meet the requirements of funding laid out by the U.S. CHIPS Act. Looking at capital requirements and offsets made possible by our Smart Capital strategy, we expect net capital intensity in the mid-30s as a percentage of revenue across \u201823 and \u201824 in aggregate. While our expectations for gross CapEx have not changed, the timing of some capital assets is uncertain and could land in either \u201823 or \u201824, depending on a number of factors. Having said that, we're confident in the level of capital offsets we will receive over the next 18 months and expect offsets to track to the high end of our previous range of 20% to 30%. Our financial results in Q2 reflect improved execution and improving macro conditions. Despite a slower-than-expected recovery in key consumption markets like China and the enterprise, we maintain our forecast of sequential revenue growth throughout the year. Accelerating AI use cases will drive increased demand for compute across the AI continuum, and Intel is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in each of our business units. We remain focused on the execution of our near- and long-term product, process and financial commitments and the prioritization of our owner's capital to generate free cash flow and create value for our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Yes. Good question, Ross. So in the second quarter, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly and we got a good fall-through, given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we do, obviously, at the midpoint, see revenue growth sequentially. And so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect, again, pretty good fall-through as we get that incremental revenue. We're also going to see underloadings come down, I would say, modestly come down for two reasons: one, we get that period charge for some of our underloading, but some of our underloading is actually just a function of the cost of the inventory. And so that takes some time to flow through. So, it will be more -- it will be a modest decline but nevertheless helpful on the gross margin front. And then as you point out, we will have pre-PRQ reserves in the third quarter but they're meaningfully down from the second quarter. Meteor Lake will not be a pre-PRQ reserve in the third quarter because we expect to launch that this quarter. But we have Emerald Rapids, that will certainly have some impact and then some of the other SKUs will also impact it. So, coming down but not to zero. So we have an opportunity actually to perform better in the fourth quarter, obviously dependent on the revenue and so forth, given that pre-PRQ reserves are likely to come off again in the fourth quarter. We should improve on the loading front in the fourth quarter as well. So, there's some, I think, some good tailwinds on the gross margin front. I'll just take an opportunity to talk longer term. We will continue to be weighed down for some quarters on underload because of the nature of just having it cycle through inventory and then come out through cost of sales. So for multiple quarters, we'll have some underloading charges that we'll see. And then as we talked about for -- since really, Pat joined and we kind of launched into the 5 nodes in 4 years, we're going to have a significant amount of startup costs that will hit gross margins that will affect us for a couple of years. But we're really optimistic about where gross margins are going over the long term. Ultimately, we will get back to process parity and leadership and that will enable us to not have these start-up costs be a headwind. And of course, as you bring out products at a high performance in terms of process and in terms of product, that shows up in terms of our margins. And then, as Pat mentioned, he went through a laundry list in the prepared remarks of areas of benefit that the internal foundry model will give us. We expect a pretty meaningful amount of that to come out in -- by the time we hit 2026. But we won't be done there. I mean, I think there will be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin. So, Pat has talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think what we're seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P&L. Platform costs, okay. Well, first of all, ASP is obviously improving as we increase core count and as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that's certainly helpful. Obviously, with the increase in core count, that affects the cost as well. So, cost obviously goes up. But the longer -- the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the start-up costs on 5 nodes in 4 years, which data center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think, longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get -- launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, that enables us to even be stronger in terms of our margin outlook and should help improve the overall P&L of data center. Yes. So we did manage CapEx a bit better than I was hoping. We thought it would be more front-end loaded. It's looking -- look it's going to be a lot more evenly distributed first half versus the second half. And we managed CapEx in particular this quarter really well, which I think obviously helped on the free cash flow side. It's kind of a when you manage the CapEx, you get less offsets. And so that kind of drove the lower capital offsets for the quarter. But for the year, we're still on track to get the same amount of capital offsets through SCIP that we had anticipated. And that's really where most of the capital offsets have come so far. Now obviously, as we get into CHIPS incentives that should be coming here in the not-too-distant future, that will add to the offsets that we get. We go into next year, we start getting the investment tax credit that will help on the capital offsets. So, there'll be more things that come in the future. But right now, it's largely SCIP and it's SCIP1, and that's a function of where the spending lands quarter-to-quarter. I'd just add, normally over the last few quarters, you've seen us identify in the 10-Q strategic sales that we've made where we've negotiated kind of attractive deals which have accelerated demand, let's call it. When you look at our 10-Q, which will either be filed late tonight or early tomorrow, you'll see that we don't have a number in there for this quarter, which is an indication of how little we did in terms of strategic purchases. So to your question of did we pull in demand, I think that'll probably give you a pretty good assessment of that. Okay. So, let me just take a moment just to give the team credit on the second quarter in terms of working capital because we brought inventory down by $1 billion. Our days sales outstanding on the AR front is down to 24 days, which is exceptional. So, a lot of what you saw in terms of the improving free cash flow from Q1 to Q2 was working capital. So, I think the team has done an outstanding job just really focusing on all the elements that drive free cash flow. Our expectation is still by the end of the year to get to breakeven free cash flow. There's no reason why we shouldn't achieve that. Obviously, the net CapEx might be a little different this year than we thought coming into the year. But as we talked about, there's just a focus on free cash flow, the improved outlook in terms of the business. We think we can get to breakeven by the end of the year. As it relates to pre-PRQ reserves in the fourth quarter, we're likely to have some, but it should be a pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the third quarter, which was obviously a good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the second quarter. Yes, they were largely as expected, although it was off of a lower revenue number. So, the absolute dollars were as expected. They had a little bit of less of an impact, given the revenue was higher. And both of those numbers, like I said, will be lower in the third quarter."

By now you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both, followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent Annual Report in Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC, provide more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPat Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid first-quarter results on both the top- and bottom-line. Upside was driven by better-than-expected revenue and very disciplined expense management across our organization. The latter is not easy and I want to thank the entire Intel team as we thoughtfully execute on cost reductions and efficiency improvements that support the investments critical to drive our strategy. Q1 results demonstrate the progress we are making to advance our transformation and the IDM 2.0 strategy. We still have more work to do as we reestablish process, product and cost leadership, but we continue to provide proof points each quarter and we remain committed to delivering long-term value for all our shareholders. Consistent with prior quarters, I'd like to focus my comments in three areas: one, our view of the macro and our markets; two, key highlights from Q1; and three, an update on our strategic priorities with a focus on our move to an internal foundry model. As the industry continues to navigate through multiple global challenges and headwinds, we remain cautious on the macro outlook, even as we expect some modest recovery in the second half. We are seeing increasing stability in the PC market with inventory corrections largely proceeding as we had expected. However, the server and networking markets have yet to reach their bottoms as Cloud and Enterprise remain weak. As a result, our Q2 revenue guide embeds continued inventory corrections in our core markets and a range of normal seasonal to better-than-seasonal growth off depressed Q1 revenue levels. We remain focused on what is within our control and steadfast in our commitment to advancing our strategy. As we anticipated on our Q4 earnings call, the PC market depleted a significant amount of inventory in Q1 and is tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2. Importantly, the PC installed base is larger and usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels, and along with a better-than-expected Q1, strengthens our view that the PC market is on track to a sell-through of 270 million units in calendar year '23. As we highlighted during our PC webinar in January, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units, plus or minus. In Servers, Q1 consumption TAM declined both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate and we still expect to see first-half '23 TAM decline year-on-year with a modest recovery in second half of the year. While all segments have weakened, we'd reiterate that the correction in Enterprise and Rest-of-World, where we have stronger positions, is further along and will likely recover more quickly. Lastly, in our broad-based markets like Industrial, Auto and Infrastructure, demand trends are relatively stronger. Although, as anticipated, NEX did see a Q1 inventory correction that we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters and likely will cause NEX revenue to decline this year. In contrast, PSG, IFS, and Mobileye continue on a strong growth trajectory and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year '23, much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digits decline in the semiconductor market ex-memory. While the semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature, we continue to accelerate our transformation and position ourselves to capture the significant market growth in semis expected over the next decade, nearly doubling to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Combined with the need for globally balanced and resilient supply chains and a foundry market expected to be roughly $200 billion by 2030, we are well-positioned to capitalize on multiple vectors of growth. On that front, let me highlight some key milestones from Q1. We are relentlessly focused on driving execution excellence across process and product roadmaps and throughout the company, including a rigorous focus on efficiency and cost savings. Looking first at the progress we're making with our process roadmap, we remain on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Relative to five nodes in four years, notably, two out of these five nodes, Intel 7 and Intel 4, are now essentially done. Intel 7 is in high-volume manufacturing, and Meteor Lake on Intel 4 is ramping production wafer starts today for a second-half product launch. We are quickly mastering EUV technology with Intel 4 as our first EUV node. As we focus on the next three nodes, Intel 3 is on track and we highlighted in our recent DCAI webinar, Sierra Forest will begin shipping in the first half of '24, with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both on Intel 3. We also have significant milestones planned in Q2 for Intel 3, Intel 20A and Intel 18A, and look forward to providing more details as we execute. Overall, we are squarely on track to deliver five nodes in four years. We understand that our foundry ambitions will not be realized overnight, building a vibrant foundry ecosystem will take time. But we also understand our foundry success is vitally important to establishing a geographically diverse and secure supply of semiconductors. We took a major step forward in building our ecosystem this month when we announced a multi-generation agreement with ARM Holdings. This will enable chip designers to build leading-edge mobile SoC designs on Intel 18A, giving the design community a new foundry alternative for product innovation and fast time-to-market, while also opening up new options and approaches for large ecosystem of ARM customers. We look forward to providing access to best-in-class CPU IP and the power of an open system foundry with leading-edge process technology. Finally, as part of my recent trip to China, we continue to work hard to complete the Tower acquisition and we'll update you appropriately. In our webinar last month, we provided a substantial update on our Data Center and AI business, highlighting the progress and health of our roadmap. Sapphire Rapids, our 4th Gen Xeon is one of the highest-quality data center CPUs Intel has ever delivered and continues to ramp aggressively with excellent customer feedback. We are shipping over 400 designs across numerous system and memory configurations for all OEMs, ODM, and cloud providers and we are on track to 1 million units by midyear. Notably, AI inference performance and confidential computing substantially differentiate our 4th Gen Xeon from competitors, specifically 4th Gen Xeon offers the most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio in the industry, including virtual machine isolation with Intel Trust Domain extensions or Intel TDX and trust attestation services. Just this week leading cloud service providers signaled readiness for Intel TDX instances, including Alibaba Cloud, with Microsoft announcing their preview on Azure, and Google releasing joint research conducted pre-launch to further harden TDX in complex environments. Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable is already sampling with customers and is on track to launch in Q4 '23. As stated earlier, Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will begin shipping in first half '24, with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter. Both of which are receiving very positive responses from sampled customers. Sierra Forest is our first E-core server CPU which will provide competitive performance per watt across workloads and leadership across many, with all of the benefits of the x86 ecosystem. Clearwater Forest, which is the follow on to Sierra Forest, is coming to market in 2025 and will be manufactured on Intel 18A, the node where we intend to achieve process leadership, and representing the culmination of our five-nodes-in-four-year strategy. The combination of our roadmap strengthening as we highlighted in our webinar, better-than-expected Q1 market share results, and great execution on the Xeon Gen 4 ramp, Q1 was a turning point as the first quarter of an improving Data Center position since I became CEO. Further in Q1, we taped-in the Habana Gaudi3 AI Accelerator and the Habana Gaudi2 is in the market and offering substantial performance advantage over A100 in training and inferencing, vision and language models. For example, Gaudi2 delivered 60% higher power efficiency measured in throughput per watt for inferencing large language models such as BLOOM 176-billion parameter model. Along with 4th Gen Xeon and Xeon Max, Gaudi enables us to address the accelerating growth in AI. Recent endorsements by Hugging Face and Stability AI are strong proof points of the validation in our AI roadmap and strategy. Our strategy is to truly democratize the incredible power of AI, championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from Cloud to Enterprise, Network, Edge, and Client across training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. Our OneAPI now includes the open and royalty-free C++ based programming model, SYCL, which is critical to driving collaboration and innovation. As developers want the ability to write once, run anywhere, our open-source toolkit, SYCLomatic, is helping to accelerate the migration to SYCL as we work to democratize AI. While AI development sparked by enthusiasm around generative AI is today centered on LLMs in the cloud, AI deployment will rapidly migrate to inference as the dominant AI workload, and adoption will quickly expand outwards to Edge and Client, all areas that play to our strengths. We are focused on capitalizing across all segments with optimized silicon and software solutions. Our Programmable Solutions business continues to perform well with an all-time record revenue in Q1. And our FPGA portfolio now includes more than 15 new products scheduled to PRQ this calendar year, the highest number of new product introductions ever in our FPGA business. PSG is also piloting an initiative to build a more resilient supply chain by which customers would provide Intel with enhanced demand and new design visibility, while Intel provides customers with greater predictability of supply, leveraging the benefits of transitioning a great percentage of PSG products to an Intel supply-chain. Our Client Computing business continues to execute on this roadmap and build on recent market share wins. We gained overall PC market share in Q1 and expect our competitive position to continue to improve as we ramp Meteor Lake production in Q2 for a launch in second half. In Q1, we introduced our 13th Gen Intel Core Mobile processor, followed by our new vPro platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel vPro delivers the most comprehensive security and the necessary hardware for companies in the need of a PC refresh and increased productivity. In 2023, our expansive commercial portfolio will deliver more than 170 notebooks, desktops, and entry workstations from technology providers such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Panasonic and Samsung Electronics. Turning to NEX and Mobileye, at Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated that nearly all vRAN and virtualized network core deployments run on an Intel. We also introduced a range of products and solutions that enable the world's networks, from the Core to the Radio Access Network and out to the intelligent Edge to transition from fixed-function hardware to open programmable software-defined platforms. Highlights include the launch of our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel vRAN boost, delivering 2 times the capacity gains gen over gen, within the same power envelope and up to an additional 20% power savings with integrated acceleration, and with extensive industry support from Ericsson, Verizon, Telefonica and Vodafone, among many others. In particular, Ericsson has been working closely with us to enable the cloudification of the network, making possible industry-scale Open RAN. Lastly, Mobileye continues to be an important part of the Intel family and delivered strong growth and profitability in Q1. They continue to gain significant traction with customers for their advanced product portfolio, and we remain very confident in the long-term growth profile and value of the Mobileye business. In addition to our process and product roadmap, we continue to make progress on our commitment to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. We are well on our way towards our goal of reducing $3 billion in costs in 2023, and $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings exiting 2025. We further rationalize our products as we prioritize our investments in support of IDM 2.0. This includes integrating AXG into DCAI and CCG, respectively. In addition, we exited our server business in Q1 and signed an agreement with MiTAC, an Edge to Cloud IT solutions provider and longstanding ODM partner, to manufacture and sell products based on the designs of our server systems business to create a path forward for our channel customers. I'm going to spend a few minutes on cost leadership. Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with some of you on the East Coast, and while everyone understands that we are establishing an internal foundry model, I'm not sure we've fully explained the importance and impact of this change. Giving the manufacturing group their own P&L and the BUs' standard wafer price will drive a more efficient factory network and a better decision on design to cost at the BU level. It will also serve to create parity between internal and external foundry customers and drive a more efficient manufacturing cost structure needed to compete and win external foundry customers. With a separate P&L for the manufacturing group, we will also provide you with a cleaner comparison of the BUs to their external fabless peers. As we stated on our Q3 earnings call, we believe the structure should allow us to access and execute on multiple pools of profit that are unique to an IDM, which none of our peers have. Establishing an internal foundry model is one of the most consequential steps we are taking to deliver IDM 2.0, and fundamentally shifts the way the company operates and the incentive mechanisms that drive day-to-day behaviors. We look forward to discussing this in more detail during our Internal Foundry webinar in Q2. I am proud of our team's progress this quarter. We remain committed to executing on our strategic roadmap by, first, delivering on five nodes in four years, achieving process performance parity in 2024, and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A. Second, executing on our Data Center and AI roadmap, including the Sapphire Rapids ramp; the launch of Emerald Rapids in the second half of '23, and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024. Third, ramping Meteor Lake in second half '23, and launching Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake in 2024. And fourth, expanding our IFS customer base to include large design wins on advanced packaging, Intel 16, Intel 3, and Intel 18A this year. As we improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency, we will first return to profitability. Second, execute on our Internal foundry P&L by 2024; and third, expand the use of our Smart Capital strategy to balance our long-term capital aspirations with near-term realities. We are steadfast in our commitment to continue to effectively allocate your capital in the pursuit of creating value for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to honor and pay tribute to the life of Gordon Moore, who passed away on March 24. Gordon defined and enabled the technology industry through his insight and vision. He was instrumental in revealing the power of transistors and inspired technologists and entrepreneurs across the decades. I am forever grateful for his guiding hand, willingness to mentor me, and his unwavering friendship. Gordon famously said, \"What can be done, can be outdone.\" This is our guiding principle as stewards of Moore's Law, which we intend to enable and drive until the periodic table is exhausted, as we use the power of technology to improve the lives of every person on earth. Intel will hold a memorial service to honor the life and accomplishments of Gordon and we will share more details on this shortly.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove solid business execution in the first quarter, beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. Against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic volatility, we will continue to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively manage expenses near term, and drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure long-term. First quarter revenue was $11.7 billion, $700 million above the midpoint of our guide. Results from CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye exceeded our expectations, partially offset by softer demand in the Network and Edge markets, impacting NEX revenue in the quarter. Gross margin was 38.4%, modestly below our guidance on higher-than-expected inventory reserves tied to continued macro uncertainty. Q1 margins were impacted 300 basis points by factory underload charges taken in the period. EPS was negative $0.04 for the quarter, $0.11 cents better than guide, demonstrating our cross-company focus on spending discipline. Operating cash flow in Q1 was negative $1.8 billion, net CapEx was $7 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $8.8 billion, and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $27 billion and a strong investment-grade profile. Before moving to Business Unit results, I will highlight a few changes made within our segment reporting. The Client and Data Center focused products from the former AXG business are now reported within our CCG and DCAI segments, respectively, and will have a dilutive effect on the operating margins of those businesses. Our Silicon Photonics and Foundry Automotive businesses have moved out of NEX and IFS, respectively, and are now reported as part of all other revenue, sharpening our focus on the significant market opportunities available to both NEX and IFS. Shifting to the first-quarter business unit results. CCG achieved revenue of $5.8 billion, better than our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to see a challenging demand environment, especially in our Consumer and Education segments, customers continue to prefer Intel, driven by our leadership product performance. As discussed last quarter, we saw a significant inventory burn at our customers in the period. While inventory levels remain elevated, we anticipate the market will be closer to equilibrium as we exit Q2. ASPs were down sequentially due to mix. Q1 operating profit was $520 million, flat sequentially despite revenue declining 13% from Q4, and down year-over-year on lower revenue, higher unit costs and excess capacity charges, partially offset by reduced OpEx. DCAI revenue was $3.7 billion, ahead of our expectations in Xeon, PSG and AXG lines of business. We saw a significant sequential and year-over-year TAM contraction across all CPU market segments and expect demand to remain soft in the second quarter. We saw stable CPU market share in Q1 and are excited by the broad market ramp of our 4th Generation Xeon Scalable processor: Sapphire Rapids. Operating loss was $518 million, impacted sequentially by lower revenue, higher product costs and investment in leadership products on new process nodes. DCAI margins were also diluted by the merge of the AXG business and inventory reserves tied to the exit of our Server System business. Within our DCAI business, the Programmable Solutions Group delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter in Q1, up 36% year-over-year, with increased ASPs and improved external supply, which enables us to satisfy customer backlog, helping to drive continued operating profit growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, below our expectations for the quarter, driven by demand softness and elevated inventory levels in our Network and Edge markets, consistent with the overall industry. Operating loss was $300 million, impacted sequentially by depressed revenue in the quarter and inventory reserves, partially offset by continued expense management and discipline. Mobileye continues to outperform underlying Automotive end-markets, delivering record first-quarter revenue of $458 million, up 16% year-over-year, along with a 6% year-over-year increase in content per vehicle. Profitability continues to be strong with Q1 operating income of $123 million. IFS revenue was $118 million, including 67% sequential growth in Packaging revenue. Operating loss was $140 million, impacted sequentially by increased factory startup costs as we invest in a strategic growth business. We're well on our way towards our committed $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023, on our path to $8 billion to $10 billion of reductions, exiting 2025, which will exclude benefits from the change in Equipment Useful Life. As demonstrated by our Q1 results, focused investment prioritization and spending discipline have our OpEx reductions trending ahead of expectation. While revenue-adjusted cost-of-sales reductions faced headwinds from factory underload charges and inventory reserves due to continued demand uncertainty. As Pat highlighted, our shift to an Internal Foundry model is already demonstrating a path to the structural cost improvements necessary to achieve our long-term profit goals. We've seen early wins with a reduction in disruptive factory expedites, an increased focus on sort and test times. We look forward to unpacking the financial and operational benefits of our Internal Foundry model in much more detail in our Investor webinar later in the quarter. Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect second-quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. At the midpoint of $12 billion, we expect billings to continue to trail consumption in our Data Center, Network and Client markets as customers focus on rightsizing operating inventories. While we remain cautious, we're seeing green shoots and expect sequential revenue growth throughout the year. Pat mentioned the continued strong signals of elevated PC usage and active devices, giving us confidence that our short-term headwinds are an anomaly to long-term revenue opportunity. Demand for AI capabilities in the Cloud, across the Network and at the Edge continue to grow, and we're confident that our CPU and Accelerator portfolios are well-positioned to benefit from the market tailwind. We're forecasting Q2 gross margin of 37.5%, a tax rate of 13%, an EPS of negative $0.04 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q2 gross margins by approximately 300 basis points. While gross margins are well below acceptable levels, I'd highlight inventory reserves on pre-PRQ products impact Q2 margins by approximately 250 basis points, costs, which should begin to unwind later this year as new products launch. Increased sample costs in support of our Xeon product road map will impact margins by 40 basis points sequentially. Our Q2 guidance includes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating margin from the useful life accounting change we announced in January, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to OpEx, up from $460 million in Q1. It's important to remember that this is a fixed cost business. The impact of underloaded factories goes beyond the period charges we're seeing in the first half of the year and will be felt for several quarters as we sell through products with higher average unit costs. We'll continue to deploy factory capacity prudently as we operate within our smart capital framework. As communicated last quarter, we expect to manage net CapEx intensity in the low 30% of revenue range in 2023, with capital offsets of approximately 20% to 30% of gross CapEx. Consistent with smart capital, IFS capacity represents approximately 10% of 2023 gross CapEx, a number which will scale in line with foundry customer commitments. With gross CapEx weighted to first half and capital offsets weighted to second half, we expect adjusted free cash flow to improve sequentially throughout the year and to be positive in second half of 2023. While we're encouraged by first quarter revenue and expect growth to improve sequentially through 2023, we're not satisfied with our financial results and remain focused on what we can control. Our execution and the prioritization of our owner's capital toward our long-term goals. We're confident that as we deliver on our road map commitments, we will meet and exceed our customers' expectations for our products and our owners' expectations for strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.\nTimothyArcuri: Thanks a lot. Dave, I wonder if you can go through the gross margin walk kind of through the rest of the year. There's a lot of moving parts. I know you have the underutilization of 300 basis points. And it sounds like you also have another 200 basis points you highlighted from these pre-PRQ costs. So you're sort of normalized at 43 ex those two things, but there's a couple of offsets, too. You got puts and takes around higher die costs from these new products like Meteor and Sapphire. So can you sort of give us a walk in terms of what the puts and takes are when you move past June? Thanks.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Sure, Tim. Let me give you a little color. So on the 250 basis points that you correctly highlight that are the pre-PRQ reserves, the benefit of that is as we go into the back half of the year, that's related to Meteor Lake and Emerald. And as those ship, a lot of that reverses. In fact, in essence, we end up shipping it at 100% gross margin. So that becomes a tailwind. And then we do expect, as things improve from a demand perspective, that we will start to load the fab back up. The only, I guess, cautionary comment is that we still have under-loaded costs that kind of are built into the cost of our product that are held in inventory. And so there are -- it does take a few quarters even beyond the time where we start to stop seeing these period costs of underutilization that we'll start to still see some cost headwinds from that. But ultimately, we'll be loading the fabs up to the appropriate levels, and that will be a nice tailwind. So maybe the best way to describe it is, I think, for the back half of the year, we feel like we'll be comfortably in the 40s from a gross margin perspective based on all those factors. And obviously, we're actively working on our $8 billion to $10 billion of spending reductions by the time we get to the end of 2025, and a lot of that is in the cost base, which will be a benefit to gross margins.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. Yes. Pat, I guess you have a lot of products coming out in a pretty short amount of time. Basically, you've got five data center platforms in 2.5 years. I understand that some are E-core and some are P-core, but usually, customers want to leverage their investments in these platforms for a longer time than that. So could that be some impediment to how quickly these platforms could ramp? Can you kind of talk about that?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, it's a great question, Tim. And what I'd highlight is that Sapphire and Emerald Gen 4 and Gen 5 are the same platform. So from the customer's perspective, they get to leverage those platform investments in a substantial way. Similarly, as we go into next year with Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, that's once again the same platform. And Clearwater Forest, the following year that we disclosed in the data center webinar for '25, also goes into that same platform. So essentially, even though it's five products that we've discussed, that's two platforms. And that ability to leverage that platform across a broader market space is very warmly received by our customers. And obviously, as we're working through this period to get back to solid leadership, we're getting increasing momentum from our customers. And as I highlighted, in my prepared remarks, this was a good quarter for our data center business, a very healthy road map. We did better than we forecast in Q1 market share on track for the Sapphire Rapids ramp. And overall, being able to see these new use cases for AI inferencing in the platform, being able to deploy the increasing security capabilities that we disclosed, all of these are very unique feature capabilities that are both differentiating as well as value add for our customers that helps them to see the value in the underlying platforms that we're delivering. So a very good quarter. Thanks for the question, Tim.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've talked about PC CPU inventory normalizing exiting the June quarter. Can you give us a sense by how much you were under shipping end demand today? How do you think about the snapback? And can you talk about the timing of planned raising of utilization, at least for your CCG business?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. So I'll start on that, and Dave can jump in. Generally, we think that we undersold into the market by about 20% in Q1, and that continues in Q2. And overall, we said a 270 million unit sell-through TAM for the year. That equates -- it was essentially equivalent to the 240 million or 250 million units sell-in TAM that you might have seen from some of the industry analysts. So overall, we think first half, we end the first half with a very healthy inventory position by our OEMs and by the channel. That positions us very well for natural improvement in a stronger second half as we're now selling, I'll say, in at the same rate of selling out in the marketplace in a normally stronger back half of the year. Overall, this is just going to be a positive every quarter as we go through the year. We're seeing strong momentum from our customers for our road map. And as Dave indicated, we're already starting to build inventory for the Meteor Lake launch later in the year, which is another strong indication. Dave, if you want to comment on the inventory comment?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So we have about 155 days of inventory aggregate - in the aggregate on the balance sheet. Obviously, as we get through the inventory depletion at customers and we start to normalize back up to the level of end consumption, we'll start to burn through that inventory, and you can expect us to start ramping the factories. I don't think we'll be fully ramped by the end of the year, but we certainly will be improving the ramp through the year.\nJohn Pitzer: C.J., do you have a follow-up question?\nC.J. Muse: Yes, a quick one. Pat, in your prepared remarks, you talked about positive feedback from tests at your customers for Sierra and Granite. Curious if you can share any of the feedback that you're hearing to give us confidence on that ramp?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I'd say, generally, the feedback is, wow, right? You guys are delivering at the front end of your scheduled windows that you gave us with a very high-quality product, and they're now into their, what we call, the volume validation phase of their platforms. So where they're receiving enough samples that they can start to do broad validation of the platform. That validation cycle is very critical for us because it informs us of when we're ready to move forward with the production stepping of those parts in both the software and the firmware of the platform. We're seeing very good response on both the first E-core part with Sierra Forest as well as the next-generation P-core part with Granite Rapids. So overall, I'd just say we feel super good that we're getting such a warm response from customers. And this positions us very well as they're rebuilding their confidence in Intel. And this -- you've heard me talk before, C.J., that we have to rebuild our customers' confidence and the performance that we're seeing, not just on Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids Gen 5, but next year's products and the very strong position for the E-core products going into 2025 with Clearwater Forest has been a strong uptick in their belief that Intel's execution machine is back for their data center products of the future.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Pat, in your preamble, you talked a little bit about some data center trends by the end markets, a little bit geographically, a little bit customer type with enterprise. I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper into what you're seeing in the cloud side of things. The customers themselves seem to be reporting very strong numbers, but it seems that you alluded to that still being an inventory digesting end market for you. And then how Intel, specifically in cloud, is doing competitively?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And clearly, there was a down quarter for enterprise and for cloud. We do see that affecting the first -- at least the first half of the year. That said, we're encouraged by some of the comments that you've heard and that you refer to for the overall market. We do see that our position is improving. As I indicated in Q1, we saw a better-than-forecast market segment share. We also saw some green shoots for the first time in China. And we're encouraged by that market starting to show some positive characteristics. We'd also say that some of that strength in data center is driven by AI. And we're seeing a very positive response to Gaudi 2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line. We also saw that as a driver of the early strong ramp for Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids. Those taken together, we are -- we do believe that's an important trend. But we also, as you said, in my prepared remarks, we see that we need to make AI and that is a critical use case broadly available. And that's what we refer to as democratizing AI, where those super high-end machines are uneconomical for most environments, and we have to enable the broad deployment of inferencing, being able to use AI. And that's an area where, particularly our core Xeon product line, has particular strengths well above prior generations and competitive alternatives and one that we expect to be an area of strength for us long-term.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a follow-up?\nRoss Seymore: I do. I just wanted to go back and revisit the gross margin side so one for Dave. The underutilization charges, is there some trigger point at which, revenue-wise, I guess, we should expect that to go away because, obviously, that's the 300 basis point headwind, two quarters in a row of that? And then the pre-PRQ side of things, given the frequency of new product introductions that was alluded to in a prior question, it doesn't seem like those would necessarily go away that fast, or if they do for a quarter or two, they would come back. So can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on those underutilization charges and pre-PRQ please?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, okay. So on the pre-PRQ, you're right, and it always is lumpy. We saw this effect midway through last year with Sapphire Rapids. And so, we will have these on occasion. But we think for the second half of the year, for sure, we won't see this magnitude of pre-PRQ reserves is a pretty significant quarter for us in the second quarter. On the under-loading charges, I think it's -- partially, it's about revenue, but partially it's about our inventory levels and where they are. So we obviously need to bring the inventory levels down from the 155 days. That's going to be important. I think I would just say that, hey, in the third and fourth quarter, I would see - I would expect to see an improving situation in terms of underloads. And likely, that will be behind us by the time we're through the end of the year, just on the period cost under load charges. We might be living with some higher cost per unit for a couple of quarters after that, because of under-load that we built into the cost of the products. But ultimately, we'll have this factory, the factory network loaded back up.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Ross. Jonathan, can we have next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey from Cowen. Your question please.\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon guys. Pat, I wanted to - the first question I wanted to ask is on sort of the node roadmap. You guys have made some good progress there, and we're working through some end market and near-term product dynamics, but focusing on the five nodes in four years. I know there's, some internal nodes that are being developed as well around backside power via and also gate all around? So maybe you could give a little bit of an update as to how those roadmaps are going on those two pieces of technology individually? And I guess the second part of the question, if you do succeed in getting to node parity and the node leadership as you described, can you talk about a path to cost parity for internal and external potential customers on 18A? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Yes, great question, Matt. And as I indicated, the five nodes in four years, Intel 7 done, Intel 4 with the Meteor Lake of volume ramp, we view that as all but done, right? We are -- essentially, the process is PRQ-ed. And now we're ramping the product, which will PRQ later in the year. So we feel like we're two of five are now completed. Obviously, the next one up is Intel 3. And with Intel 3, the positive updates that we've given on Granite and Sierra Forest for next year, the volume sampling that I've already referred to gives us a lot of confidence that, that is now coming along very nicely. Both Intel 4 and Intel 3 are EUV nodes. As you say, as we go to 20A and 18A, the two major innovations are the RibbonFET, the gate all around transistor architecture and the backside power. Given the uniqueness of the backside power, as you indicated, we had an internal node that we didn't expose to products or externally to derisk that node, and that went extremely well. We had very good results from the backside power, the power delivery, the routability improvements that gave. And as I was -- as one proof point of that -- the Arm announcement was one that demonstrated significant benefits of backside power that we were able to do. So 20A and 18A are the next ones up. 20A will be primarily a client node as we ramp our Arrow Lake products in '24 and '25. 18A will be everything. We will have server products, client products, networking products and many foundry products. We also noted that this was the quarter that we have our first foundry test chips coming out. And so some of the test chips for external customers on 18A are now popping out a fab and being tested by them. So good affirmation from them, you also mentioned, I think it's actually a very insightful question, Matt, the cost structure. And one of the things that we've put a lot of emphasis on with 18A is getting to structural cost parity with what we believe is the best in the industry at that point. So, we view this as not just getting to power and performance parity, but also area parity and cost structural parity as we get to 18A. And we believe, as we've benchmarked ourselves against the industry best, we believe we're on track to do that in the 18A timeframe. And that's part of why we talk about in the internal foundry model as being able to start really measuring the P&L right? I'm really viewing it as the industry price for wafers is understood, and we have to benchmark ourselves against that and deliver margin structure at the wafer level that's competitive with that.\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-up?\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes I do John and thank you Pat for the detail there. My second question is on server roadmap, and you guys had a helpful DCAI roadmap day a month or so ago. I guess my question is kind of related to another question that was asked on platforms compatibility. I think Pat, you mentioned a few products on the roadmap, including - up into including Clearwater Forest being on the same sort of platform as Granite? There was another product that was on the public roadmap before, Diamond Rapids, for the next sort of P-core product. Any update there? I just want to - it wasn't really mentioned in the DCAI Day, and I've had a few folks asking me about it. And is it on the same platform? Thanks.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And while we're not speaking a lot about that next-generation product, that would be the introduction of the next-generation platform at that point would be when we move to the next platform, which will change package architecture, power delivery architecture, memory channel, key steps in memory scalability with our CXL technology. So that will be a big step in terms of the platform architecture at that point. And I'll just say, every aspect of our roadmap is getting well received by our customers for both enterprise, but also and critically for cloud customers as well.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Matt. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your question please.\nPierre Ferragu: Sorry. Is the line is that for me clear?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, Pierre, how are you?\nPierre Ferragu: Yes, sorry apologies, it's very unlucky the line gets right when you say my name. Thanks for all the details on the gross margin. And taking a step back, I'm kind of thinking between now and the end of 2025, your gross margin is going to be very volatile and very difficult to read because you have a lot on your plate, a lot of costs coming in and out with all the various nodes? And so my question would be, maybe looking at things from a much higher level, let's say, we are around about 20 points below the historic margins as Intel being in a good competitive position. Some of that is clearly a scale issue. The business has shrunk a lot recently. And then some of that is really this very difficult 10-nanometer node where the cost per unit is significantly too high? And so my question really is, from what you know already from the nodes that you have coming up like that is now very, very tangible across Intel 4, how much of this gap are you going to regain with this node, really looking at it on the wafer against wafer, without making that any sort of guide of what do you get in 2023 or '24 or '25? But forgetting about the roadmap, looking at it, wafer against wafer, what order of magnitude of improvement in pricing power do you think you get or earnings power just because you now have like a competitive cost base in your manufacturing?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So I'll take some of it, and then you...\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, yes.\nDavid Zinsner: Maybe like at a high level, Pierre, maybe the way to think about it is, look, one element of getting to the appropriate cost structure to deliver the margins is getting our process technology to be competitive. And that's really at 18A where we intersect that. So we make improvements along the way, but that's really where we make the meaningful improvement to get there from a process perspective. Now the challenge is all along the way, there's this kind of start-up costs that we have to deal with, which is hundreds of basis points of headwind for us that we have, by virtue of the fact that we're stacked on stacked. The five nodes in four years that Pat is driving is the right strategy, but it does create headwinds on the cost side. So that - we've got to work our way through that, but once we're on the other side of five nodes in four years, we have a competitive process technology from a cost perspective. We've gotten ourselves this, let's say, significantly higher startup costs that we are incurring behind us as well. And then as you point out, you have the benefits of the scale of revenue that we would expect. And then lastly, you have, as Pat was talking about, this whole notion of the internal foundry model, which just drives a lot of attention on cost and where we think we're going to get a lot of that $8 billion to $10 billion of savings exiting 2025. So I think, the way I look at it at least is that we put forth a model for gross margins. We changed the depreciation, which incrementally raises that target. And there's nothing that's going on at the company that would suggest that we're off pace from that. We think we are going to achieve that. The timing is obviously a function somewhat of the market. But other than that, we feel like we're on a great path to have those margins.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I would just say there will be lumpiness Pierre, right, of the ups and downs along the way, when process nodes come online, as you work through different product cycles, et cetera. But we'd say, as Dave said, we're going from the 30s into the 40s comfortably this year. We set a long-term model into the 50s that, if you consider the useful life, gets us up around 60 by the end of the five-year period, as we've talked about. So we're on track to, I'll say, margins should be up and to the right as we work over time with lumpiness up and down due to these various considerations, but that's the path that we're laying ourselves upon.\nJohn Pitzer: Pierre, do you have a quick follow-up question?\nPierre Ferragu: Yes, very quick one. Pat, you mentioned Gaudi like a very, very positive benchmark on large language models. When I look around me, I don't see, like, good tangible signs of Gaudi, like really gaining traction and getting big, despite the fact that the work today is really starting for more processing power and more capacity to run these models? So my question was, am I just not seeing something that will become apparent very, very soon? Or are there still building blocks and parts and things that Gaudi is missing before really taking this very fast-growing opportunity?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. I think it's a fair commentary that we're only starting to see good positive proof points in the industry. So I think that's a fair critique, Pierre. But I'd point back to the announcement of the Hugging Face, which is the most popular sort of like the GitHub of the AI world. Very positive proof point this quarter, stable diffusion, right, another in Stability AI, important forces also my comments around a rapidly growing pipeline. Obviously, you can't measure that, but I'll tell you, we have many opportunities that we're now engaging in globally. You'll also see us taking more aggressive steps with our dev cloud presenting this as a developer environment for the market. So I think we have a lot of work to do here to show up in a meaningful way. But we think the Gaudi 2 strategy has now started to gain quite a lot of interest in the market. As I said in my prepared remarks, Gaudi 3 has now taped out, which will be the next step-up. Also, we're describing the customers our 2025 platform, the Falcon Shores product, which is another step-up. That also brings together the full offering of our HPC and AI into a single platform offering. Customers are responding very well to the, I'll say, the alignment and simplification of our roadmap in HPC and AI coming together. So overall, we feel like we're now starting to show up in this space, but we have a lot of work to do to land meaningful revenue customers in this area. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to put some clear proof points that you can start to see in the marketplace in the near future.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Pierre. Jonathan, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. I had a near-term and then a longer-term one. So on the near term, how should we think about the second half? Right now, when I look at consensus expectations. They are set for about 15% to 20% half-on-half growth. I appreciate you're not giving guidance. But is that the kind of growth that is contemplated or reflected in the return to the low 40s gross margin?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I think what Pat said is, we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year. And that, combined with the fact that pre-PRQ reserves reverse themselves, we'll probably see some better utilization levels. That's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s, and we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half?\nPat Gelsinger: Well, I'd say there's three things to just think about for the second half. One is that you normally have a stronger second half in our industry. We expect that to be the case. Second is we'll have worked through a lot of the inventory issues as you go first half to second half. And we are seeing some green shoots in the marketplace. We think it's a tough market for all, right? And we're navigating through it well, as seen by our top and bottom line beat in Q1. But hey, it's a tough market out there. So we're still being fairly cautious as we look out over time. And then third, obviously, our strengthening execution. Our road map is getting stronger. We're gaining market share. And I think of our Q1 as a solid proof point that we're navigating through the tough environment that we have in a better way than most. So we are incrementally more positive on the second half, but we also believe we have to continue careful execution, careful fiscal discipline as we go through a very uncertain macro outlook.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up?\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. So Pat, my longer-term question is, how do you see the role of Arm in the server CPU market? It's interesting that you're starting to partner with Ampere on Arm servers. I presume that implies a more credible ecosystem developing for Arm servers. I believe it's already around mid-single digit or so as part of cloud instances. So how do you see the role of Arm servers over the next few years? And do you see it as -- and just what is the impact on x86 server CPU TAM, if Arm becomes bigger in the market?\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And a couple of things here, Vivek. One is the announcement that we did with Arm this quarter around IFS, it was a strong ecosystem statement for our foundry offerings and one that was focused around the mobile platform, but we do expect that we'll have a broader play over time as the announcement indicated that it's first focused on mobile, where Arm has proven considerable strength across the market. I'd also say that we think of the market and the future of four architectures matter. Arm, RISC-V, x86, right, you're playing a critical role and the role of accelerators in GPU, right? And we'll be participating across all of those, whether that's through foundry or through our product offerings. I've continued to view that if we are doing a great job with our road map that the role of Arm in the data center will be limited, right? And particularly with the E-core product line that we've laid now laid out with Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest and strong products coming thereafter, we believe that we now deliver power performance TCO benefit at x86. Migrating software stacks in the data center is a lot of work, right? And if I give customers an easy path with x86 and E-core solutions with superior TCO alternatives, that will do very well. So with that, that's our primary play. At the same time, our foundry play will become one, come all. We will manufacture, right, any of the RISC-V arm, x86 and GPU alternatives for the industry through our superior capabilities in our foundry offerings over time. We view this as an industry play of great significance and one that we're committed to competing for leadership wafers across every architecture, every segment of the industry.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks Vivek. Jonathan, we have time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the CapEx? You mentioned 10% going to foundry. Can you talk about -- I still get kind of a gross CapEx number that's north of $20 million. Does that seem like it's in the ballpark? And are you spending that money more on shelves and capacity? Or how much of that money gets allocated to the five nodes in four years?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Gross would be north of $20 million. We think, as I mentioned, that we can keep net CapEx intensity in kind of the low 30s as a percent of revenue, which is kind of within our model actually a little bit better than what we modeled during the capital-intensive phase of our transformation. As it relates to kind of the split, we are probably -- certainly, there's a lot of CapEx going to equipment. There's a lot of CapEx going to shells. We're probably a little bit more biased towards shell investment right now. We had been in the past behind, and that caught us. And these are obviously the very long lead time type investments. And so you want to be -- make sure you have a shell when you need it. And so we have biased ourselves to do that and to make the investments that are appropriate in that regard. And as you point out, as I said, it's largely around our own needs. We are making some modest investments on the foundry side right now as we start to get -- gain traction on the customer front. And as we get more customers, we'll ramp that investment as appropriate.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-up?\nJoseph Moore: I do, yes. In terms of -- in terms of the sort of capital offsets that you've got another 20% to 30%, is there the opportunity for that number to be better? For example, with the CHIPS Act, as the grant money starts to get dispersed? Or you've talked about additional yield with deals like Brookfield? Like I guess are you contemplating within that number potential future improvement? Or does that number get better if we start to see benefit from those things?\nDavid Zinsner: I mean, this is our current outlook is somewhere in the 20% to 30%. It obviously can get better. It assumes that we will have another skip by the end of the year and some government incentives. But obviously, I've got the CEO out there managing the offsets. And so I think there's certainly opportunity to see upside, if not this year, next year. And keep in mind, next year, we'll also have the benefit of the investment tax credit coming in at that point, which will obviously be helpful.\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I would just add on top of that, this is something we're working. We're engaging right now with the Department of Commerce and working through our grant applications in that area. We have modeled a certain level in the guidelines that Dave said. Obviously, we're going to be working to do better than that in this regard. And fundamentally, the CHIPS Act is all about making U.S. manufacturing competitive in the world. And that's the focus that we have and the intent of Congress as was laid out, and we hope to get those done as quickly as possible. We also had a major milestone with the EU CHIPS Act passing Parliament last week, and we continue to work on that front. And obviously, skip an investment tax credit. We're working to make our capital intensity and efficiency to be a great opportunity for us to bring shareholder returns in a meaningful way.\nPat Gelsinger: So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, let me say thank you. We're grateful that you joined us. We're grateful that we have the opportunity to give you an update on our business and the progress that we're making. While the macro is challenging and plenty of headwinds out there, we also believe that our execution on our financials will be on top of bottom line, great execution on our process and product road maps. And here we are two years into my tenure, and the journey to date has had some unexpected bumps in the road. We're also beginning to see clear points that increase my confidence that we have the right strategy, the right team, and we are executing on this transformation. And we look forward to updating you throughout the quarter and our next call together. So thank you all so much.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pat Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid first-quarter results on both the top- and bottom-line. Upside was driven by better-than-expected revenue and very disciplined expense management across our organization. The latter is not easy and I want to thank the entire Intel team as we thoughtfully execute on cost reductions and efficiency improvements that support the investments critical to drive our strategy. Q1 results demonstrate the progress we are making to advance our transformation and the IDM 2.0 strategy. We still have more work to do as we reestablish process, product and cost leadership, but we continue to provide proof points each quarter and we remain committed to delivering long-term value for all our shareholders. Consistent with prior quarters, I'd like to focus my comments in three areas: one, our view of the macro and our markets; two, key highlights from Q1; and three, an update on our strategic priorities with a focus on our move to an internal foundry model. As the industry continues to navigate through multiple global challenges and headwinds, we remain cautious on the macro outlook, even as we expect some modest recovery in the second half. We are seeing increasing stability in the PC market with inventory corrections largely proceeding as we had expected. However, the server and networking markets have yet to reach their bottoms as Cloud and Enterprise remain weak. As a result, our Q2 revenue guide embeds continued inventory corrections in our core markets and a range of normal seasonal to better-than-seasonal growth off depressed Q1 revenue levels. We remain focused on what is within our control and steadfast in our commitment to advancing our strategy. As we anticipated on our Q4 earnings call, the PC market depleted a significant amount of inventory in Q1 and is tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2. Importantly, the PC installed base is larger and usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels, and along with a better-than-expected Q1, strengthens our view that the PC market is on track to a sell-through of 270 million units in calendar year '23. As we highlighted during our PC webinar in January, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units, plus or minus. In Servers, Q1 consumption TAM declined both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate and we still expect to see first-half '23 TAM decline year-on-year with a modest recovery in second half of the year. While all segments have weakened, we'd reiterate that the correction in Enterprise and Rest-of-World, where we have stronger positions, is further along and will likely recover more quickly. Lastly, in our broad-based markets like Industrial, Auto and Infrastructure, demand trends are relatively stronger. Although, as anticipated, NEX did see a Q1 inventory correction that we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters and likely will cause NEX revenue to decline this year. In contrast, PSG, IFS, and Mobileye continue on a strong growth trajectory and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year '23, much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digits decline in the semiconductor market ex-memory. While the semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature, we continue to accelerate our transformation and position ourselves to capture the significant market growth in semis expected over the next decade, nearly doubling to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Combined with the need for globally balanced and resilient supply chains and a foundry market expected to be roughly $200 billion by 2030, we are well-positioned to capitalize on multiple vectors of growth. On that front, let me highlight some key milestones from Q1. We are relentlessly focused on driving execution excellence across process and product roadmaps and throughout the company, including a rigorous focus on efficiency and cost savings. Looking first at the progress we're making with our process roadmap, we remain on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Relative to five nodes in four years, notably, two out of these five nodes, Intel 7 and Intel 4, are now essentially done. Intel 7 is in high-volume manufacturing, and Meteor Lake on Intel 4 is ramping production wafer starts today for a second-half product launch. We are quickly mastering EUV technology with Intel 4 as our first EUV node. As we focus on the next three nodes, Intel 3 is on track and we highlighted in our recent DCAI webinar, Sierra Forest will begin shipping in the first half of '24, with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both on Intel 3. We also have significant milestones planned in Q2 for Intel 3, Intel 20A and Intel 18A, and look forward to providing more details as we execute. Overall, we are squarely on track to deliver five nodes in four years. We understand that our foundry ambitions will not be realized overnight, building a vibrant foundry ecosystem will take time. But we also understand our foundry success is vitally important to establishing a geographically diverse and secure supply of semiconductors. We took a major step forward in building our ecosystem this month when we announced a multi-generation agreement with ARM Holdings. This will enable chip designers to build leading-edge mobile SoC designs on Intel 18A, giving the design community a new foundry alternative for product innovation and fast time-to-market, while also opening up new options and approaches for large ecosystem of ARM customers. We look forward to providing access to best-in-class CPU IP and the power of an open system foundry with leading-edge process technology. Finally, as part of my recent trip to China, we continue to work hard to complete the Tower acquisition and we'll update you appropriately. In our webinar last month, we provided a substantial update on our Data Center and AI business, highlighting the progress and health of our roadmap. Sapphire Rapids, our 4th Gen Xeon is one of the highest-quality data center CPUs Intel has ever delivered and continues to ramp aggressively with excellent customer feedback. We are shipping over 400 designs across numerous system and memory configurations for all OEMs, ODM, and cloud providers and we are on track to 1 million units by midyear. Notably, AI inference performance and confidential computing substantially differentiate our 4th Gen Xeon from competitors, specifically 4th Gen Xeon offers the most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio in the industry, including virtual machine isolation with Intel Trust Domain extensions or Intel TDX and trust attestation services. Just this week leading cloud service providers signaled readiness for Intel TDX instances, including Alibaba Cloud, with Microsoft announcing their preview on Azure, and Google releasing joint research conducted pre-launch to further harden TDX in complex environments. Emerald Rapids, our 5th Gen Xeon Scalable is already sampling with customers and is on track to launch in Q4 '23. As stated earlier, Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will begin shipping in first half '24, with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter. Both of which are receiving very positive responses from sampled customers. Sierra Forest is our first E-core server CPU which will provide competitive performance per watt across workloads and leadership across many, with all of the benefits of the x86 ecosystem. Clearwater Forest, which is the follow on to Sierra Forest, is coming to market in 2025 and will be manufactured on Intel 18A, the node where we intend to achieve process leadership, and representing the culmination of our five-nodes-in-four-year strategy. The combination of our roadmap strengthening as we highlighted in our webinar, better-than-expected Q1 market share results, and great execution on the Xeon Gen 4 ramp, Q1 was a turning point as the first quarter of an improving Data Center position since I became CEO. Further in Q1, we taped-in the Habana Gaudi3 AI Accelerator and the Habana Gaudi2 is in the market and offering substantial performance advantage over A100 in training and inferencing, vision and language models. For example, Gaudi2 delivered 60% higher power efficiency measured in throughput per watt for inferencing large language models such as BLOOM 176-billion parameter model. Along with 4th Gen Xeon and Xeon Max, Gaudi enables us to address the accelerating growth in AI. Recent endorsements by Hugging Face and Stability AI are strong proof points of the validation in our AI roadmap and strategy. Our strategy is to truly democratize the incredible power of AI, championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from Cloud to Enterprise, Network, Edge, and Client across training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. Our OneAPI now includes the open and royalty-free C++ based programming model, SYCL, which is critical to driving collaboration and innovation. As developers want the ability to write once, run anywhere, our open-source toolkit, SYCLomatic, is helping to accelerate the migration to SYCL as we work to democratize AI. While AI development sparked by enthusiasm around generative AI is today centered on LLMs in the cloud, AI deployment will rapidly migrate to inference as the dominant AI workload, and adoption will quickly expand outwards to Edge and Client, all areas that play to our strengths. We are focused on capitalizing across all segments with optimized silicon and software solutions. Our Programmable Solutions business continues to perform well with an all-time record revenue in Q1. And our FPGA portfolio now includes more than 15 new products scheduled to PRQ this calendar year, the highest number of new product introductions ever in our FPGA business. PSG is also piloting an initiative to build a more resilient supply chain by which customers would provide Intel with enhanced demand and new design visibility, while Intel provides customers with greater predictability of supply, leveraging the benefits of transitioning a great percentage of PSG products to an Intel supply-chain. Our Client Computing business continues to execute on this roadmap and build on recent market share wins. We gained overall PC market share in Q1 and expect our competitive position to continue to improve as we ramp Meteor Lake production in Q2 for a launch in second half. In Q1, we introduced our 13th Gen Intel Core Mobile processor, followed by our new vPro platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors. Intel vPro delivers the most comprehensive security and the necessary hardware for companies in the need of a PC refresh and increased productivity. In 2023, our expansive commercial portfolio will deliver more than 170 notebooks, desktops, and entry workstations from technology providers such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Panasonic and Samsung Electronics. Turning to NEX and Mobileye, at Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated that nearly all vRAN and virtualized network core deployments run on an Intel. We also introduced a range of products and solutions that enable the world's networks, from the Core to the Radio Access Network and out to the intelligent Edge to transition from fixed-function hardware to open programmable software-defined platforms. Highlights include the launch of our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel vRAN boost, delivering 2 times the capacity gains gen over gen, within the same power envelope and up to an additional 20% power savings with integrated acceleration, and with extensive industry support from Ericsson, Verizon, Telefonica and Vodafone, among many others. In particular, Ericsson has been working closely with us to enable the cloudification of the network, making possible industry-scale Open RAN. Lastly, Mobileye continues to be an important part of the Intel family and delivered strong growth and profitability in Q1. They continue to gain significant traction with customers for their advanced product portfolio, and we remain very confident in the long-term growth profile and value of the Mobileye business. In addition to our process and product roadmap, we continue to make progress on our commitment to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. We are well on our way towards our goal of reducing $3 billion in costs in 2023, and $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings exiting 2025. We further rationalize our products as we prioritize our investments in support of IDM 2.0. This includes integrating AXG into DCAI and CCG, respectively. In addition, we exited our server business in Q1 and signed an agreement with MiTAC, an Edge to Cloud IT solutions provider and longstanding ODM partner, to manufacture and sell products based on the designs of our server systems business to create a path forward for our channel customers. I'm going to spend a few minutes on cost leadership. Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with some of you on the East Coast, and while everyone understands that we are establishing an internal foundry model, I'm not sure we've fully explained the importance and impact of this change. Giving the manufacturing group their own P&L and the BUs' standard wafer price will drive a more efficient factory network and a better decision on design to cost at the BU level. It will also serve to create parity between internal and external foundry customers and drive a more efficient manufacturing cost structure needed to compete and win external foundry customers. With a separate P&L for the manufacturing group, we will also provide you with a cleaner comparison of the BUs to their external fabless peers. As we stated on our Q3 earnings call, we believe the structure should allow us to access and execute on multiple pools of profit that are unique to an IDM, which none of our peers have. Establishing an internal foundry model is one of the most consequential steps we are taking to deliver IDM 2.0, and fundamentally shifts the way the company operates and the incentive mechanisms that drive day-to-day behaviors. We look forward to discussing this in more detail during our Internal Foundry webinar in Q2. I am proud of our team's progress this quarter. We remain committed to executing on our strategic roadmap by, first, delivering on five nodes in four years, achieving process performance parity in 2024, and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A. Second, executing on our Data Center and AI roadmap, including the Sapphire Rapids ramp; the launch of Emerald Rapids in the second half of '23, and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024. Third, ramping Meteor Lake in second half '23, and launching Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake in 2024. And fourth, expanding our IFS customer base to include large design wins on advanced packaging, Intel 16, Intel 3, and Intel 18A this year. As we improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency, we will first return to profitability. Second, execute on our Internal foundry P&L by 2024; and third, expand the use of our Smart Capital strategy to balance our long-term capital aspirations with near-term realities. We are steadfast in our commitment to continue to effectively allocate your capital in the pursuit of creating value for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to honor and pay tribute to the life of Gordon Moore, who passed away on March 24. Gordon defined and enabled the technology industry through his insight and vision. He was instrumental in revealing the power of transistors and inspired technologists and entrepreneurs across the decades. I am forever grateful for his guiding hand, willingness to mentor me, and his unwavering friendship. Gordon famously said, \"What can be done, can be outdone.\" This is our guiding principle as stewards of Moore's Law, which we intend to enable and drive until the periodic table is exhausted, as we use the power of technology to improve the lives of every person on earth. Intel will hold a memorial service to honor the life and accomplishments of Gordon and we will share more details on this shortly. Yes, it's a great question, Tim. And what I'd highlight is that Sapphire and Emerald Gen 4 and Gen 5 are the same platform. So from the customer's perspective, they get to leverage those platform investments in a substantial way. Similarly, as we go into next year with Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, that's once again the same platform. And Clearwater Forest, the following year that we disclosed in the data center webinar for '25, also goes into that same platform. So essentially, even though it's five products that we've discussed, that's two platforms. And that ability to leverage that platform across a broader market space is very warmly received by our customers. And obviously, as we're working through this period to get back to solid leadership, we're getting increasing momentum from our customers. And as I highlighted, in my prepared remarks, this was a good quarter for our data center business, a very healthy road map. We did better than we forecast in Q1 market share on track for the Sapphire Rapids ramp. And overall, being able to see these new use cases for AI inferencing in the platform, being able to deploy the increasing security capabilities that we disclosed, all of these are very unique feature capabilities that are both differentiating as well as value add for our customers that helps them to see the value in the underlying platforms that we're delivering. So a very good quarter. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yes. So I'll start on that, and Dave can jump in. Generally, we think that we undersold into the market by about 20% in Q1, and that continues in Q2. And overall, we said a 270 million unit sell-through TAM for the year. That equates -- it was essentially equivalent to the 240 million or 250 million units sell-in TAM that you might have seen from some of the industry analysts. So overall, we think first half, we end the first half with a very healthy inventory position by our OEMs and by the channel. That positions us very well for natural improvement in a stronger second half as we're now selling, I'll say, in at the same rate of selling out in the marketplace in a normally stronger back half of the year. Overall, this is just going to be a positive every quarter as we go through the year. We're seeing strong momentum from our customers for our road map. And as Dave indicated, we're already starting to build inventory for the Meteor Lake launch later in the year, which is another strong indication. Dave, if you want to comment on the inventory comment? Yes. And I'd say, generally, the feedback is, wow, right? You guys are delivering at the front end of your scheduled windows that you gave us with a very high-quality product, and they're now into their, what we call, the volume validation phase of their platforms. So where they're receiving enough samples that they can start to do broad validation of the platform. That validation cycle is very critical for us because it informs us of when we're ready to move forward with the production stepping of those parts in both the software and the firmware of the platform. We're seeing very good response on both the first E-core part with Sierra Forest as well as the next-generation P-core part with Granite Rapids. So overall, I'd just say we feel super good that we're getting such a warm response from customers. And this positions us very well as they're rebuilding their confidence in Intel. And this -- you've heard me talk before, C.J., that we have to rebuild our customers' confidence and the performance that we're seeing, not just on Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids Gen 5, but next year's products and the very strong position for the E-core products going into 2025 with Clearwater Forest has been a strong uptick in their belief that Intel's execution machine is back for their data center products of the future. Yes. Thank you. And clearly, there was a down quarter for enterprise and for cloud. We do see that affecting the first -- at least the first half of the year. That said, we're encouraged by some of the comments that you've heard and that you refer to for the overall market. We do see that our position is improving. As I indicated in Q1, we saw a better-than-forecast market segment share. We also saw some green shoots for the first time in China. And we're encouraged by that market starting to show some positive characteristics. We'd also say that some of that strength in data center is driven by AI. And we're seeing a very positive response to Gaudi 2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line. We also saw that as a driver of the early strong ramp for Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids. Those taken together, we are -- we do believe that's an important trend. But we also, as you said, in my prepared remarks, we see that we need to make AI and that is a critical use case broadly available. And that's what we refer to as democratizing AI, where those super high-end machines are uneconomical for most environments, and we have to enable the broad deployment of inferencing, being able to use AI. And that's an area where, particularly our core Xeon product line, has particular strengths well above prior generations and competitive alternatives and one that we expect to be an area of strength for us long-term. Yes. Yes, great question, Matt. And as I indicated, the five nodes in four years, Intel 7 done, Intel 4 with the Meteor Lake of volume ramp, we view that as all but done, right? We are -- essentially, the process is PRQ-ed. And now we're ramping the product, which will PRQ later in the year. So we feel like we're two of five are now completed. Obviously, the next one up is Intel 3. And with Intel 3, the positive updates that we've given on Granite and Sierra Forest for next year, the volume sampling that I've already referred to gives us a lot of confidence that, that is now coming along very nicely. Both Intel 4 and Intel 3 are EUV nodes. As you say, as we go to 20A and 18A, the two major innovations are the RibbonFET, the gate all around transistor architecture and the backside power. Given the uniqueness of the backside power, as you indicated, we had an internal node that we didn't expose to products or externally to derisk that node, and that went extremely well. We had very good results from the backside power, the power delivery, the routability improvements that gave. And as I was -- as one proof point of that -- the Arm announcement was one that demonstrated significant benefits of backside power that we were able to do. So 20A and 18A are the next ones up. 20A will be primarily a client node as we ramp our Arrow Lake products in '24 and '25. 18A will be everything. We will have server products, client products, networking products and many foundry products. We also noted that this was the quarter that we have our first foundry test chips coming out. And so some of the test chips for external customers on 18A are now popping out a fab and being tested by them. So good affirmation from them, you also mentioned, I think it's actually a very insightful question, Matt, the cost structure. And one of the things that we've put a lot of emphasis on with 18A is getting to structural cost parity with what we believe is the best in the industry at that point. So, we view this as not just getting to power and performance parity, but also area parity and cost structural parity as we get to 18A. And we believe, as we've benchmarked ourselves against the industry best, we believe we're on track to do that in the 18A timeframe. And that's part of why we talk about in the internal foundry model as being able to start really measuring the P&L right? I'm really viewing it as the industry price for wafers is understood, and we have to benchmark ourselves against that and deliver margin structure at the wafer level that's competitive with that. Yes. And while we're not speaking a lot about that next-generation product, that would be the introduction of the next-generation platform at that point would be when we move to the next platform, which will change package architecture, power delivery architecture, memory channel, key steps in memory scalability with our CXL technology. So that will be a big step in terms of the platform architecture at that point. And I'll just say, every aspect of our roadmap is getting well received by our customers for both enterprise, but also and critically for cloud customers as well. Yes, yes. Yes. And I would just say there will be lumpiness Pierre, right, of the ups and downs along the way, when process nodes come online, as you work through different product cycles, et cetera. But we'd say, as Dave said, we're going from the 30s into the 40s comfortably this year. We set a long-term model into the 50s that, if you consider the useful life, gets us up around 60 by the end of the five-year period, as we've talked about. So we're on track to, I'll say, margins should be up and to the right as we work over time with lumpiness up and down due to these various considerations, but that's the path that we're laying ourselves upon. Yes. I think it's a fair commentary that we're only starting to see good positive proof points in the industry. So I think that's a fair critique, Pierre. But I'd point back to the announcement of the Hugging Face, which is the most popular sort of like the GitHub of the AI world. Very positive proof point this quarter, stable diffusion, right, another in Stability AI, important forces also my comments around a rapidly growing pipeline. Obviously, you can't measure that, but I'll tell you, we have many opportunities that we're now engaging in globally. You'll also see us taking more aggressive steps with our dev cloud presenting this as a developer environment for the market. So I think we have a lot of work to do here to show up in a meaningful way. But we think the Gaudi 2 strategy has now started to gain quite a lot of interest in the market. As I said in my prepared remarks, Gaudi 3 has now taped out, which will be the next step-up. Also, we're describing the customers our 2025 platform, the Falcon Shores product, which is another step-up. That also brings together the full offering of our HPC and AI into a single platform offering. Customers are responding very well to the, I'll say, the alignment and simplification of our roadmap in HPC and AI coming together. So overall, we feel like we're now starting to show up in this space, but we have a lot of work to do to land meaningful revenue customers in this area. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to put some clear proof points that you can start to see in the marketplace in the near future. Well, I'd say there's three things to just think about for the second half. One is that you normally have a stronger second half in our industry. We expect that to be the case. Second is we'll have worked through a lot of the inventory issues as you go first half to second half. And we are seeing some green shoots in the marketplace. We think it's a tough market for all, right? And we're navigating through it well, as seen by our top and bottom line beat in Q1. But hey, it's a tough market out there. So we're still being fairly cautious as we look out over time. And then third, obviously, our strengthening execution. Our road map is getting stronger. We're gaining market share. And I think of our Q1 as a solid proof point that we're navigating through the tough environment that we have in a better way than most. So we are incrementally more positive on the second half, but we also believe we have to continue careful execution, careful fiscal discipline as we go through a very uncertain macro outlook. Yes. And a couple of things here, Vivek. One is the announcement that we did with Arm this quarter around IFS, it was a strong ecosystem statement for our foundry offerings and one that was focused around the mobile platform, but we do expect that we'll have a broader play over time as the announcement indicated that it's first focused on mobile, where Arm has proven considerable strength across the market. I'd also say that we think of the market and the future of four architectures matter. Arm, RISC-V, x86, right, you're playing a critical role and the role of accelerators in GPU, right? And we'll be participating across all of those, whether that's through foundry or through our product offerings. I've continued to view that if we are doing a great job with our road map that the role of Arm in the data center will be limited, right? And particularly with the E-core product line that we've laid now laid out with Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest and strong products coming thereafter, we believe that we now deliver power performance TCO benefit at x86. Migrating software stacks in the data center is a lot of work, right? And if I give customers an easy path with x86 and E-core solutions with superior TCO alternatives, that will do very well. So with that, that's our primary play. At the same time, our foundry play will become one, come all. We will manufacture, right, any of the RISC-V arm, x86 and GPU alternatives for the industry through our superior capabilities in our foundry offerings over time. We view this as an industry play of great significance and one that we're committed to competing for leadership wafers across every architecture, every segment of the industry. Yes. And I would just add on top of that, this is something we're working. We're engaging right now with the Department of Commerce and working through our grant applications in that area. We have modeled a certain level in the guidelines that Dave said. Obviously, we're going to be working to do better than that in this regard. And fundamentally, the CHIPS Act is all about making U.S. manufacturing competitive in the world. And that's the focus that we have and the intent of Congress as was laid out, and we hope to get those done as quickly as possible. We also had a major milestone with the EU CHIPS Act passing Parliament last week, and we continue to work on that front. And obviously, skip an investment tax credit. We're working to make our capital intensity and efficiency to be a great opportunity for us to bring shareholder returns in a meaningful way. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, let me say thank you. We're grateful that you joined us. We're grateful that we have the opportunity to give you an update on our business and the progress that we're making. While the macro is challenging and plenty of headwinds out there, we also believe that our execution on our financials will be on top of bottom line, great execution on our process and product road maps. And here we are two years into my tenure, and the journey to date has had some unexpected bumps in the road. We're also beginning to see clear points that increase my confidence that we have the right strategy, the right team, and we are executing on this transformation. And we look forward to updating you throughout the quarter and our next call together. So thank you all so much."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove solid business execution in the first quarter, beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. Against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic volatility, we will continue to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively manage expenses near term, and drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure long-term. First quarter revenue was $11.7 billion, $700 million above the midpoint of our guide. Results from CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye exceeded our expectations, partially offset by softer demand in the Network and Edge markets, impacting NEX revenue in the quarter. Gross margin was 38.4%, modestly below our guidance on higher-than-expected inventory reserves tied to continued macro uncertainty. Q1 margins were impacted 300 basis points by factory underload charges taken in the period. EPS was negative $0.04 for the quarter, $0.11 cents better than guide, demonstrating our cross-company focus on spending discipline. Operating cash flow in Q1 was negative $1.8 billion, net CapEx was $7 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $8.8 billion, and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $27 billion and a strong investment-grade profile. Before moving to Business Unit results, I will highlight a few changes made within our segment reporting. The Client and Data Center focused products from the former AXG business are now reported within our CCG and DCAI segments, respectively, and will have a dilutive effect on the operating margins of those businesses. Our Silicon Photonics and Foundry Automotive businesses have moved out of NEX and IFS, respectively, and are now reported as part of all other revenue, sharpening our focus on the significant market opportunities available to both NEX and IFS. Shifting to the first-quarter business unit results. CCG achieved revenue of $5.8 billion, better than our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to see a challenging demand environment, especially in our Consumer and Education segments, customers continue to prefer Intel, driven by our leadership product performance. As discussed last quarter, we saw a significant inventory burn at our customers in the period. While inventory levels remain elevated, we anticipate the market will be closer to equilibrium as we exit Q2. ASPs were down sequentially due to mix. Q1 operating profit was $520 million, flat sequentially despite revenue declining 13% from Q4, and down year-over-year on lower revenue, higher unit costs and excess capacity charges, partially offset by reduced OpEx. DCAI revenue was $3.7 billion, ahead of our expectations in Xeon, PSG and AXG lines of business. We saw a significant sequential and year-over-year TAM contraction across all CPU market segments and expect demand to remain soft in the second quarter. We saw stable CPU market share in Q1 and are excited by the broad market ramp of our 4th Generation Xeon Scalable processor: Sapphire Rapids. Operating loss was $518 million, impacted sequentially by lower revenue, higher product costs and investment in leadership products on new process nodes. DCAI margins were also diluted by the merge of the AXG business and inventory reserves tied to the exit of our Server System business. Within our DCAI business, the Programmable Solutions Group delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter in Q1, up 36% year-over-year, with increased ASPs and improved external supply, which enables us to satisfy customer backlog, helping to drive continued operating profit growth. NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, below our expectations for the quarter, driven by demand softness and elevated inventory levels in our Network and Edge markets, consistent with the overall industry. Operating loss was $300 million, impacted sequentially by depressed revenue in the quarter and inventory reserves, partially offset by continued expense management and discipline. Mobileye continues to outperform underlying Automotive end-markets, delivering record first-quarter revenue of $458 million, up 16% year-over-year, along with a 6% year-over-year increase in content per vehicle. Profitability continues to be strong with Q1 operating income of $123 million. IFS revenue was $118 million, including 67% sequential growth in Packaging revenue. Operating loss was $140 million, impacted sequentially by increased factory startup costs as we invest in a strategic growth business. We're well on our way towards our committed $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023, on our path to $8 billion to $10 billion of reductions, exiting 2025, which will exclude benefits from the change in Equipment Useful Life. As demonstrated by our Q1 results, focused investment prioritization and spending discipline have our OpEx reductions trending ahead of expectation. While revenue-adjusted cost-of-sales reductions faced headwinds from factory underload charges and inventory reserves due to continued demand uncertainty. As Pat highlighted, our shift to an Internal Foundry model is already demonstrating a path to the structural cost improvements necessary to achieve our long-term profit goals. We've seen early wins with a reduction in disruptive factory expedites, an increased focus on sort and test times. We look forward to unpacking the financial and operational benefits of our Internal Foundry model in much more detail in our Investor webinar later in the quarter. Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect second-quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. At the midpoint of $12 billion, we expect billings to continue to trail consumption in our Data Center, Network and Client markets as customers focus on rightsizing operating inventories. While we remain cautious, we're seeing green shoots and expect sequential revenue growth throughout the year. Pat mentioned the continued strong signals of elevated PC usage and active devices, giving us confidence that our short-term headwinds are an anomaly to long-term revenue opportunity. Demand for AI capabilities in the Cloud, across the Network and at the Edge continue to grow, and we're confident that our CPU and Accelerator portfolios are well-positioned to benefit from the market tailwind. We're forecasting Q2 gross margin of 37.5%, a tax rate of 13%, an EPS of negative $0.04 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q2 gross margins by approximately 300 basis points. While gross margins are well below acceptable levels, I'd highlight inventory reserves on pre-PRQ products impact Q2 margins by approximately 250 basis points, costs, which should begin to unwind later this year as new products launch. Increased sample costs in support of our Xeon product road map will impact margins by 40 basis points sequentially. Our Q2 guidance includes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating margin from the useful life accounting change we announced in January, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to OpEx, up from $460 million in Q1. It's important to remember that this is a fixed cost business. The impact of underloaded factories goes beyond the period charges we're seeing in the first half of the year and will be felt for several quarters as we sell through products with higher average unit costs. We'll continue to deploy factory capacity prudently as we operate within our smart capital framework. As communicated last quarter, we expect to manage net CapEx intensity in the low 30% of revenue range in 2023, with capital offsets of approximately 20% to 30% of gross CapEx. Consistent with smart capital, IFS capacity represents approximately 10% of 2023 gross CapEx, a number which will scale in line with foundry customer commitments. With gross CapEx weighted to first half and capital offsets weighted to second half, we expect adjusted free cash flow to improve sequentially throughout the year and to be positive in second half of 2023. While we're encouraged by first quarter revenue and expect growth to improve sequentially through 2023, we're not satisfied with our financial results and remain focused on what we can control. Our execution and the prioritization of our owner's capital toward our long-term goals. We're confident that as we deliver on our road map commitments, we will meet and exceed our customers' expectations for our products and our owners' expectations for strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Yes. Sure, Tim. Let me give you a little color. So on the 250 basis points that you correctly highlight that are the pre-PRQ reserves, the benefit of that is as we go into the back half of the year, that's related to Meteor Lake and Emerald. And as those ship, a lot of that reverses. In fact, in essence, we end up shipping it at 100% gross margin. So that becomes a tailwind. And then we do expect, as things improve from a demand perspective, that we will start to load the fab back up. The only, I guess, cautionary comment is that we still have under-loaded costs that kind of are built into the cost of our product that are held in inventory. And so there are -- it does take a few quarters even beyond the time where we start to stop seeing these period costs of underutilization that we'll start to still see some cost headwinds from that. But ultimately, we'll be loading the fabs up to the appropriate levels, and that will be a nice tailwind. So maybe the best way to describe it is, I think, for the back half of the year, we feel like we'll be comfortably in the 40s from a gross margin perspective based on all those factors. And obviously, we're actively working on our $8 billion to $10 billion of spending reductions by the time we get to the end of 2025, and a lot of that is in the cost base, which will be a benefit to gross margins. Yes. So we have about 155 days of inventory aggregate - in the aggregate on the balance sheet. Obviously, as we get through the inventory depletion at customers and we start to normalize back up to the level of end consumption, we'll start to burn through that inventory, and you can expect us to start ramping the factories. I don't think we'll be fully ramped by the end of the year, but we certainly will be improving the ramp through the year. Yes, okay. So on the pre-PRQ, you're right, and it always is lumpy. We saw this effect midway through last year with Sapphire Rapids. And so, we will have these on occasion. But we think for the second half of the year, for sure, we won't see this magnitude of pre-PRQ reserves is a pretty significant quarter for us in the second quarter. On the under-loading charges, I think it's -- partially, it's about revenue, but partially it's about our inventory levels and where they are. So we obviously need to bring the inventory levels down from the 155 days. That's going to be important. I think I would just say that, hey, in the third and fourth quarter, I would see - I would expect to see an improving situation in terms of underloads. And likely, that will be behind us by the time we're through the end of the year, just on the period cost under load charges. We might be living with some higher cost per unit for a couple of quarters after that, because of under-load that we built into the cost of the products. But ultimately, we'll have this factory, the factory network loaded back up. Yes, Pierre, how are you? Yes. So I'll take some of it, and then you... Maybe like at a high level, Pierre, maybe the way to think about it is, look, one element of getting to the appropriate cost structure to deliver the margins is getting our process technology to be competitive. And that's really at 18A where we intersect that. So we make improvements along the way, but that's really where we make the meaningful improvement to get there from a process perspective. Now the challenge is all along the way, there's this kind of start-up costs that we have to deal with, which is hundreds of basis points of headwind for us that we have, by virtue of the fact that we're stacked on stacked. The five nodes in four years that Pat is driving is the right strategy, but it does create headwinds on the cost side. So that - we've got to work our way through that, but once we're on the other side of five nodes in four years, we have a competitive process technology from a cost perspective. We've gotten ourselves this, let's say, significantly higher startup costs that we are incurring behind us as well. And then as you point out, you have the benefits of the scale of revenue that we would expect. And then lastly, you have, as Pat was talking about, this whole notion of the internal foundry model, which just drives a lot of attention on cost and where we think we're going to get a lot of that $8 billion to $10 billion of savings exiting 2025. So I think, the way I look at it at least is that we put forth a model for gross margins. We changed the depreciation, which incrementally raises that target. And there's nothing that's going on at the company that would suggest that we're off pace from that. We think we are going to achieve that. The timing is obviously a function somewhat of the market. But other than that, we feel like we're on a great path to have those margins. Yes. I think what Pat said is, we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year. And that, combined with the fact that pre-PRQ reserves reverse themselves, we'll probably see some better utilization levels. That's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s, and we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half? Yes. Gross would be north of $20 million. We think, as I mentioned, that we can keep net CapEx intensity in kind of the low 30s as a percent of revenue, which is kind of within our model actually a little bit better than what we modeled during the capital-intensive phase of our transformation. As it relates to kind of the split, we are probably -- certainly, there's a lot of CapEx going to equipment. There's a lot of CapEx going to shells. We're probably a little bit more biased towards shell investment right now. We had been in the past behind, and that caught us. And these are obviously the very long lead time type investments. And so you want to be -- make sure you have a shell when you need it. And so we have biased ourselves to do that and to make the investments that are appropriate in that regard. And as you point out, as I said, it's largely around our own needs. We are making some modest investments on the foundry side right now as we start to get -- gain traction on the customer front. And as we get more customers, we'll ramp that investment as appropriate. I mean, this is our current outlook is somewhere in the 20% to 30%. It obviously can get better. It assumes that we will have another skip by the end of the year and some government incentives. But obviously, I've got the CEO out there managing the offsets. And so I think there's certainly opportunity to see upside, if not this year, next year. And keep in mind, next year, we'll also have the benefit of the investment tax credit coming in at that point, which will obviously be helpful."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP and segment financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP and segment financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that let me turn things over to Pat.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. We delivered Q3 revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and we made significant progress on our cost reduction plan. That said, Q3 profitability was negatively impacted by the charges we referenced on our Q2 call. This reflects the aggressive actions we are taking to lower our cost, improve our efficiency, and enhance our market competitiveness. Dave will go into these charges in detail shortly. Operationally, Q3 results exceeded our expectations as we achieved key milestones across Intel Foundry and Intel Products. Underlying trends in the business are improving at a measured pace, and our outlook for Q4 is modestly above current consensus. Overall, our stepped up focus on efficiency and execution across business is having a positive impact. We have a lot more ahead and we are acting with urgency to deliver on our priorities. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before and our teams are embracing this mindset as we build a leaner, more profitable Intel. Now, let me provide more details starting with an update on our cost reduction plan that we announced three months ago. First, we completed the vast majority of our headcount actions during Q3 and we are on track to our greater than 15% workforce reduction before the end of the year. These were hard but necessary changes that are reducing complexity and making us a leaner, faster and more agile company. Second, we have reduced our capital expenditures by over 20% relative to the plan we had entering the year. We are now well positioned with our shell ahead strategy to react quickly to market demand. With our transition to EUV now complete and the launch of Intel 18A on the horizon, we have a more normal cadence of node development at Intel 14A and beyond. In addition, our teams are maniacally focused on improving fab productivity, allowing us to produce more with less over time. Third, we have begun to simplify and streamline parts of our portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. We are re-establishing product portfolio leadership by narrowing our focus on fewer projects with the top priority being to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across the client, edge and data center markets. As part of our portfolio simplification, we will move our Edge business into CCG and refocus our NEX portfolio on networking and telco. We will also integrate our software business into our core business units to foster more integrated solutions that address our customers' most difficult challenges. We are evaluating other portfolio actions which we will communicate when appropriate and we plan to provide new segment reporting that reflects these portfolio shifts in Q1 of 2025. Related to our cost and efficiency actions, the restructuring charges we took in Q3 were significant and necessary to right-size the company as we reduced spending by over $10 billion in 2025. There was also a sizable impairment mostly related to Intel 7 equipment and space reflecting excess COVID era spending that we have concluded cannot migrate to more advanced nodes now that we have fully transitioned to EUV processing. From a broader financial perspective, the actions we took in Q3 go a long way towards delivering the 2025 financial commitments we outlined last quarter. Specifically, we plan to reduce non-product cost of sales by $1 billion lower OpEx to $17.5 billion and drive gross and net CapEx to between $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion respectively. We expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive next year and we will focus on decreasing leverage and improving liquidity. Let me go into greater detail on the business starting with Intel Products. We continue to focus on our core x86 franchise and the ecosystems we have developed over 40 plus years of investing. They are a tangible source of value and differentiation for Intel, our partners and our collective customers, and help to cement the x86 architecture as uniquely positioned to meet customer demands going forward. We are taking steps to supercharge and further unlock the value of our x86 franchise. We intend to drive new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future demands of next-generation computing and we see this unlocking a range of meaningful opportunities across all our businesses. I am particularly excited about our recent announcement with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group. We are bringing together leaders from across the ecosystem to help shape the future of x86 with a focus on simplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and interface consistency across vendors and equipment developers with standardized architectural tools and guidelines. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat have signed on as founding members as have industry luminaries, Linus Torvalds and Tim Sweeney. Turning to our product segments, in CCG, we continue to lead the AI PC category. In September at IFA, we launched our Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors formerly named Lunar Lake. This is the most efficient family of x86 processors ever created, setting a new standard for mobile AI performance and significantly out performing competitor platforms. Lunar Lake's combination of superior performance at comparable and competitive battery life positions us well to continue to define and lead the AI PC category. We also continue to nurture the most robust AI PC ecosystem in the industry with more than 100 ISVs, 300 applications and 500 AI models powered by Core Ultra and we remain on track to ship more than a 100 million AI PCs accumulative by the end of 2025. Next up is Arrow Lake, which launched earlier this month and brings the power of the AI PC to the desktop, delivering a huge leap in performance per watt and bringing an NPU to enthusiast desktop and entry workstation platforms for the first time. All of this is paving the way toward the launch of Panther Lake in the second half of 2025. Panther Lake will be our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a more performant and cost competitive process that will allow us to bring more wafers home and improve overall profitability. Overall, we are making good progress in CCG. Our share position is strong with a product roadmap and ecosystem that is increasingly setting us apart from our competition, especially in the enterprise market as customers continue to see increasing value from our vPro solutions. Turning to DCAI, our focus is squarely on delivering powerful AI systems that provide enterprise customers with greater choice and flexibility, optimal performance per watt, and lower total cost of ownership and this quarter's launches significantly enhance our market competitiveness even as we recognize we have more work to do. We launched our latest Xeon 6 product code-named Granite Rapids, which doubles the performance of the prior gen with increased core counts, memory bandwidth and embedded AI acceleration. The new Xeon 6 is tailor-made to handle compute intensive workloads with exceptional efficiency from edge to data center and cloud environments. This solidifies our position as the head node of choice in AI servers. Greater than 70% of [Technical Difficulty] servers are already using Intel Xeon as the host CPU and we have a significant opportunity to build on this as we continue re-establishing Xeon's competitive strength and market leadership. This quarter, we also launched our Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which delivers twice the networking bandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor for large language model efficiency. While the Gaudi 3 benchmarks have been impressive and we are pleased by our recent collaboration with IBM to deploy Gaudi 3 as a service on IBM Cloud. The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use. As a result, we will not achieve our target of 500 million in revenue for Gaudi in 2024. That said, taking a longer term view, we remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is clear need for solutions with superior TCO based on open standards and we are continuing to enhance the Gaudi value proposition. In NEX, we announced last month that we will be focusing the business on networking and telco as part of our efforts to simplify our portfolio, drive productivity, and enhance our market position. We will move our Edge business into CCG, which creates a meaningful opportunity to more efficiently leverage our core client business and extend our leadership to a wide range of vertical edge solutions, especially as AI on the edge accelerates. As a simpler, more focused NEX, we are better positioned to gain profitable share in the most attractive markets. In Networking, we continue to further Open Source Ethernet solutions for connectivity through our Ultra Accelerator Link and Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Let me now turn to Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership through disciplined execution of our roadmap. Intel 18A, our fifth node in four years is healthy and continues to progress well at this stage in the development process. Our lead vehicles for Intel 18A, Panther Lake, and Clearwater Forest have met early 18A milestones ahead of next year's launches. In addition, we have seen good traction with the release of our 1.0 PDK last quarter and the material increase in the engagements and the number of RFQs we are actively quoting. While we will not win them all, we are confident in our head-to-head position based on feedback from potential customers. Most recently, as announced, we are finalizing a multiyear, multibillion dollar commitment by AWS to expand our existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 and the new AI fabric chip on Intel 18A. Beyond AWS, we added two additional 18A wafer design wins this quarter from compute centric companies and our pipeline of potential wafer designs has grown nicely over the quarter. Given our leadership and advanced packaging capabilities, we also added multiple backend design wins this quarter. We were also awarded an additional 3 billion in direct funding under the Secure Enclave program to produce leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. We are proud to be the US government's Partner of Choice to fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure the US maintains its leadership in advanced manufacturing microelectronic systems and process technology. Moving forward, as we shared last month, we are creating clearer separation for Intel Foundry by establishing the business as an independent subsidiary. This is important to our external foundry customers and will give us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products. We are in the process of forming a fiduciary board for the new foundry subsidiary, which will include independent directors with deep semiconductor experience. In our all other category, our number one priority is to unlock shareholder value. For Altera, revenue increased 14% sequentially and operating profit turned positive in Q3. We also announced the introduction of our new mid-range and small form factor products, Agilex 5 and Agilex 3 to serve broad market customers and segments. With an increasingly competitive roadmap, the business is well-positioned to show continued top and bottom line improvements. Consistent with what we have said previously, we remain focused on selling a stake in Altera on a path to its IPO in the coming years. To that end, we have begun discussions with potential investors and expect to conclude in early 2025. For Mobileye, the company continues to be a leader in the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems and by providing Mobileye with separation and autonomy, we have enhanced its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and accelerate its path to creating even greater value. The company recently hosted an AI event laying out a comprehensive strategy for camera-centric compound AI systems providing a full range of autonomous driving solutions. Wrapping up, our Q3 results reflect heightened focus, discipline and execution you can expect moving forward. We are rigorously managing our costs and improving our profitability to create long-term shareholder value. We are carefully managing our cash to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity and we are staying closely connected with customers and partners as we innovate to meet their most challenging needs. Q3 also reflected some very difficult decisions we made to right-size the business and I want to recognize the hard work of our employees. We put some points on the board over the past few months, but we are far from satisfied. We view every quarter as a new opportunity to up our game and continue to execute well and that is our mindset entering Q4. With that, I will now turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $13.3 billion up 4% sequentially and in the upper half of the range we provided in August. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered sequential revenue growth, even as we navigated an inventory drawdown in client. Turning to non-GAAP gross margin, as you know, last quarter, we guided gross margins of 38%, but indicated that we expected incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan and some of those costs would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin. We recognized approximately $3 billion of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges, primarily for Intel 7, which are above and beyond our quarter-to-quarter asset adjustments, driving our non-GAAP gross margin down to 18% and EPS to a loss of $0.46. This $3 billion charge reduced non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 2,300 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.61 per share. Beyond those impairment charges, we also were impacted by $15.6 billion of charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. These charges have three main components. First, we impaired our deferred tax asset balance by nearly $10 billion which was triggered by cumulative GAAP based losses over the last three years. Second, a $2.6 billion goodwill impairment related to Mobileye, which shows up in our consolidated earnings. And lastly is $2.2 billion associated with the severance of approximately 15% of our employees, aligned with our plan to reduce operating expenses to $17.5 billion and take out $1 billion of other cost of sales next year. This last charge is the only charge with a cash impact. The tax asset impairment charge will not affect cash taxes going forward and full details are in the 10-Q, which will be available tomorrow. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.1 billion up approximately $1.8 billion sequentially on better working capital. We had growth CapEx of $6.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion. We expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring charges to land in Q4 2024. We have $24.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, paid down $2.8 billion of debt in the quarter and remain focused on delevering next year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results, Intel Products revenue was $12.2 billion up 3% sequentially. CCG revenue was down 1% quarter-over-quarter as customers worked down their inventory as expected. DCAI revenue was up 10% sequentially, as demand for traditional servers improved. Revenue for NEX was up double-digit sequentially, as elements of this business start to recover off a cyclical bottom. Q3 operating profit for Intel Products was $3.3 billion, 27% of revenue and up $400 million quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Operating income was negatively impacted by a $300 million write-down of accelerator inventory due to reduced revenue expectations. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion up slightly sequentially, driven by increased wafer mix of Intel 4, 3. Foundry operating loss of $5.8 billion was down sequentially materially driven by the $3 billion impairment charges I discussed earlier. We expect losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q4, minus this impairment charge. Next year, as we move to nodes with a better cost structure and realize the savings associated with the restructuring actions, we expect operating losses to improve significantly. Additionally, we are intensely focused on driving improved returns on our roughly $80 billion of tangible book value, most of which is associated with Intel Foundry. Mobileye reported revenue of $485 million and maintained full year guidance for revenue and adjusted operating income. Q3 revenue was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by a more than 50% reduction in shipments to China, where comparisons will become easier as the exposure is now significantly smaller. Cash generation was quite strong, as operating cash flow was well above operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $412 million up 14% sequentially, consistent with guidance to support improved lead times by our distribution partners. Operating margins increased sequentially by 900 basis points on better gross margins and spending discipline. For Q4, we expect high-single-digit sequential revenue growth, as we work with our distribution partners to prepare for the cutover to Altera independent warehouse operations. Overall, billings remain below consumption, as end customers continue to work down inventory tied to previous supply constraints. We anticipate inventory normalization will continue through the first half of next year. Now turning to our Q4 guidance. We successfully worked down client customer inventory levels in Q3, in line with our expectations and despite continued client customer inventory reductions in Q4, CCG should grow towards the higher end of seasonal, often abnormal Q3. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially across DCAI and NEX businesses in aggregate. Based on these factors, we expect revenue of $13.3 million to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of $13.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 39.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.12, all on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, as we continue to execute on our cost actions and portfolio decisions, we expect additional restructuring charges in Q4. We continue to size the business to support trend line revenue growth of 3% to 5% annually with the ability to scale up to 7% to 9% as demand dictates. We anticipate that our 2024 gross and net capital investments will be approximately $25 billion and $11 billion respectively. Our expectation is for adjusted free cash flow to be negative in 2024 due to the restructuring charges disclosed today and the uncertainty around the timing of capital offsets as we approach year-end. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and gross and net CapEx of $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion, respectively, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. Before I close, let me take a moment to remind you of a couple of items as you model 2025 and that today's restructuring and impairment charges are in service to achieve this financial model. First, we are positive on the growing market adoption of the AI PC and our strong product positioning. As our mix of outsourced products and CCG grows in calendar year 2025 and we ramp Intel 18A to support Panther Lake, gross margin expansion could be muted, particularly in the second half. We expect gross margin fall-through to significantly improve in 2026 driven by the vastly improved cost structure of Intel 18A, the return of tiles to a meaningfully underutilized Intel Foundry and operational efficiencies. Second, the estimated $700 million on a GAAP basis of noncontrolled income from Mobileye, Altera, IMS and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners is expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of 2025 and will continue to grow in future years with the ramping of wafer outs at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland. In closing, our profitability remains well below the standards we've set and recognize there's much more work to be done to improve the efficiency of the business. We're encouraged by the progress we made this quarter to rightsize the spending, and our process and product execution, combined with a strong external customer traction in the quarter, give us confidence our strategy will deliver compelling shareholder returns. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.\nA - John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on solid results. Pat, I want to talk about the 18A transition. Can you just talk about what are the metrics we're going to be able to see externally on this to give people confidence and the ability to ramp it? You've said it's healthy. You've talked about new design wins. But when are some of the true metrics going to come either internally or perhaps even more importantly, externally as your Intel Foundry revenue from an external customer base grows?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ross. And obviously this was a good quarter on the progress that we had, three new customers, Amazon, which we were public on a few weeks ago, Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest internally, two new external customers added to that. So solid progress on it. Clearly, next year, there's not a lot of financial benefit from it because we're only ramping late in the year. Thus, we'll be giving more qualitative metrics on progress as we go through the year, Ross. We'll continue to update, give LDV updates, lifetime deal value for foundry updates as we go through the year. Clearly, as we get more customers, we'll be updating on that progress. It has much larger impacts on '26 financials as we ramp and bring wafers home as well as move into the better margin structure that we'll have on Panther Lake with 18A and across the product line. So we'll be giving clarity in that way, but it will be hard to tie it to specific financials next year, but this is super important for us. For our foundry business, for the industry. So we'll be giving plenty of color as we proceed.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a follow-up question, please?\nRoss Seymore: Yes, I do. One for Dave on the gross margin side of things. Just somewhat chronologically, ex the charges, it looks like you're about a 41% gross margin in the second or excuse me the third quarter. I know that's not where you want to be overall, but that's much better than you guided. So what was the cause of the upside there? Why is it going down in the fourth quarter? And what are the big picture puts and takes that you're alluding to about the gross margin leverage or lack thereof, especially as we get into the second half of next year?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question. Okay. So I would say the third quarter surprise was really associated with better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. I think that was the thing that upsided us the most in the third quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we'll have that better sell-through won't repeat itself. So that will be a fundamental driver of why the gross margins kind of slipped down absent the impairment charge. And additionally, we're going to have more start-up costs in the fourth quarter associated with 18A than we did in the third quarter. So that's going to put a little pressure on the gross margins. But I do think the 39.5% guide at the midpoint for the fourth quarter is a pretty clean guide. It has less kind of noise around it than some of the previous quarters. So I think it's a good kind of metric to kind of start to inform how '25 will look in terms of gross margins. We're not going to provide guidance yet on '25. It's still early. I would say the puts and takes of it are, for sure, as Pat indicated, we're all in on AI PC and in particular, we're all in on Lunar Lake, which is our next-generation product. As you know, Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, that affects the gross margins, and I think it's going to weigh down the gross margins on the product side of the business for us in '25. Now as you know, Panther Lake is the next one, the margins get better just at the product level, but they also include more mix of wafers internally, which also helps the foundry business. So as we get more volume ramping in '26 and Panther Lake, that's going to be helpful for gross margins. On the Foundry side, we will see improvement next year. You won't see it because we don't report it at that level, but we will see gross margin improvement on the Foundry side as we step into '25, partly because of the reductions we talked about. As we talked about, we're going to reduce our spending by more than $10 billion, $1 billion of it is directly in cost of sales associated with the Intel Foundry business getting more efficient in terms of their spend. Additionally, we're just going to be mixing more to EUV wafers. EUV wafers have a better pricing dynamic, they have a better cost structure on a relative basis. So we see improvement there. And I've been pleased with just the new model of managing the Foundry business with a P&L. I've seen all kinds of better decision-making going on, both at Foundry and at the Product side just to optimize their cost structure in a better way, and that should help as well. Longer term, I just think as we continually improve our product portfolio, both in Foundry and Products, that usually commands a better margin profile and also longer term be a tailwind. But not yet, I think, something that shows up meaningfully in '25.\nPatrick Gelsinger: And I would just add that, as we indicated on our last quarter's earnings call, as we go through this restructuring phase, we're in the next phase of our transformation. With that, we're much more focused on the sustainable business model results, shareholder return, financial disciplines. The first phase is very much about getting back in the game. Getting process in place, getting shell ahead in place, getting our products competitive. So I think overall, Ross, we're going to be much more focused on it. Those are the tough actions we've taken this quarter on getting our cost base where we need to be. And overall, the operating margin, the gross margins of the company, overall cost base, CapEx investment, they're just getting a lot more attention from us as we go forward.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Pat, I think you mentioned at a conference maybe in September that defect density on 18A is you said sub 0.4, I think. Can you just talk about how that translates to yields? Is that sort of a good enough number to translate into high volume? And what sort of number for, say, defect density does a customer want to see when they're looking at your foundry?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Defect density, it's a complex conversation, Tim, because that big die sizes have lower percent yields, right, even at the same defect density. So it's very variable depending on the particular die size of the product. So when we said the D0 of less than 0.4, that was a healthy yield number at this phase of the process development, that's not yet a high-volume production yield level. But we're not at that phase of the process development yet for 18A. So it's a number that says we are at where we'd want to be at this point in the process development life cycle. Clearly, as you bring it to high-volume production, which we'll be doing in the second half of next year, we have to be markedly lower than that in terms of defect density. But we believe that we see all the signs, the signals, and we're managing this very carefully to accomplish that as we get to next year. Similarly, as we look at today's Intel 3, we're accomplishing the defect densities with the maturity levels that we'd expect on that. But again, yield in the process technology is something you're never done with, right? You hit key milestones on quality yield and then you go into high-volume production and you continue to work on that going forward. I'd also emphasize that the Arizona ramp is important for us as we move to 18A. And that comes online in volume in the second half of next year and that's all on track as well as we have tool move-ins, EUV tools and qualification now, first wafers coming out of the volume fab in Arizona in Q1 of next year. So overall, we're progressing well, and we'll be giving you updates as we proceed.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question?\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. Yes. I have a question on Panther Lake, Pat. So I know that it's coming back in-house, but we do still hear that most tiles are still being outsourced. Can you speak to that? Is that a change or was that always the plan? And I guess when you look at Nova Lake on the desktop side, is it still being dual track, meaning that there is still an option that it could be outsourced or is it guaranteed to be brought back in-house? Thanks.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. Panther Lake, some tiles would be external, but the majority of the millimeter square in the package are back internal. It's more 70% plus of the silicon area is back in-house. So the majority of Panther Lake wafer capacity by a good margin is coming back inside for Intel. Nova Lake, we definitely have some SKUs that we're looking at continuing to leverage externally, but the large majority of Nova Lake and more of the additional tiles have come back in-house as well. So we still have some flexibility in the Nova Lake product, but the large majority of that is committed to the Intel Product or Intel Foundry. So overall, we are absolutely executing on the bringing wafer's home strategy that we've laid out. That said, TSMC has been a great partner. Clearly, Lunar Lake has demonstrated the strength of the partnership and one that we'll use selectively in our product lines for the future. But a large percentage of wafers coming home that meaningfully fills our factories that also meaningfully improves the margin structure of Intel and Intel Products.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow on that last question. In terms of the optionality in terms of securing leading-edge capacity, obviously, you're all in on 18A. But if that were to get delayed, what do you have in terms of negotiated capabilities in terms of securing capacity in '26, '27. And on the other hand, if 18A proves to be more successful, how are you thinking about timeframe being more aggressive in terms of adding capacity in Arizona?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, C.J. I'll say we have optionality in the product portfolio that way. We have more resilience in our supply chain than competition does as a result. So we feel quite good about that. We continue to really value the relationship, right, with TSMC and our product portfolio is set up very nicely with respect to 18A capacity. Given our shell ahead strategy and the investments that we've made over the last several years, we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if market conditions require for our products, but also if market conditions require for our Foundry customers as well. And given the margin stacking nature that we uniquely are able to benefit from every wafer we bring home adds to the margin structure of Intel in a meaningful way. So we really are setting ourselves up very nicely for the future. And as we make progress on 18A,18AP, 14A, an aggressive road map, advanced packaging, which is uniquely based on Intel technologies and finding more momentum in our product line, but also in our Foundry customers, we really are starting to see the benefits of the long-term strategy that we've put in place with Intel Products with Intel Foundry.\nJohn Pitzer: C.J., do you have a follow-up question?\nC.J. Muse: I do. Following the better the consensus guide for Q4, could you give us an early read on how you're thinking about seasonality into Q1?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So we're not going to provide, C.J., guidance for Q1. Let's work on Q4, and we can update you in January. But the average seasonality for Q1 is in the 8% to 10% range and we'll give you more color as we get into next quarter's earnings, whether we are going to be seasonal or see things differently than that.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And I'd say, overall, it's hard to say. We have geopolitical factors and other things that the world is looking at and I don't think we have any wisdom beyond that at this point. We're clearly trying to manage the business to a cost structure that we're very comfortable with. But as we indicated by the last question, C.J., we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if necessary or we have the opportunity to do that as well. And overall, there's quite a bit of uncertainty, I think, in the marketplace, so our strategy positions us well to deal with those overall uncertainties that we don't control, but we're very committed to control what we can directly do.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I wanted to go back to 2025 and how we should kind of conceptually look at it. I think at one point, in the trend line of 3% to 5% growth top line. Is that how we should think about sales? And then on the gross margin side, Dave, you said that muted expansion, right. And if I look at your Q4 of 39.5%, is that sort of what you imply for 2025? And I asked that because I think at some other point, you also mentioned headwinds in the second half of '25. So that got me confused as to whether it could dip below these levels. So just I know you're not giving '25 outlook, but you did give a trend line number and you did kind of give us the 39.5% metric. So any color would be very useful.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So on revenue growth, again, we're not going to, for 2025, I'd say just that we are managing the business in terms of how we're investing in the business to a 3% to 5% growth rate next year, but over time, in our minds. And things turn out to be better, then that's good fall through to us from a profitability perspective. I wasn't suggesting that you take the 39.5%, you move it every quarter. Clearly, every quarter is going to have some unique aspects to it. Only that 39.5% was a quarter in which it was clean and it was a good proxy to start the calculation for the full year of '25. You're right, yes, we do see more headwind in the second half versus the first half given Lunar Lake becoming a more meaningful part of the volume over time for 2025. Again, that starts to improve in the following year as Panther Lake becomes more and more meaningful part of the volume for the client business in 2026.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up question, please?\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. So maybe one for Pat. Pat, what does the future look like for Intel's data center if there is no competitive AI product. Is just being CPU-centric good enough? At what point does the CPU get commoditized like custom chips or replaced with ARM-based products. What is Intel's AI strategy right now?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Vivek. Maybe three different perspectives just to highlight. Number one is the CPU plays an increasing role in data center AI compute. Even in cloud-based environments today, head nodes are an area of strength for Intel Xeon already, as I reflected in my comments. As you go into enterprise AI, we expect to place a more prominent role, databases, embedding, refinement or much more attuned to CPU workloads. And our strategy there is CPU plus accelerator or CPU plus Gaudi. So we see the enterprise use cases having a very long life associated with them going forward. Second, as I said, Gaudi 3, good product and seeing good early interest from customers. We mentioned the IBM win, but a good pipeline of activities there. So Xeon plus accelerator in that regard. And as we launched this quarter, we also have the x86 Ecosystem Advisory. We are breathing life into the x86 architecture and we're seeing extraordinary interest from the industry, from luminaries and how we build on that momentum. So we definitely want to be very front footed with x86 for a full range of use cases, but also the AI use cases as well and the industry is quite interested in joining us participating and expanding the world's greatest architecture of all time. The most industry influence, the broadest number of ISVs and applications and continuing that momentum forward.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Two questions, if I can as well. So first on the Foundry business as you guys ramp that we start to focus on the ramp of 18A looking forward. Given the pipeline of the design wins that you guys have talked about. I'm curious, how large is your external piece of that, call it, $4.4 billion revenue in this most recent quarter. I think it was about $77 million last quarter. And how do we think about the pace of that kind of inflecting higher as we look out into '25, '26? And I'm just curious how you would define success in that external business?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. So overall the external Foundry business will be a modest portion, right, of the Foundry business for the next couple of years. The Foundry revenues will be dominated by the internal products as we've been building that portfolio for many years. So we'll ramp as we go through the rest of the decade. We said our financial objectives by the end of the decade are $15 billion plus of external Foundry revenue. We'll be giving periodic updates on LDV, lifetime deal value of external Foundry customers as we go forward. And indicators like we did this quarter of new design wins, new customers coming online. But the reported numbers for Intel Foundry will be substantially dominated by the Intel Products for the next couple of years. That said, we saw a nice growth, right, quarter-on-quarter in the external Foundry business and we did break profitable for the advanced packaging portion of that business in Q3. So we are seeing nice growth characteristics, nice business characteristics, and we'll be giving more updates as we go forward. Dave, anything to add on that?\nDavid Zinsner: No, I mean, other than it was up a bit this quarter, but still dominated by internal business within the Intel Foundry business.\nJohn Pitzer: Aaron, do you have a follow-up question?\nAaron Rakers: Yes, I do. Thanks. Real quickly on the server side of the business kind of off the prior question. I guess there's a continual discussion or debate of like Intel's positioning as far as stabilizing or recapturing its share position in x86 service. I'm curious as we think about Granite Rapids, we think about Clearwater Forest and Diamond Rapids. How do you characterize your ability to kind of your views of recapturing share in that server CPU market? Thank you.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. And I'd say our goal is stabilize our position and grow from that position. And this was a solid quarter for our execution. Clearly, Xeon 6, Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest now fully shipping and available are important milestones. Obviously, the AWS deal was a very nice deal because it reinforces Xeon, but also our expanding role of customization. So I'll say the first order of business is hold share and then regain share. The strength that we've seen for Xeon is this AI head nodes, these AI use cases. We have very good performance on Granite Rapids for AI use cases. And as we look to the future, getting just more competitive on basic power performance per core and fighting for share there is clearly the initiatives that we have underway. Clearwater Forest powered on, right, showing health of 18A, Diamond Rapids will shortly go into fab. So the roadmap is in good solid shape as well. So I'd say, overall, we feel that is a good pathway. And if I add to the last question as well for AI, I'd also emphasize that all of the energy has been in training. And all of us all of that associated with cloud-based training. But training is creating the weather model, not using it. And increasingly, I think, every analyst is putting more and more attention to how do we use those models? How do we inferencing against them? How do we retrain for our localized data? How do we complement that with RAG and database embeddings and all of those are areas that are much more CPU-centric. So the strength of our CPU and its unique power in some of these AI use cases as well as something we see the market coming more toward us and the strength that we've traditionally had.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Pat, I have a question on the Foundry side, in particular, the packaging business you have. I know even though there's a lot of skepticism about 18A, but I think you guys have pretty good packaging technology, and it's proven, I believe, if I look at EMIB and Foveros, et cetera. So my question is, given the tightness in the packaging industry right now, I would have thought we would see more interest in your packaging services. So I'm just curious as to why we are not seeing that. Is it because it's, I guess, there must be some nuances of using your packaging with TSM wafers. I'm just curious as to why we are not seeing more interest.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Well, I'd say we do see significant interest in this area and moving your supply chains, though, is complicated and takes qualification time and many of these designs were first designed on CoWAS, and now they're looking at Foveros, and then they're looking at the unique technologies that we have like EMIB as well. So we actually see very good momentum in that area. Now those aren't as revenue-producing as wafer design, so they're not nearly, right, as large in size, but the pipeline of activities is very strong. And the quarter-on-quarter improvements we saw were largely driven by advanced packaging. Most of the external revenue that we'll see, which will be nicely up year-on-year as we go into '25 in the external Foundry will be advanced packaging and we also see healthy margins for that technology as well. So moving supply chain is always hard and slow, but the progress that we've seen already the design wins that we already include in our LDV and then the pipeline of additional designs that we are engaging in, all of us give us great optimism that this becomes a foundational piece of our Foundry business for the long-term. And as I noted in an earlier comment, we did see our advanced packaging now as a profitable business, a standalone by itself as well.\nJohn Pitzer: Srini, do you have a follow-up question?\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, I do. Thank you. I guess a question on the gross margin side, Dave. I guess there are two issues impacting your PC gross margins. One, the wafer outsourcing and the other, you said packaging of the memory. I'm just curious how much of an impact that memory packaging is having on your gross margin? I suppose that helps your ASPs, but I guess it hurts your gross margin percent. So just curious to know how much of an impact that's having. And then maybe for Pat, architecturally, why do we need to, I guess, combine memory in one package? And is this something that's going to be ongoing or is it just a one-off with, I guess, Lunar and Meteor Lake? Thank you.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. And just to be clear, it's exclusive to Lunar Lake, but not Meteor Lake. And it's having a pretty meaningful impact, a significant impact on Lunar Lake's gross margins, and originally we were like a third of the volume in terms of our expectations next year on Lunar Lake when we recognized how important the AI PC market would be and how good this part was competitively. We pushed the volume significantly up. And so that has put some reasonable pressure on the gross margins for the total company.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And maybe architecturally, the second half of that question, Lunar Lake was initially designed to be a niche product that we wanted to achieve highest performance and great battery life, capability, and then AI PC occurred. And with AI PC, it went from being a niche product to a pretty high-volume product. Now relatively speaking, we're not talking about 50 million, 100 million units, but a meaningful portion of our total mix from a relatively small piece of it as well. So as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AI PC category. That's at a volume product and a volume industry like the PC industry, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business. So it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off package in the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off package in the roadmap going forward. And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure specifically around Lunar Lake. But again it's a great product. And we're happy that we have it in the portfolio and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AI PC category.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Srini. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question is on both CapEx and OpEx as you go through next year. And I think you were a bit clear about what the plans are and what the resulting free cash flow is. I guess, Dave, the question is how much flex maybe in those numbers, I guess, as you go through '25 and '26 as well given the fact that you do have to invest in new technology nodes, how much flex is there for changes in market conditions. Also recognize that you don't have very much revenue growth in the plan for that as well.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I think on the $17.5 billion for OpEx, that's a pretty firm plan. I mean, obviously, we can make some adjustments here or there, if necessary. But we think we've rightsized the investments to invest in the most important areas that Pat and the team want to pursue. And so that, I would say, is relatively firm. Maybe there's just a little bit of variability there that we can make adjustments as we kind of progress through the year. The CapEx, there are three components to CapEx. There is what we're going to invest for the process, advancing the process. There's investment associated with this shell ahead and there's investments associated with capacity. We're always going to make those investments to advance the process. That will always be the case. Shell ahead, we will, but we have largely caught up, I think. And so now we're going to be more measured, I think, as we look to increasing our shell capacity. And then capacity itself then becomes the flex, the tooling out of shells, and we're kind of modulating that based on what we see in terms of demand and, of course, managing it relative to cash flow. So there obviously is flexibility there as we progress through the year and into the following year. And our goal is to generate free cash flow to generate adjusted free cash flow next year and there and onwards. So we'll be managing net CapEx accordingly. I guess the one other variable to the net CapEx would be any of the offsets. And of course we're aggressively pursuing offsets, some of which we know will already show up next year. SCIP will be a component of our offsets next year. We're also going to start to see some more meaningful impact from the investment tax credit next year, which we have already baked into the forecast.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Chris, the thing I would, just to add a little bit to that, Chris, would be that now that we've gotten an EUV fleet, right, into our CapEx base, we have a lot more flexibility across that fleet. Largely, the CapEx used for Intel 3, 18A and 14A highly leveraged across it. So we're much more building to overall capacity requirements and not this very rapid 5 nodes, 4 years, get back to a modern fleet of capability. Obviously, the other point to add to that is now that we have finished this 5 nodes, 4 years, we're progressing to a more normal cadence of new technologies as opposed to this racing through capital. So that will also give us additional flexibility. And I'll say largely with the singular exception of high NA, EUV, the equipment bases are almost entirely the same across the 14A node as well. And even at high NA, we've built flexibility into the TD development that we have optionality to include or not include that as a central part of it. So we've built a lot of capacity. Now we're going to leverage that capacity in much more efficient ways for both a overall high-volume manufacturing and a TD leverage going forward.\nJohn Pitzer: Chris, do you have a quick follow-on?\nChris Caso: I do. And I mean it's a good segue in the next question, Pat, and it's I guess a question about your comments on Better Together. And if you could kind of explain the rationale of why you think that's the case, obviously, there's various opinions on that. And if Intel would be willing or has looked at anything strategic beyond what the current plan is right now?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And I'll just say, we're very comfortable that moving to the subsidiary model as we outlined in the last earnings call, it gives us, I'll say, three things that we're aiming for greater operational rate integrity, right, as we create that clear separation, the opportunity to be able to communicate that more clearly and definitively to our external customers and then the potential to fund and manage the capital requirements of Foundry. That said, the vast majority of volumes through the decade come from Intel Products. The synergies of that co-development and customer zero aspect is very substantial as we see it. And the benefits that we get from the overall cash flows and managing the balance sheet of the company as we go forward are highly beneficial as well. So for all those reasons, our simple view is distinct but Better Together.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Chris. Jonathan, we've got time for one last question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. In your opening remarks, you talked about narrowing the product focus and prioritizing x86. Can you talk about, practically speaking, what happens there? Does that mean, are there other areas that you're investing less in to focus more on x86? Is that a mindset shift, organizational shift? Just what do you mean by that?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And there's a lot of details behind it, Joe, but I'll just maybe give a couple of quick examples. We, for instance, create complexity in the server product line E-Cores, P-Cores across different socket types that complexity was maybe appropriate when the business was substantially larger and growing. At its current size, it puts too much complexity on our development as well as our customers and OEM, how many SKUs they're developing. So we've taken steps to simplify the product line, have fewer SKUs to cover the marketplace, and we're focused on the efficiencies associated with that. Similarly, in the client product area, simplifying the roadmap, fewer SKUs to cover it. How are we handling graphics and how that is increasingly becoming a large integrated graphics capabilities. So less need for discrete graphics in the market going forward. So simplifying the roadmap in those areas. And then the steps we took around our CCG and Edge business to be able to bring that together for better reach to the market, leveraging our core investments. So a variety of those, but many others behind that as we get ourselves, I'll say, in fighting shape that allows us to leverage our investments, hit our $17.5 billion OpEx that Dave spoke about and still have a very solid growth in a more profitable way for the future.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-on?\nJoseph Moore: Yes, I do. To the extent that you are kind of prioritizing the x86 leadership that you have. Does anything shift in the IDM 2.0 model? Is it -- they referenced that the arm's length relationship with IFS is still going really well. Like is that still a focus? Is there a benefit to if the focus is more on internal Foundry versus excess to marrying those business more tightly? Just how do you think about that relationship?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And clearly external Foundry, right, requires a different view of how you run and manage that business, but the wafers, the cash flows come from the internal business. So this subsidiary model is a key piece of how we're going to drive that cultural transformation, but still bring the success of an at-scale leading-edge, western-centered Foundry model. That is an extraordinary asset for us, for the industry and for the world. So we're very focused on making that successful. This has been an extraordinary journey to accomplish 5 nodes in 4 years and bring us from years behind to a leadership position in technology. And wow, it's just stunning to see what our TD teams have been able to accomplish there, but we're not done. We have a lot of work in front of us yet. We're well on our way to completing what will be one of the most seminal restructuring in the history, the steps that we took in our financial restructuring this quarter was very critical to be able to bring us to a point that we can say we have the capacity to and driving to long-term shareholder return. So maybe just as we wrap up, thank you, as always for joining the call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress, the actions we've taken. Q3 was a good step. Now we need to finish the year strong and prepare for 2025. We're determined to get it right and I look forward to the updates along the way. Thank you and look forward to speaking to you all again soon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. We delivered Q3 revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and we made significant progress on our cost reduction plan. That said, Q3 profitability was negatively impacted by the charges we referenced on our Q2 call. This reflects the aggressive actions we are taking to lower our cost, improve our efficiency, and enhance our market competitiveness. Dave will go into these charges in detail shortly. Operationally, Q3 results exceeded our expectations as we achieved key milestones across Intel Foundry and Intel Products. Underlying trends in the business are improving at a measured pace, and our outlook for Q4 is modestly above current consensus. Overall, our stepped up focus on efficiency and execution across business is having a positive impact. We have a lot more ahead and we are acting with urgency to deliver on our priorities. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before and our teams are embracing this mindset as we build a leaner, more profitable Intel. Now, let me provide more details starting with an update on our cost reduction plan that we announced three months ago. First, we completed the vast majority of our headcount actions during Q3 and we are on track to our greater than 15% workforce reduction before the end of the year. These were hard but necessary changes that are reducing complexity and making us a leaner, faster and more agile company. Second, we have reduced our capital expenditures by over 20% relative to the plan we had entering the year. We are now well positioned with our shell ahead strategy to react quickly to market demand. With our transition to EUV now complete and the launch of Intel 18A on the horizon, we have a more normal cadence of node development at Intel 14A and beyond. In addition, our teams are maniacally focused on improving fab productivity, allowing us to produce more with less over time. Third, we have begun to simplify and streamline parts of our portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. We are re-establishing product portfolio leadership by narrowing our focus on fewer projects with the top priority being to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across the client, edge and data center markets. As part of our portfolio simplification, we will move our Edge business into CCG and refocus our NEX portfolio on networking and telco. We will also integrate our software business into our core business units to foster more integrated solutions that address our customers' most difficult challenges. We are evaluating other portfolio actions which we will communicate when appropriate and we plan to provide new segment reporting that reflects these portfolio shifts in Q1 of 2025. Related to our cost and efficiency actions, the restructuring charges we took in Q3 were significant and necessary to right-size the company as we reduced spending by over $10 billion in 2025. There was also a sizable impairment mostly related to Intel 7 equipment and space reflecting excess COVID era spending that we have concluded cannot migrate to more advanced nodes now that we have fully transitioned to EUV processing. From a broader financial perspective, the actions we took in Q3 go a long way towards delivering the 2025 financial commitments we outlined last quarter. Specifically, we plan to reduce non-product cost of sales by $1 billion lower OpEx to $17.5 billion and drive gross and net CapEx to between $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion respectively. We expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive next year and we will focus on decreasing leverage and improving liquidity. Let me go into greater detail on the business starting with Intel Products. We continue to focus on our core x86 franchise and the ecosystems we have developed over 40 plus years of investing. They are a tangible source of value and differentiation for Intel, our partners and our collective customers, and help to cement the x86 architecture as uniquely positioned to meet customer demands going forward. We are taking steps to supercharge and further unlock the value of our x86 franchise. We intend to drive new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future demands of next-generation computing and we see this unlocking a range of meaningful opportunities across all our businesses. I am particularly excited about our recent announcement with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group. We are bringing together leaders from across the ecosystem to help shape the future of x86 with a focus on simplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and interface consistency across vendors and equipment developers with standardized architectural tools and guidelines. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat have signed on as founding members as have industry luminaries, Linus Torvalds and Tim Sweeney. Turning to our product segments, in CCG, we continue to lead the AI PC category. In September at IFA, we launched our Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors formerly named Lunar Lake. This is the most efficient family of x86 processors ever created, setting a new standard for mobile AI performance and significantly out performing competitor platforms. Lunar Lake's combination of superior performance at comparable and competitive battery life positions us well to continue to define and lead the AI PC category. We also continue to nurture the most robust AI PC ecosystem in the industry with more than 100 ISVs, 300 applications and 500 AI models powered by Core Ultra and we remain on track to ship more than a 100 million AI PCs accumulative by the end of 2025. Next up is Arrow Lake, which launched earlier this month and brings the power of the AI PC to the desktop, delivering a huge leap in performance per watt and bringing an NPU to enthusiast desktop and entry workstation platforms for the first time. All of this is paving the way toward the launch of Panther Lake in the second half of 2025. Panther Lake will be our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a more performant and cost competitive process that will allow us to bring more wafers home and improve overall profitability. Overall, we are making good progress in CCG. Our share position is strong with a product roadmap and ecosystem that is increasingly setting us apart from our competition, especially in the enterprise market as customers continue to see increasing value from our vPro solutions. Turning to DCAI, our focus is squarely on delivering powerful AI systems that provide enterprise customers with greater choice and flexibility, optimal performance per watt, and lower total cost of ownership and this quarter's launches significantly enhance our market competitiveness even as we recognize we have more work to do. We launched our latest Xeon 6 product code-named Granite Rapids, which doubles the performance of the prior gen with increased core counts, memory bandwidth and embedded AI acceleration. The new Xeon 6 is tailor-made to handle compute intensive workloads with exceptional efficiency from edge to data center and cloud environments. This solidifies our position as the head node of choice in AI servers. Greater than 70% of [Technical Difficulty] servers are already using Intel Xeon as the host CPU and we have a significant opportunity to build on this as we continue re-establishing Xeon's competitive strength and market leadership. This quarter, we also launched our Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which delivers twice the networking bandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor for large language model efficiency. While the Gaudi 3 benchmarks have been impressive and we are pleased by our recent collaboration with IBM to deploy Gaudi 3 as a service on IBM Cloud. The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use. As a result, we will not achieve our target of 500 million in revenue for Gaudi in 2024. That said, taking a longer term view, we remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is clear need for solutions with superior TCO based on open standards and we are continuing to enhance the Gaudi value proposition. In NEX, we announced last month that we will be focusing the business on networking and telco as part of our efforts to simplify our portfolio, drive productivity, and enhance our market position. We will move our Edge business into CCG, which creates a meaningful opportunity to more efficiently leverage our core client business and extend our leadership to a wide range of vertical edge solutions, especially as AI on the edge accelerates. As a simpler, more focused NEX, we are better positioned to gain profitable share in the most attractive markets. In Networking, we continue to further Open Source Ethernet solutions for connectivity through our Ultra Accelerator Link and Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Let me now turn to Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership through disciplined execution of our roadmap. Intel 18A, our fifth node in four years is healthy and continues to progress well at this stage in the development process. Our lead vehicles for Intel 18A, Panther Lake, and Clearwater Forest have met early 18A milestones ahead of next year's launches. In addition, we have seen good traction with the release of our 1.0 PDK last quarter and the material increase in the engagements and the number of RFQs we are actively quoting. While we will not win them all, we are confident in our head-to-head position based on feedback from potential customers. Most recently, as announced, we are finalizing a multiyear, multibillion dollar commitment by AWS to expand our existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 and the new AI fabric chip on Intel 18A. Beyond AWS, we added two additional 18A wafer design wins this quarter from compute centric companies and our pipeline of potential wafer designs has grown nicely over the quarter. Given our leadership and advanced packaging capabilities, we also added multiple backend design wins this quarter. We were also awarded an additional 3 billion in direct funding under the Secure Enclave program to produce leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. We are proud to be the US government's Partner of Choice to fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure the US maintains its leadership in advanced manufacturing microelectronic systems and process technology. Moving forward, as we shared last month, we are creating clearer separation for Intel Foundry by establishing the business as an independent subsidiary. This is important to our external foundry customers and will give us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products. We are in the process of forming a fiduciary board for the new foundry subsidiary, which will include independent directors with deep semiconductor experience. In our all other category, our number one priority is to unlock shareholder value. For Altera, revenue increased 14% sequentially and operating profit turned positive in Q3. We also announced the introduction of our new mid-range and small form factor products, Agilex 5 and Agilex 3 to serve broad market customers and segments. With an increasingly competitive roadmap, the business is well-positioned to show continued top and bottom line improvements. Consistent with what we have said previously, we remain focused on selling a stake in Altera on a path to its IPO in the coming years. To that end, we have begun discussions with potential investors and expect to conclude in early 2025. For Mobileye, the company continues to be a leader in the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems and by providing Mobileye with separation and autonomy, we have enhanced its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and accelerate its path to creating even greater value. The company recently hosted an AI event laying out a comprehensive strategy for camera-centric compound AI systems providing a full range of autonomous driving solutions. Wrapping up, our Q3 results reflect heightened focus, discipline and execution you can expect moving forward. We are rigorously managing our costs and improving our profitability to create long-term shareholder value. We are carefully managing our cash to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity and we are staying closely connected with customers and partners as we innovate to meet their most challenging needs. Q3 also reflected some very difficult decisions we made to right-size the business and I want to recognize the hard work of our employees. We put some points on the board over the past few months, but we are far from satisfied. We view every quarter as a new opportunity to up our game and continue to execute well and that is our mindset entering Q4. With that, I will now turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thanks, Ross. And obviously this was a good quarter on the progress that we had, three new customers, Amazon, which we were public on a few weeks ago, Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest internally, two new external customers added to that. So solid progress on it. Clearly, next year, there's not a lot of financial benefit from it because we're only ramping late in the year. Thus, we'll be giving more qualitative metrics on progress as we go through the year, Ross. We'll continue to update, give LDV updates, lifetime deal value for foundry updates as we go through the year. Clearly, as we get more customers, we'll be updating on that progress. It has much larger impacts on '26 financials as we ramp and bring wafers home as well as move into the better margin structure that we'll have on Panther Lake with 18A and across the product line. So we'll be giving clarity in that way, but it will be hard to tie it to specific financials next year, but this is super important for us. For our foundry business, for the industry. So we'll be giving plenty of color as we proceed. And I would just add that, as we indicated on our last quarter's earnings call, as we go through this restructuring phase, we're in the next phase of our transformation. With that, we're much more focused on the sustainable business model results, shareholder return, financial disciplines. The first phase is very much about getting back in the game. Getting process in place, getting shell ahead in place, getting our products competitive. So I think overall, Ross, we're going to be much more focused on it. Those are the tough actions we've taken this quarter on getting our cost base where we need to be. And overall, the operating margin, the gross margins of the company, overall cost base, CapEx investment, they're just getting a lot more attention from us as we go forward. Yes. Defect density, it's a complex conversation, Tim, because that big die sizes have lower percent yields, right, even at the same defect density. So it's very variable depending on the particular die size of the product. So when we said the D0 of less than 0.4, that was a healthy yield number at this phase of the process development, that's not yet a high-volume production yield level. But we're not at that phase of the process development yet for 18A. So it's a number that says we are at where we'd want to be at this point in the process development life cycle. Clearly, as you bring it to high-volume production, which we'll be doing in the second half of next year, we have to be markedly lower than that in terms of defect density. But we believe that we see all the signs, the signals, and we're managing this very carefully to accomplish that as we get to next year. Similarly, as we look at today's Intel 3, we're accomplishing the defect densities with the maturity levels that we'd expect on that. But again, yield in the process technology is something you're never done with, right? You hit key milestones on quality yield and then you go into high-volume production and you continue to work on that going forward. I'd also emphasize that the Arizona ramp is important for us as we move to 18A. And that comes online in volume in the second half of next year and that's all on track as well as we have tool move-ins, EUV tools and qualification now, first wafers coming out of the volume fab in Arizona in Q1 of next year. So overall, we're progressing well, and we'll be giving you updates as we proceed. Yes. Thank you. Panther Lake, some tiles would be external, but the majority of the millimeter square in the package are back internal. It's more 70% plus of the silicon area is back in-house. So the majority of Panther Lake wafer capacity by a good margin is coming back inside for Intel. Nova Lake, we definitely have some SKUs that we're looking at continuing to leverage externally, but the large majority of Nova Lake and more of the additional tiles have come back in-house as well. So we still have some flexibility in the Nova Lake product, but the large majority of that is committed to the Intel Product or Intel Foundry. So overall, we are absolutely executing on the bringing wafer's home strategy that we've laid out. That said, TSMC has been a great partner. Clearly, Lunar Lake has demonstrated the strength of the partnership and one that we'll use selectively in our product lines for the future. But a large percentage of wafers coming home that meaningfully fills our factories that also meaningfully improves the margin structure of Intel and Intel Products. Yes. Thank you, C.J. I'll say we have optionality in the product portfolio that way. We have more resilience in our supply chain than competition does as a result. So we feel quite good about that. We continue to really value the relationship, right, with TSMC and our product portfolio is set up very nicely with respect to 18A capacity. Given our shell ahead strategy and the investments that we've made over the last several years, we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if market conditions require for our products, but also if market conditions require for our Foundry customers as well. And given the margin stacking nature that we uniquely are able to benefit from every wafer we bring home adds to the margin structure of Intel in a meaningful way. So we really are setting ourselves up very nicely for the future. And as we make progress on 18A,18AP, 14A, an aggressive road map, advanced packaging, which is uniquely based on Intel technologies and finding more momentum in our product line, but also in our Foundry customers, we really are starting to see the benefits of the long-term strategy that we've put in place with Intel Products with Intel Foundry. Yes. And I'd say, overall, it's hard to say. We have geopolitical factors and other things that the world is looking at and I don't think we have any wisdom beyond that at this point. We're clearly trying to manage the business to a cost structure that we're very comfortable with. But as we indicated by the last question, C.J., we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if necessary or we have the opportunity to do that as well. And overall, there's quite a bit of uncertainty, I think, in the marketplace, so our strategy positions us well to deal with those overall uncertainties that we don't control, but we're very committed to control what we can directly do. Yes. Thank you, Vivek. Maybe three different perspectives just to highlight. Number one is the CPU plays an increasing role in data center AI compute. Even in cloud-based environments today, head nodes are an area of strength for Intel Xeon already, as I reflected in my comments. As you go into enterprise AI, we expect to place a more prominent role, databases, embedding, refinement or much more attuned to CPU workloads. And our strategy there is CPU plus accelerator or CPU plus Gaudi. So we see the enterprise use cases having a very long life associated with them going forward. Second, as I said, Gaudi 3, good product and seeing good early interest from customers. We mentioned the IBM win, but a good pipeline of activities there. So Xeon plus accelerator in that regard. And as we launched this quarter, we also have the x86 Ecosystem Advisory. We are breathing life into the x86 architecture and we're seeing extraordinary interest from the industry, from luminaries and how we build on that momentum. So we definitely want to be very front footed with x86 for a full range of use cases, but also the AI use cases as well and the industry is quite interested in joining us participating and expanding the world's greatest architecture of all time. The most industry influence, the broadest number of ISVs and applications and continuing that momentum forward. Yes. So overall the external Foundry business will be a modest portion, right, of the Foundry business for the next couple of years. The Foundry revenues will be dominated by the internal products as we've been building that portfolio for many years. So we'll ramp as we go through the rest of the decade. We said our financial objectives by the end of the decade are $15 billion plus of external Foundry revenue. We'll be giving periodic updates on LDV, lifetime deal value of external Foundry customers as we go forward. And indicators like we did this quarter of new design wins, new customers coming online. But the reported numbers for Intel Foundry will be substantially dominated by the Intel Products for the next couple of years. That said, we saw a nice growth, right, quarter-on-quarter in the external Foundry business and we did break profitable for the advanced packaging portion of that business in Q3. So we are seeing nice growth characteristics, nice business characteristics, and we'll be giving more updates as we go forward. Dave, anything to add on that? Yes. Thank you, Aaron. And I'd say our goal is stabilize our position and grow from that position. And this was a solid quarter for our execution. Clearly, Xeon 6, Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest now fully shipping and available are important milestones. Obviously, the AWS deal was a very nice deal because it reinforces Xeon, but also our expanding role of customization. So I'll say the first order of business is hold share and then regain share. The strength that we've seen for Xeon is this AI head nodes, these AI use cases. We have very good performance on Granite Rapids for AI use cases. And as we look to the future, getting just more competitive on basic power performance per core and fighting for share there is clearly the initiatives that we have underway. Clearwater Forest powered on, right, showing health of 18A, Diamond Rapids will shortly go into fab. So the roadmap is in good solid shape as well. So I'd say, overall, we feel that is a good pathway. And if I add to the last question as well for AI, I'd also emphasize that all of the energy has been in training. And all of us all of that associated with cloud-based training. But training is creating the weather model, not using it. And increasingly, I think, every analyst is putting more and more attention to how do we use those models? How do we inferencing against them? How do we retrain for our localized data? How do we complement that with RAG and database embeddings and all of those are areas that are much more CPU-centric. So the strength of our CPU and its unique power in some of these AI use cases as well as something we see the market coming more toward us and the strength that we've traditionally had. Well, I'd say we do see significant interest in this area and moving your supply chains, though, is complicated and takes qualification time and many of these designs were first designed on CoWAS, and now they're looking at Foveros, and then they're looking at the unique technologies that we have like EMIB as well. So we actually see very good momentum in that area. Now those aren't as revenue-producing as wafer design, so they're not nearly, right, as large in size, but the pipeline of activities is very strong. And the quarter-on-quarter improvements we saw were largely driven by advanced packaging. Most of the external revenue that we'll see, which will be nicely up year-on-year as we go into '25 in the external Foundry will be advanced packaging and we also see healthy margins for that technology as well. So moving supply chain is always hard and slow, but the progress that we've seen already the design wins that we already include in our LDV and then the pipeline of additional designs that we are engaging in, all of us give us great optimism that this becomes a foundational piece of our Foundry business for the long-term. And as I noted in an earlier comment, we did see our advanced packaging now as a profitable business, a standalone by itself as well. Yes. And maybe architecturally, the second half of that question, Lunar Lake was initially designed to be a niche product that we wanted to achieve highest performance and great battery life, capability, and then AI PC occurred. And with AI PC, it went from being a niche product to a pretty high-volume product. Now relatively speaking, we're not talking about 50 million, 100 million units, but a meaningful portion of our total mix from a relatively small piece of it as well. So as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AI PC category. That's at a volume product and a volume industry like the PC industry, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business. So it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off package in the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off package in the roadmap going forward. And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure specifically around Lunar Lake. But again it's a great product. And we're happy that we have it in the portfolio and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AI PC category. Chris, the thing I would, just to add a little bit to that, Chris, would be that now that we've gotten an EUV fleet, right, into our CapEx base, we have a lot more flexibility across that fleet. Largely, the CapEx used for Intel 3, 18A and 14A highly leveraged across it. So we're much more building to overall capacity requirements and not this very rapid 5 nodes, 4 years, get back to a modern fleet of capability. Obviously, the other point to add to that is now that we have finished this 5 nodes, 4 years, we're progressing to a more normal cadence of new technologies as opposed to this racing through capital. So that will also give us additional flexibility. And I'll say largely with the singular exception of high NA, EUV, the equipment bases are almost entirely the same across the 14A node as well. And even at high NA, we've built flexibility into the TD development that we have optionality to include or not include that as a central part of it. So we've built a lot of capacity. Now we're going to leverage that capacity in much more efficient ways for both a overall high-volume manufacturing and a TD leverage going forward. Yes. And I'll just say, we're very comfortable that moving to the subsidiary model as we outlined in the last earnings call, it gives us, I'll say, three things that we're aiming for greater operational rate integrity, right, as we create that clear separation, the opportunity to be able to communicate that more clearly and definitively to our external customers and then the potential to fund and manage the capital requirements of Foundry. That said, the vast majority of volumes through the decade come from Intel Products. The synergies of that co-development and customer zero aspect is very substantial as we see it. And the benefits that we get from the overall cash flows and managing the balance sheet of the company as we go forward are highly beneficial as well. So for all those reasons, our simple view is distinct but Better Together. Yes. And there's a lot of details behind it, Joe, but I'll just maybe give a couple of quick examples. We, for instance, create complexity in the server product line E-Cores, P-Cores across different socket types that complexity was maybe appropriate when the business was substantially larger and growing. At its current size, it puts too much complexity on our development as well as our customers and OEM, how many SKUs they're developing. So we've taken steps to simplify the product line, have fewer SKUs to cover the marketplace, and we're focused on the efficiencies associated with that. Similarly, in the client product area, simplifying the roadmap, fewer SKUs to cover it. How are we handling graphics and how that is increasingly becoming a large integrated graphics capabilities. So less need for discrete graphics in the market going forward. So simplifying the roadmap in those areas. And then the steps we took around our CCG and Edge business to be able to bring that together for better reach to the market, leveraging our core investments. So a variety of those, but many others behind that as we get ourselves, I'll say, in fighting shape that allows us to leverage our investments, hit our $17.5 billion OpEx that Dave spoke about and still have a very solid growth in a more profitable way for the future. Yes. And clearly external Foundry, right, requires a different view of how you run and manage that business, but the wafers, the cash flows come from the internal business. So this subsidiary model is a key piece of how we're going to drive that cultural transformation, but still bring the success of an at-scale leading-edge, western-centered Foundry model. That is an extraordinary asset for us, for the industry and for the world. So we're very focused on making that successful. This has been an extraordinary journey to accomplish 5 nodes in 4 years and bring us from years behind to a leadership position in technology. And wow, it's just stunning to see what our TD teams have been able to accomplish there, but we're not done. We have a lot of work in front of us yet. We're well on our way to completing what will be one of the most seminal restructuring in the history, the steps that we took in our financial restructuring this quarter was very critical to be able to bring us to a point that we can say we have the capacity to and driving to long-term shareholder return. So maybe just as we wrap up, thank you, as always for joining the call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress, the actions we've taken. Q3 was a good step. Now we need to finish the year strong and prepare for 2025. We're determined to get it right and I look forward to the updates along the way. Thank you and look forward to speaking to you all again soon."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $13.3 billion up 4% sequentially and in the upper half of the range we provided in August. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered sequential revenue growth, even as we navigated an inventory drawdown in client. Turning to non-GAAP gross margin, as you know, last quarter, we guided gross margins of 38%, but indicated that we expected incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan and some of those costs would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin. We recognized approximately $3 billion of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges, primarily for Intel 7, which are above and beyond our quarter-to-quarter asset adjustments, driving our non-GAAP gross margin down to 18% and EPS to a loss of $0.46. This $3 billion charge reduced non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 2,300 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.61 per share. Beyond those impairment charges, we also were impacted by $15.6 billion of charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. These charges have three main components. First, we impaired our deferred tax asset balance by nearly $10 billion which was triggered by cumulative GAAP based losses over the last three years. Second, a $2.6 billion goodwill impairment related to Mobileye, which shows up in our consolidated earnings. And lastly is $2.2 billion associated with the severance of approximately 15% of our employees, aligned with our plan to reduce operating expenses to $17.5 billion and take out $1 billion of other cost of sales next year. This last charge is the only charge with a cash impact. The tax asset impairment charge will not affect cash taxes going forward and full details are in the 10-Q, which will be available tomorrow. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.1 billion up approximately $1.8 billion sequentially on better working capital. We had growth CapEx of $6.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion. We expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring charges to land in Q4 2024. We have $24.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, paid down $2.8 billion of debt in the quarter and remain focused on delevering next year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results, Intel Products revenue was $12.2 billion up 3% sequentially. CCG revenue was down 1% quarter-over-quarter as customers worked down their inventory as expected. DCAI revenue was up 10% sequentially, as demand for traditional servers improved. Revenue for NEX was up double-digit sequentially, as elements of this business start to recover off a cyclical bottom. Q3 operating profit for Intel Products was $3.3 billion, 27% of revenue and up $400 million quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Operating income was negatively impacted by a $300 million write-down of accelerator inventory due to reduced revenue expectations. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion up slightly sequentially, driven by increased wafer mix of Intel 4, 3. Foundry operating loss of $5.8 billion was down sequentially materially driven by the $3 billion impairment charges I discussed earlier. We expect losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q4, minus this impairment charge. Next year, as we move to nodes with a better cost structure and realize the savings associated with the restructuring actions, we expect operating losses to improve significantly. Additionally, we are intensely focused on driving improved returns on our roughly $80 billion of tangible book value, most of which is associated with Intel Foundry. Mobileye reported revenue of $485 million and maintained full year guidance for revenue and adjusted operating income. Q3 revenue was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by a more than 50% reduction in shipments to China, where comparisons will become easier as the exposure is now significantly smaller. Cash generation was quite strong, as operating cash flow was well above operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $412 million up 14% sequentially, consistent with guidance to support improved lead times by our distribution partners. Operating margins increased sequentially by 900 basis points on better gross margins and spending discipline. For Q4, we expect high-single-digit sequential revenue growth, as we work with our distribution partners to prepare for the cutover to Altera independent warehouse operations. Overall, billings remain below consumption, as end customers continue to work down inventory tied to previous supply constraints. We anticipate inventory normalization will continue through the first half of next year. Now turning to our Q4 guidance. We successfully worked down client customer inventory levels in Q3, in line with our expectations and despite continued client customer inventory reductions in Q4, CCG should grow towards the higher end of seasonal, often abnormal Q3. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially across DCAI and NEX businesses in aggregate. Based on these factors, we expect revenue of $13.3 million to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of $13.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 39.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.12, all on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, as we continue to execute on our cost actions and portfolio decisions, we expect additional restructuring charges in Q4. We continue to size the business to support trend line revenue growth of 3% to 5% annually with the ability to scale up to 7% to 9% as demand dictates. We anticipate that our 2024 gross and net capital investments will be approximately $25 billion and $11 billion respectively. Our expectation is for adjusted free cash flow to be negative in 2024 due to the restructuring charges disclosed today and the uncertainty around the timing of capital offsets as we approach year-end. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and gross and net CapEx of $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion, respectively, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. Before I close, let me take a moment to remind you of a couple of items as you model 2025 and that today's restructuring and impairment charges are in service to achieve this financial model. First, we are positive on the growing market adoption of the AI PC and our strong product positioning. As our mix of outsourced products and CCG grows in calendar year 2025 and we ramp Intel 18A to support Panther Lake, gross margin expansion could be muted, particularly in the second half. We expect gross margin fall-through to significantly improve in 2026 driven by the vastly improved cost structure of Intel 18A, the return of tiles to a meaningfully underutilized Intel Foundry and operational efficiencies. Second, the estimated $700 million on a GAAP basis of noncontrolled income from Mobileye, Altera, IMS and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners is expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of 2025 and will continue to grow in future years with the ramping of wafer outs at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland. In closing, our profitability remains well below the standards we've set and recognize there's much more work to be done to improve the efficiency of the business. We're encouraged by the progress we made this quarter to rightsize the spending, and our process and product execution, combined with a strong external customer traction in the quarter, give us confidence our strategy will deliver compelling shareholder returns. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A. Yes. Good question. Okay. So I would say the third quarter surprise was really associated with better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. I think that was the thing that upsided us the most in the third quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we'll have that better sell-through won't repeat itself. So that will be a fundamental driver of why the gross margins kind of slipped down absent the impairment charge. And additionally, we're going to have more start-up costs in the fourth quarter associated with 18A than we did in the third quarter. So that's going to put a little pressure on the gross margins. But I do think the 39.5% guide at the midpoint for the fourth quarter is a pretty clean guide. It has less kind of noise around it than some of the previous quarters. So I think it's a good kind of metric to kind of start to inform how '25 will look in terms of gross margins. We're not going to provide guidance yet on '25. It's still early. I would say the puts and takes of it are, for sure, as Pat indicated, we're all in on AI PC and in particular, we're all in on Lunar Lake, which is our next-generation product. As you know, Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, that affects the gross margins, and I think it's going to weigh down the gross margins on the product side of the business for us in '25. Now as you know, Panther Lake is the next one, the margins get better just at the product level, but they also include more mix of wafers internally, which also helps the foundry business. So as we get more volume ramping in '26 and Panther Lake, that's going to be helpful for gross margins. On the Foundry side, we will see improvement next year. You won't see it because we don't report it at that level, but we will see gross margin improvement on the Foundry side as we step into '25, partly because of the reductions we talked about. As we talked about, we're going to reduce our spending by more than $10 billion, $1 billion of it is directly in cost of sales associated with the Intel Foundry business getting more efficient in terms of their spend. Additionally, we're just going to be mixing more to EUV wafers. EUV wafers have a better pricing dynamic, they have a better cost structure on a relative basis. So we see improvement there. And I've been pleased with just the new model of managing the Foundry business with a P&L. I've seen all kinds of better decision-making going on, both at Foundry and at the Product side just to optimize their cost structure in a better way, and that should help as well. Longer term, I just think as we continually improve our product portfolio, both in Foundry and Products, that usually commands a better margin profile and also longer term be a tailwind. But not yet, I think, something that shows up meaningfully in '25. Yes. So we're not going to provide, C.J., guidance for Q1. Let's work on Q4, and we can update you in January. But the average seasonality for Q1 is in the 8% to 10% range and we'll give you more color as we get into next quarter's earnings, whether we are going to be seasonal or see things differently than that. Yes. So on revenue growth, again, we're not going to, for 2025, I'd say just that we are managing the business in terms of how we're investing in the business to a 3% to 5% growth rate next year, but over time, in our minds. And things turn out to be better, then that's good fall through to us from a profitability perspective. I wasn't suggesting that you take the 39.5%, you move it every quarter. Clearly, every quarter is going to have some unique aspects to it. Only that 39.5% was a quarter in which it was clean and it was a good proxy to start the calculation for the full year of '25. You're right, yes, we do see more headwind in the second half versus the first half given Lunar Lake becoming a more meaningful part of the volume over time for 2025. Again, that starts to improve in the following year as Panther Lake becomes more and more meaningful part of the volume for the client business in 2026. No, I mean, other than it was up a bit this quarter, but still dominated by internal business within the Intel Foundry business. Yes. And just to be clear, it's exclusive to Lunar Lake, but not Meteor Lake. And it's having a pretty meaningful impact, a significant impact on Lunar Lake's gross margins, and originally we were like a third of the volume in terms of our expectations next year on Lunar Lake when we recognized how important the AI PC market would be and how good this part was competitively. We pushed the volume significantly up. And so that has put some reasonable pressure on the gross margins for the total company. Yes. I think on the $17.5 billion for OpEx, that's a pretty firm plan. I mean, obviously, we can make some adjustments here or there, if necessary. But we think we've rightsized the investments to invest in the most important areas that Pat and the team want to pursue. And so that, I would say, is relatively firm. Maybe there's just a little bit of variability there that we can make adjustments as we kind of progress through the year. The CapEx, there are three components to CapEx. There is what we're going to invest for the process, advancing the process. There's investment associated with this shell ahead and there's investments associated with capacity. We're always going to make those investments to advance the process. That will always be the case. Shell ahead, we will, but we have largely caught up, I think. And so now we're going to be more measured, I think, as we look to increasing our shell capacity. And then capacity itself then becomes the flex, the tooling out of shells, and we're kind of modulating that based on what we see in terms of demand and, of course, managing it relative to cash flow. So there obviously is flexibility there as we progress through the year and into the following year. And our goal is to generate free cash flow to generate adjusted free cash flow next year and there and onwards. So we'll be managing net CapEx accordingly. I guess the one other variable to the net CapEx would be any of the offsets. And of course we're aggressively pursuing offsets, some of which we know will already show up next year. SCIP will be a component of our offsets next year. We're also going to start to see some more meaningful impact from the investment tax credit next year, which we have already baked into the forecast."

With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process roadmaps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations due in part by our decision to more quickly ramp core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments. We previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AI PC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate and extend our leadership and drive significant benefits in the years to come. Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in second half of 2025. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performant and cost-competitive process, which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in-house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost-reduction plan we announced today. This plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model, which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. Having separate financial reporting for Intel Products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company. It also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources, taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and headcount beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a headcount reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025 with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family. These are hard, but necessary decisions. Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx targeted at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates. We expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy. Our new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 billion and $27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. Combined with strong execution of our smart capital strategy, including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion to $14 billion. Increased capital efficiency has a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly $1 billion of savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. We designed our smart capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trend line growth, while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost-effectively capture upside when it comes. We are taking the added step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. We reiterate our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels. Reductions across OpEx, CapEx, and cost of sales total well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long-term strategy. We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera, and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter-on-quarter. With improved client inventory levels exiting Q3, we see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range. Let me now provide more details by our key business units, starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive five-nodes-in-four-years march and the finish line is officially within sight. We are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3, and Intel 20A is been ready for production next quarter. On Intel 18A, we released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year with production wafer start volumes in first half of 2025. Panther Lake for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use RibbonFet, PowerVia, and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. Clearwater Forest for server, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities is booted and likewise looking very healthy. These are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market. Importantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in four years, completing an historic pace of design and process innovation and returning Intel to process leadership. Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started and once we do, it will unlock further growth and value creation across our Foundry and Product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading-edge capacity continues to weigh on near-term profitability, but long term, they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024 and then driving to breakeven. To help accelerate [Technical Difficulty] our Foundry Services business, Kevin has led large foundry and fabless businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running [Technical Difficulty] considerable time with current and future Foundry customers as we ramp our process packaging and chipset capabilities for the AI era. We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our Foundry Manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. Overall, our Foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners. In Q2, Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge advanced packaging technology. EMIB makes it possible to cost-effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well underway on Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation on our process roadmap, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D and capital spending requirements. Let's now turn to Intel Products. In our largest and most profitable business, CCG, we continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our roadmap. The AI PC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience and Intel is at the forefront of this category creating moment. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AI PCs since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year end, and over 100 million accumulative by the end of 2025. Lunar Lake, our next-generation AI PC, which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July, will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh. Lunar Lake delivers superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3 times more tops Gen-on-Gen with our enhanced NPU and will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs, which will begin to ship this quarter. Lunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake, which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong roadmap over the next 18 months. Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation of which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeon powering data centers around the world today, and our roadmap is designed to build upon this vast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible, and scalable and reduce total cost of ownership for customers. We took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-core processors, formerly codenamed Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high-density to scale our workloads. It drives performance up, power down, and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-Core, codenamed Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and will begin shipping this quarter. Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product featuring our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power-on and is on track to launch in 2025. As we've reestablished Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in AI servers. We are also focused on improving our accelerator roadmap. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility, and value that is very compelling to customers, particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable, cost-effective Gen AI solutions. Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks, and reference designs combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or Open Platform for Enterprise AI, are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level, at just two-thirds the cost of competitive offerings. To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2 times performance per dollar in both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support, including Dell Technologies, Hewert-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, Gigabyte, Inventec, Quanta Cloud Technology, and Wistron. Turning to NEX, we continue to see stability in Q2, while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI Network Interface Card and Foundry Chiplets, which we'll launch next year. Our recent IPU adapter for the enterprise supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat broadens access to the solution co-developed with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low latency communication for scale up AI systems, communication, and data centers. Combined with the growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well-positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate focus and resources to realize their growth opportunities and execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders, similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye two years ago and IMS last year. Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying, it has been a hard fought first half of the year. We have achieved several important milestones and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus and renewed intensity to up our gain and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. With that, I'll pass it over to Dave.\nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1 point year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction, which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth, offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses. Profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations with Q2 gross margin of 38.7% and EPS of $0.02. Weaker than expected gross margin was due to three main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AI PC product. In addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 Core Ultra shipments, we made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and Intel 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and Intel 3 gross margin long-term as we scale up the Ireland fab. Margins were also impacted by higher than typical period charges related to non-core businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital. Gross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion. Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year. The client business grew 9% year-over-year as the AI PC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs, partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter. DCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down 3 points year-over-year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat both sequentially and year-over-year, so excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market, NEX delivered 10% year-over-year growth in the first half. Q2 operating profit for Intel Products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue and up approximately $400 million year-over-year, on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes, Intel 4 and Intel 3. Foundry Services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base, including the start of advanced packaging revenue. Foundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3 with more than 85% of wafer volumes still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power performance and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and Intel 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and start-up costs to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability. Mobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to non-recurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion, and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many Western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half. Altera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double-digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns. Now turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year, along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3 with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets. With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter. We expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes. While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability, a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AI PC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the third quarter. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03, all on a non-GAAP basis. As Pat discussed earlier, lower than anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response. These actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently. Additionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 billion to $27 billion with a net capital spending of $11 billion to $13 billion, including our SCIP programs. These adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges necessary to achieve our spending targets. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 billion to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization, and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage. Before I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple of items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from Street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within non-variable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion. While that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall-through for gross margin next year. The AI PC is a big winner for the company and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We therefore intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the product is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year. The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on 18A and has a much improved cost structure. As the momentum of AI PCs drives Panther Lake demand, together with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion in subsequent years. Lastly, the non-controlled income from Mobileye, Altera, and IMF and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners show up on a line below net income called non-controlling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years. In closing, the market has not recovered as expected and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting 2025 spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions, while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results, leveraging our new operating model. We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies, and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model of 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller?\nOperator: Certainly, our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Pat, big picture, are the challenges the product issue, market issue, strategic issue, execution issue, I'm just wondering has the core issues been accurately diagnosed, because when we look at your CPU competitor, they appear to be doing much better in this same environment. So I'm curious what is plan B if just cost cuts don't do the job?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Vivek. I'll start out, would say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration, and rebuilding plan is now well underway. With 18A, PDK 1.0, with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered-on, our geo footprint now starting to take shape, we have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on Phase 2, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace and we're just now getting to competitiveness. But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long-term journey. I'd say this rebuilding that we're underway, this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors four decades ago. We firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building two world-class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise as we could describe it, is building a world-class Intel Foundry and building a world-class Intel Products Group. These efforts we believe have identified many opportunities for us to have financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today, and we believe that with the new products, a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation that we see the long-term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders.\nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up?\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. For my follow-up, I'm curious, what impact do the restrictions -- sorry, the restructuring actions have on either your R&D roadmap, your long-term external foundry opportunity, and any CHIPS Act funding? I think in the past you had suggested about $15 billion in long-term value from external foundry, is there any impact on those growth targets because of the restructuring action? Just what changes with these restructuring actions? Thank you.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally, we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The CHIPS grants -- taking your questions sort of one-by-one, on the CHIP side, these are milestone-based investments. We still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the CHIPS model that we've put in place, we've worked closely with the CHIPS program office in the U.S. government, we're very comfortable on those plans. Also, the foundry, we are seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities. So the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to. Obviously, with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving just like a world-class foundry does to be much more efficient with our capital investments and scrutinizing them more carefully. And now that we've paid the capital to catch up, and I'll view -- this catch-up capital, we had no spare capacity, we had no site ahead, show ahead. We had no capacity to catch up. As those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well as the foundry commitments that we have in place. Finally, I'll just say, again, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments up and down appropriately, and we've now established a model with our smart capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we said for our strategy on track and we're now moving into Phase 2 of the execution of that strategy.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kind of want to follow-up on the first two, and Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro reality, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera, but it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, the long-term $100 billion target that you just saw weren't happening and therefore felt these cuts were necessary, so do any of the structural changes -- or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world-class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world-class foundries and that's what Intel Foundry is going to become, and that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively, and every aspect of that business is being analyzed and how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots and everything like that so clean sheet analysis. Similarly, on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world-class fabulous company look like. And we uncover quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build-in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world-class Fabless company, and these are significant structural steps. We also realized that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency. We were built for leadership. And now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the four business areas, client, networking, and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future, and similarly, the portfolio of our Intel Foundry business and that's the work that we've now been undertaking and we're now accelerating based on the less than expected quarterly results, we're accelerating those impacts. We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near-term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. We believe the long-term guidance that we've given you, the 60:40, getting to the Foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've said, those are larger portions of our business. We believe those are long-term still achievable in that regard and we're on track for many of those things in the models that we're laying out and today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those.\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?\nRoss Seymore: Yes, I do. Dave, you went through with the good details of the cost structure and what would change the puts and takes for next year. I wondered -- I know you're not going to guide to 2025 revenue, but the puts and takes from maybe a competitive positioning point-of-view, how you're feeling in CCG, DCAI, primarily relative to the competition, any sort of tailwind, headwind analysis or description for 2025 would be helpful.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, sure. On the client side, obviously, we feel very good given our AI PC position, we're leading that new product category. And I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake and the performance of that, so that looks like a phenomenally good product and position. We're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center and that's only going to grow as we go into next year. The big question is when does the kind of traditional CPU market recover? It has been tempered this year, and of course, affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. That's obviously been a soft space and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then NEX, obviously also outside of the telco space is starting to recover. And then we have these other businesses, Altera is starting to recover now. So we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them and we'll have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately. I think on the margin front, I talked about our kind of tempered view of gross margins next year, given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which with memory and package and almost all of the material getting sourced outside and they're seeing -- we're seeing inflation in that space that is impacting it. But that part is followed by Panther Lake, that comes back into the fab. And I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of the capacity that we had to move into the external sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of -- in terms of profitability. And then, of course, we've done a lot, as Pat talked about in terms of restructuring the business and those will start to show up next year, but will be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out, both in the kind of medium term and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And if we do get the growth, it puts us in an even better position.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\nCJ Muse: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, a follow-up to that prior question. I was hoping you could perhaps speak to how to think about gross margins beyond 2025. It's obviously very hard to offer the leverage when you're investing in both foundry capacity and at the same time outsourcing meaningful tiles to TSM. So encouraging that you're bringing Panther Lake back in-house. How should we think about incremental margins there? And any of the other kind of moving parts that you've been speaking about on this call, including the unfavorable product mix and the more competitive pricing. Is that just a near-term kind of phenomenon or something else we should be thinking about into 2025, 2026?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So as I talked about to Ross, CJ, the good news for 2026 for us is that, that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles and so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of less of a headwind for us, so that will also be helpful. And then like I said, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way, both from the actions we've taken today, but the new operating model and decisions will get made on a go-forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward. I think 2026 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out. I think from a mix perspective, it's probably not going to be a big headwind or tailwind for us, just strict mix other than as we move towards more leading-edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will -- that will be one factor that will certainly help us. It also -- in that regard, that also helps us on the pricing side because, obviously, from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers. And then ultimately, I think on pricing, it will really come down to when we have a competitive process and we have competitive products running on a competitive process and we're delivering what the customers want, that helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic. And we're getting to the place as Pat talked about where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through the next few years.\nPatrick Gelsinger: And just one thing to add on top of that, just to clarify, with Panther Lake already powered on, right, and showing good health, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year, right? So we'll start to see some of those benefits, but obviously, the huge volume benefits of that really are in 2026, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process with a more competitive product with Panther Lake, offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring Tiles home with a more competitive product and a more competitive process, and that really is, I'll say, the story that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year.\nJohn Pitzer: CJ, do you have a quick follow-up?\nCJ Muse: Yes. Just a quick one on OpEx. You gave us the $17.5 billion for all of calendar 2025, but could you share with us what you think the exit rate would look like? I'm coming to around $4.25 billion, is that in the ballpark?\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I'll say, given that some of the actions we're taking will kind of go through at least the early part of next year, we're going to enter at a higher number than we're going to exit, I'll give you that. And we should be down in 2026 relative to 2025. Give me some time as we progress through the year to start to fine-tune the budget for 2026 and I'll give you more clarity around that.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, C.J. And Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked about the server roadmap with Sierra Forest shipping and Granite Rapids shipping this quarter, can you talk about how that -- where that puts you competitively? Do you think you're kind of have closed the gap or is it leadership product, and obviously, Clearwater for us is the longer-term focus, but where are we in the interim?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And obviously, Sierra Forest, right, E-core product, very efficient, but a new category for us, so we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback, very positive. As we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it, but it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the peak core, I'll say, the more traditional Xeon for us and we'll start that ramp this quarter. But we'll take as anything in the server market, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer-term cycle for that. But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids, even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI build-out, as you know. So in this environment, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint. So we're having to fight to win those socket back, but Granite Rapids looks very positive. The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design, 8A, this level of health, this are early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-Core version of that on 18A is also showing very good -- not in fab yet, but showing a very good design progress. So we feel like the roadmap gets more competitive, and with it, we believe our market share position is fairly, I'll say, static, right? So year-on-year, we do see that overall the arm market share is more modest in the second half this year, so the X86 share, and we're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen for our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged and we're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, including ours. So a lot of things to unpack there, but we do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products and the roadmap only improves from here.\nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up?\nJoseph Moore: Yes. Just on the notion that AI has kind of stolen some of the focus from server, it seems like we would be looking at a ceiling in overall power budgets in a couple of years that would mean we need to invest in traditional server ecosystems and maybe do a significant refresh. Do you see any indications of that and given that -- I perceive you guys are sort of stronger in enterprise than in cloud right now, like how are you positioned to take advantage of that when it does come?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Joe. And we do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us and we do have some early indications of a positive cycle there, but I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications, but we are starting to see, I'll say, better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. Similarly, for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place. The TCO benefits of a server refresh now as we start talking about 3X, 4X consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional, right, cloud environments, their container delivery environments, these are quite substantial. So we do believe that as our products get to be more competitive, right, and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, that the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course, the story is CPU plus GPU, right, and that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously, as Gaudi 3 starts shipping the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA, that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building toward.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Sure, thanks. Dave, can you again explain how June gross margin was so much worse than you thought just three months ago? I mean, revenue is basically in line. I know you talked about mix, but it seems like it was probably a pretty small part of it mix was and it was really more the decisions around Intel 4 and Intel 3. So can you just explain again, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I understand why that was such a big.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Okay. That was the biggest one. Let me -- I'll just say that there were a couple of other things that we had to do some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower that did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake, Intel 3, and even run production on Intel 4 -- sorry, Intel 4, and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab. We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice essentially. And it starts to mature the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes in Ireland more quickly. The downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now. And so we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system and that puts pressure on the margins. That's going to carry into next quarter. I mean, we will do better in next quarter, obviously, but we're going to do more volume and the margins will be below the corporate average because of -- because while we're improving the wafer cost, it's not -- still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. And so it will weigh down on margins for the third quarter as well. After that, we start -- it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better and the situation on Meteor Lake will improve meaningfully.\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a quick follow-up?\nTimothy Arcuri: Yes. Pat, can you just talk about the foundry strategy given the CapEx cut? I guess my question is how you sort of execute on the plan with this lower CapEx. I mean kind of on one hand, you keep -- we keep talking about bringing all these wafers back in-house to help gross margin in 2026. But I also hear about a lot more outsourcing to TSMC even in real-time so, is the cut more that some of your foundry customers are maybe structurally deciding that they're not as committed? I'm just trying to understand how you can kind of CapEx and still execute on this strategy. Thanks.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And at the highest level, the Foundry strategy unchanged. And we've built capacity corridor for Foundry customers. However, until we have committed orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shells and the sites that we have in place. And how much of that corridor we keep available, how much flexibility working with our equipment suppliers that we need for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. We've also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecast. So all of those are, say, are adjustments. The big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build-out, right, and as you think about what we had to catch up, we had no EUV capacity. We had no shell ahead, side ahead capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home. As those come into place, we've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years, and now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in 2024, 2025, and 2026. So we're putting much more aggressive view of capital utilization, right? How much capital require ahead of working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars, just like a foundry does? And for that, we'll point you back to again, right, we're going to be a world-class fabless company. Intel Products, we're going to be a world-class Foundry with Intel Foundry. The last point I'd make here on this is a lot of the early success that we're having with foundry customers is advanced packaging. And there, the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there. Customers in advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity, but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have as, and we've described before, as the on-ramp for Intel Foundry and that's continuing to look very good. The final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, right, to the first order, the Intel product requirements. And clearly, there's a lot of tiles externally in 2025, we bring those home in 2026, that's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, see the benefits of the model that we've put in place. Tiles coming home, leadership process technology, leadership products starts in 2025, deliver big-time in 2026 and beyond.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, do we have the next caller, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. Dave, on the move from Oregon to Ireland fab, you talked about that being a gross margin headwind. Can you talk about how much -- can you clarify how much of a headwind that is right now? And also when it's fully-loaded on a like-for-like basis, how much of a headwind do you think that's going to be on an ongoing basis?\nDavid Zinsner: I'm sorry, the second question is how much will the headwind be on...\nJohn Pitzer: On ongoing basis.\nDavid Zinsner: On an ongoing basis is what you're saying?\nSrini Pajjuri: Ongoing basis? Yeah.\nDavid Zinsner: Okay. All right. So I think the best way to think about it is, we were -- I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin taking into account revenue was part of it. It was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-offs related to legacy businesses and the mix and underutilization also affected and it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. And that will be the case in the third quarter probably given the increase. I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter. Beyond that, it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's actually not going to be a headwind.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, it becomes a tailwind.\nDavid Zinsner: Yes, exactly.\nPatrick Gelsinger: As the Ireland factory ramps, a production factory will have a lower-cost per wafer start than a TV factory like Oregon. So it becomes a headwind as we go into next year.\nDavid Zinsner: Tailwind as we go into... Now as we -- now the challenge for next year will be, we'll now be ramping Lunar Lake next year. Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, so we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins. And additionally, it's got more of the content sourced externally, and as you know, we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of the -- Meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel Products margins, which is why we're tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel Foundry side. It's going to be tempered on the product side and it's really going to be because of Lunar Lake.\nPatrick Gelsinger: And I was just going to add one thing, as we move the Intel 4, Intel 3 capacity into Ireland, it also gives our TD team more focus on their capital on 18A as well as then 14A and 10A, and we're taking, for instance, the second high NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A. So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AI PC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision and optimizing the use of our TD resources for the next-generation technologies, which are already well underway and showing good early indicators.\nJohn Pitzer: Srini, do you have a quick follow-on?\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes. So, Pat, I think in the past, you talked about the foundry business potentially breaking even sometime 2027, and given all the cuts -- and you seem to at least sound confident that foundry opportunity is not changing, so I'm just curious, do you see a possibility that Foundry business could actually breakeven sooner given all the cuts?\nPatrick Gelsinger: Clearly, that's our objective for Dave and I. You all say that said, we have a lot of wood to chop until we complete that journey. The steps that we've taken today are significant, right, ones for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly that's our operating objective that we have. But as we said, 2026 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, the new process technologies. So I'd say that 2027 timeframe is still a good one, but you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability. And the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus, right, will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel Foundry, $10 billion next year is a big number and we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry-forward in 2026. Dave said, an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive, so everything that we're doing is aligned with our thought, Srini.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Srini. Jonathan, we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you, guys. I guess my first question is on the client space. I think, Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double-digits or I think they mentioned above seasonal, however, you quantify seasonal now. Maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of maybe noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market, I think that impact would be more modest relative to what you described. But if you could kind of give us puts and takes there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for since September. Thanks.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. I'll take that Matt. We feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AI PC. Here we have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell-in and sell-through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels, where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given some inventory sell-through in the third quarter above seasonal in Q4. Overall, the TAM expansion is low-single-digit, even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AI PC and further TAM expansion as we go into 2025 as expected now broadly. We'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our vPro assets and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. We also saw things like vPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike Blue Screen period and customers who are vPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on vPro took weeks to recover from that. So a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem, the leadership that we have on AI PC. And as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So I think we're very comfortable and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes.\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-on?\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes, I do. Thanks, John. I wanted to ask -- I think in some of the prepared script and maybe early in the Q&A, Pat, you kind of reiterated the $15 billion funnel for the Foundry business, and I know in the medium term, a lot of that is packaging, but I wanted to ask about the customers that you've engaged with on 18A and maybe early on 14A, how have you seen the charts of the programs that they're planning to bring into your foundry progress in the last few quarters. Are people still committed to ramping those things? Are they taking PDKs and maybe doing tape-ins? Are things moving forward? Have you seen any acceleration? Have you seen hesitation or maybe wait-and-see from those customers? I'm just trying to figure out how that stuff is progressing on 18A? Thanks.\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Let me just clarify, the $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deals, right? So this isn't a pipeline. This is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that, Matt, because I think your question suggests that the pipeline. There's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging and we're seeing a significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK, right, and now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors, and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future, but this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips coming based on the PDK that we've just released. So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area. I'd say, we do believe that we'll have further updates there, but as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there given the supply base and the traditional operation of the Foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter, more updates to come. Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap us up. Thank you for joining our call. We appreciate the time as always. And I'd say on a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up where we'll have some further updates. I want to reiterate in a quarter like this that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved of this phase, but now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we rightsize. We rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success. Thanks, and good afternoon, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process roadmaps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations due in part by our decision to more quickly ramp core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments. We previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AI PC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate and extend our leadership and drive significant benefits in the years to come. Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in second half of 2025. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performant and cost-competitive process, which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in-house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost-reduction plan we announced today. This plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model, which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. Having separate financial reporting for Intel Products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company. It also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources, taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and headcount beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a headcount reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025 with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family. These are hard, but necessary decisions. Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx targeted at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates. We expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy. Our new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 billion and $27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. Combined with strong execution of our smart capital strategy, including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion to $14 billion. Increased capital efficiency has a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly $1 billion of savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. We designed our smart capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trend line growth, while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost-effectively capture upside when it comes. We are taking the added step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. We reiterate our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels. Reductions across OpEx, CapEx, and cost of sales total well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long-term strategy. We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera, and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter-on-quarter. With improved client inventory levels exiting Q3, we see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range. Let me now provide more details by our key business units, starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive five-nodes-in-four-years march and the finish line is officially within sight. We are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3, and Intel 20A is been ready for production next quarter. On Intel 18A, we released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year with production wafer start volumes in first half of 2025. Panther Lake for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use RibbonFet, PowerVia, and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. Clearwater Forest for server, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities is booted and likewise looking very healthy. These are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market. Importantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in four years, completing an historic pace of design and process innovation and returning Intel to process leadership. Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started and once we do, it will unlock further growth and value creation across our Foundry and Product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading-edge capacity continues to weigh on near-term profitability, but long term, they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024 and then driving to breakeven. To help accelerate [Technical Difficulty] our Foundry Services business, Kevin has led large foundry and fabless businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running [Technical Difficulty] considerable time with current and future Foundry customers as we ramp our process packaging and chipset capabilities for the AI era. We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our Foundry Manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. Overall, our Foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners. In Q2, Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge advanced packaging technology. EMIB makes it possible to cost-effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well underway on Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation on our process roadmap, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D and capital spending requirements. Let's now turn to Intel Products. In our largest and most profitable business, CCG, we continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our roadmap. The AI PC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience and Intel is at the forefront of this category creating moment. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AI PCs since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year end, and over 100 million accumulative by the end of 2025. Lunar Lake, our next-generation AI PC, which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July, will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh. Lunar Lake delivers superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3 times more tops Gen-on-Gen with our enhanced NPU and will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs, which will begin to ship this quarter. Lunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake, which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong roadmap over the next 18 months. Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation of which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeon powering data centers around the world today, and our roadmap is designed to build upon this vast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible, and scalable and reduce total cost of ownership for customers. We took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-core processors, formerly codenamed Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high-density to scale our workloads. It drives performance up, power down, and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-Core, codenamed Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and will begin shipping this quarter. Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product featuring our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power-on and is on track to launch in 2025. As we've reestablished Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in AI servers. We are also focused on improving our accelerator roadmap. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility, and value that is very compelling to customers, particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable, cost-effective Gen AI solutions. Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks, and reference designs combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or Open Platform for Enterprise AI, are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level, at just two-thirds the cost of competitive offerings. To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2 times performance per dollar in both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support, including Dell Technologies, Hewert-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, Gigabyte, Inventec, Quanta Cloud Technology, and Wistron. Turning to NEX, we continue to see stability in Q2, while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI Network Interface Card and Foundry Chiplets, which we'll launch next year. Our recent IPU adapter for the enterprise supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat broadens access to the solution co-developed with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low latency communication for scale up AI systems, communication, and data centers. Combined with the growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well-positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate focus and resources to realize their growth opportunities and execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders, similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye two years ago and IMS last year. Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying, it has been a hard fought first half of the year. We have achieved several important milestones and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus and renewed intensity to up our gain and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. With that, I'll pass it over to Dave. Yes. Thank you, Vivek. I'll start out, would say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration, and rebuilding plan is now well underway. With 18A, PDK 1.0, with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered-on, our geo footprint now starting to take shape, we have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on Phase 2, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace and we're just now getting to competitiveness. But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long-term journey. I'd say this rebuilding that we're underway, this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors four decades ago. We firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building two world-class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise as we could describe it, is building a world-class Intel Foundry and building a world-class Intel Products Group. These efforts we believe have identified many opportunities for us to have financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today, and we believe that with the new products, a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation that we see the long-term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders. Yes, thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally, we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The CHIPS grants -- taking your questions sort of one-by-one, on the CHIP side, these are milestone-based investments. We still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the CHIPS model that we've put in place, we've worked closely with the CHIPS program office in the U.S. government, we're very comfortable on those plans. Also, the foundry, we are seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities. So the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to. Obviously, with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving just like a world-class foundry does to be much more efficient with our capital investments and scrutinizing them more carefully. And now that we've paid the capital to catch up, and I'll view -- this catch-up capital, we had no spare capacity, we had no site ahead, show ahead. We had no capacity to catch up. As those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well as the foundry commitments that we have in place. Finally, I'll just say, again, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments up and down appropriately, and we've now established a model with our smart capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we said for our strategy on track and we're now moving into Phase 2 of the execution of that strategy. Yes, let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world-class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world-class foundries and that's what Intel Foundry is going to become, and that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively, and every aspect of that business is being analyzed and how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots and everything like that so clean sheet analysis. Similarly, on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world-class fabulous company look like. And we uncover quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build-in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world-class Fabless company, and these are significant structural steps. We also realized that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency. We were built for leadership. And now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the four business areas, client, networking, and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future, and similarly, the portfolio of our Intel Foundry business and that's the work that we've now been undertaking and we're now accelerating based on the less than expected quarterly results, we're accelerating those impacts. We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near-term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. We believe the long-term guidance that we've given you, the 60:40, getting to the Foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've said, those are larger portions of our business. We believe those are long-term still achievable in that regard and we're on track for many of those things in the models that we're laying out and today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those. And just one thing to add on top of that, just to clarify, with Panther Lake already powered on, right, and showing good health, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year, right? So we'll start to see some of those benefits, but obviously, the huge volume benefits of that really are in 2026, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process with a more competitive product with Panther Lake, offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring Tiles home with a more competitive product and a more competitive process, and that really is, I'll say, the story that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year. Yes, thank you. And obviously, Sierra Forest, right, E-core product, very efficient, but a new category for us, so we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback, very positive. As we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it, but it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the peak core, I'll say, the more traditional Xeon for us and we'll start that ramp this quarter. But we'll take as anything in the server market, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer-term cycle for that. But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids, even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI build-out, as you know. So in this environment, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint. So we're having to fight to win those socket back, but Granite Rapids looks very positive. The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design, 8A, this level of health, this are early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-Core version of that on 18A is also showing very good -- not in fab yet, but showing a very good design progress. So we feel like the roadmap gets more competitive, and with it, we believe our market share position is fairly, I'll say, static, right? So year-on-year, we do see that overall the arm market share is more modest in the second half this year, so the X86 share, and we're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen for our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged and we're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, including ours. So a lot of things to unpack there, but we do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products and the roadmap only improves from here. Yes. Thanks, Joe. And we do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us and we do have some early indications of a positive cycle there, but I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications, but we are starting to see, I'll say, better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. Similarly, for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place. The TCO benefits of a server refresh now as we start talking about 3X, 4X consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional, right, cloud environments, their container delivery environments, these are quite substantial. So we do believe that as our products get to be more competitive, right, and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, that the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course, the story is CPU plus GPU, right, and that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously, as Gaudi 3 starts shipping the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA, that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building toward. Yes, thank you. And at the highest level, the Foundry strategy unchanged. And we've built capacity corridor for Foundry customers. However, until we have committed orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shells and the sites that we have in place. And how much of that corridor we keep available, how much flexibility working with our equipment suppliers that we need for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. We've also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecast. So all of those are, say, are adjustments. The big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build-out, right, and as you think about what we had to catch up, we had no EUV capacity. We had no shell ahead, side ahead capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home. As those come into place, we've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years, and now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in 2024, 2025, and 2026. So we're putting much more aggressive view of capital utilization, right? How much capital require ahead of working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars, just like a foundry does? And for that, we'll point you back to again, right, we're going to be a world-class fabless company. Intel Products, we're going to be a world-class Foundry with Intel Foundry. The last point I'd make here on this is a lot of the early success that we're having with foundry customers is advanced packaging. And there, the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there. Customers in advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity, but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have as, and we've described before, as the on-ramp for Intel Foundry and that's continuing to look very good. The final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, right, to the first order, the Intel product requirements. And clearly, there's a lot of tiles externally in 2025, we bring those home in 2026, that's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, see the benefits of the model that we've put in place. Tiles coming home, leadership process technology, leadership products starts in 2025, deliver big-time in 2026 and beyond. Yes, it becomes a tailwind. As the Ireland factory ramps, a production factory will have a lower-cost per wafer start than a TV factory like Oregon. So it becomes a headwind as we go into next year. And I was just going to add one thing, as we move the Intel 4, Intel 3 capacity into Ireland, it also gives our TD team more focus on their capital on 18A as well as then 14A and 10A, and we're taking, for instance, the second high NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A. So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AI PC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision and optimizing the use of our TD resources for the next-generation technologies, which are already well underway and showing good early indicators. Clearly, that's our objective for Dave and I. You all say that said, we have a lot of wood to chop until we complete that journey. The steps that we've taken today are significant, right, ones for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly that's our operating objective that we have. But as we said, 2026 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, the new process technologies. So I'd say that 2027 timeframe is still a good one, but you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability. And the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus, right, will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel Foundry, $10 billion next year is a big number and we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry-forward in 2026. Dave said, an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive, so everything that we're doing is aligned with our thought, Srini. Yes. I'll take that Matt. We feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AI PC. Here we have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell-in and sell-through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels, where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given some inventory sell-through in the third quarter above seasonal in Q4. Overall, the TAM expansion is low-single-digit, even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AI PC and further TAM expansion as we go into 2025 as expected now broadly. We'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our vPro assets and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. We also saw things like vPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike Blue Screen period and customers who are vPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on vPro took weeks to recover from that. So a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem, the leadership that we have on AI PC. And as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So I think we're very comfortable and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes. Yes. Let me just clarify, the $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deals, right? So this isn't a pipeline. This is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that, Matt, because I think your question suggests that the pipeline. There's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging and we're seeing a significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK, right, and now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors, and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future, but this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips coming based on the PDK that we've just released. So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area. I'd say, we do believe that we'll have further updates there, but as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there given the supply base and the traditional operation of the Foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter, more updates to come. Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap us up. Thank you for joining our call. We appreciate the time as always. And I'd say on a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up where we'll have some further updates. I want to reiterate in a quarter like this that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved of this phase, but now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we rightsize. We rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success. Thanks, and good afternoon, everybody."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1 point year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction, which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth, offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses. Profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations with Q2 gross margin of 38.7% and EPS of $0.02. Weaker than expected gross margin was due to three main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AI PC product. In addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 Core Ultra shipments, we made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and Intel 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and Intel 3 gross margin long-term as we scale up the Ireland fab. Margins were also impacted by higher than typical period charges related to non-core businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital. Gross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion. Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year. The client business grew 9% year-over-year as the AI PC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs, partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter. DCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down 3 points year-over-year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat both sequentially and year-over-year, so excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market, NEX delivered 10% year-over-year growth in the first half. Q2 operating profit for Intel Products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue and up approximately $400 million year-over-year, on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes, Intel 4 and Intel 3. Foundry Services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base, including the start of advanced packaging revenue. Foundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3 with more than 85% of wafer volumes still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power performance and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and Intel 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and start-up costs to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability. Mobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to non-recurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion, and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many Western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half. Altera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double-digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns. Now turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year, along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3 with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets. With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter. We expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes. While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability, a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AI PC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the third quarter. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03, all on a non-GAAP basis. As Pat discussed earlier, lower than anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response. These actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently. Additionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 billion to $27 billion with a net capital spending of $11 billion to $13 billion, including our SCIP programs. These adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges necessary to achieve our spending targets. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 billion to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization, and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage. Before I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple of items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from Street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within non-variable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion. While that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall-through for gross margin next year. The AI PC is a big winner for the company and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We therefore intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the product is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year. The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on 18A and has a much improved cost structure. As the momentum of AI PCs drives Panther Lake demand, together with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion in subsequent years. Lastly, the non-controlled income from Mobileye, Altera, and IMF and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners show up on a line below net income called non-controlling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years. In closing, the market has not recovered as expected and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting 2025 spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions, while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results, leveraging our new operating model. We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies, and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model of 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A. Yes, sure. On the client side, obviously, we feel very good given our AI PC position, we're leading that new product category. And I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake and the performance of that, so that looks like a phenomenally good product and position. We're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center and that's only going to grow as we go into next year. The big question is when does the kind of traditional CPU market recover? It has been tempered this year, and of course, affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. That's obviously been a soft space and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then NEX, obviously also outside of the telco space is starting to recover. And then we have these other businesses, Altera is starting to recover now. So we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them and we'll have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately. I think on the margin front, I talked about our kind of tempered view of gross margins next year, given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which with memory and package and almost all of the material getting sourced outside and they're seeing -- we're seeing inflation in that space that is impacting it. But that part is followed by Panther Lake, that comes back into the fab. And I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of the capacity that we had to move into the external sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of -- in terms of profitability. And then, of course, we've done a lot, as Pat talked about in terms of restructuring the business and those will start to show up next year, but will be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out, both in the kind of medium term and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And if we do get the growth, it puts us in an even better position. Yes. So as I talked about to Ross, CJ, the good news for 2026 for us is that, that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles and so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of less of a headwind for us, so that will also be helpful. And then like I said, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way, both from the actions we've taken today, but the new operating model and decisions will get made on a go-forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward. I think 2026 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out. I think from a mix perspective, it's probably not going to be a big headwind or tailwind for us, just strict mix other than as we move towards more leading-edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will -- that will be one factor that will certainly help us. It also -- in that regard, that also helps us on the pricing side because, obviously, from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers. And then ultimately, I think on pricing, it will really come down to when we have a competitive process and we have competitive products running on a competitive process and we're delivering what the customers want, that helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic. And we're getting to the place as Pat talked about where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through the next few years. Yes. I'll say, given that some of the actions we're taking will kind of go through at least the early part of next year, we're going to enter at a higher number than we're going to exit, I'll give you that. And we should be down in 2026 relative to 2025. Give me some time as we progress through the year to start to fine-tune the budget for 2026 and I'll give you more clarity around that. Yes. Okay. That was the biggest one. Let me -- I'll just say that there were a couple of other things that we had to do some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower that did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake, Intel 3, and even run production on Intel 4 -- sorry, Intel 4, and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab. We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice essentially. And it starts to mature the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes in Ireland more quickly. The downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now. And so we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system and that puts pressure on the margins. That's going to carry into next quarter. I mean, we will do better in next quarter, obviously, but we're going to do more volume and the margins will be below the corporate average because of -- because while we're improving the wafer cost, it's not -- still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. And so it will weigh down on margins for the third quarter as well. After that, we start -- it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better and the situation on Meteor Lake will improve meaningfully. I'm sorry, the second question is how much will the headwind be on... On an ongoing basis is what you're saying? Okay. All right. So I think the best way to think about it is, we were -- I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin taking into account revenue was part of it. It was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-offs related to legacy businesses and the mix and underutilization also affected and it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. And that will be the case in the third quarter probably given the increase. I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter. Beyond that, it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's actually not going to be a headwind. Yes, exactly. Tailwind as we go into... Now as we -- now the challenge for next year will be, we'll now be ramping Lunar Lake next year. Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, so we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins. And additionally, it's got more of the content sourced externally, and as you know, we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of the -- Meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel Products margins, which is why we're tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel Foundry side. It's going to be tempered on the product side and it's really going to be because of Lunar Lake."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intel Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. \n And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. \nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. \n I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. \n Our earnings release, most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to corresponding GAAP financial measures. \n With that, let me turn things over to Pat. \nPatrick Gelsinger: Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone. \n We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints. We continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by: one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs; two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings; and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye and Altera. \n We had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness and perhaps, most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer. We also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our road map with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. \n Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the National Semiconductor Champion along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives and loans. During the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro and Roche, among many others who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions. \n Vision went straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the open platform for enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate gen AI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or REG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. \n Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors. We are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year-to-date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company 3 years ago. Job #1 was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. \n The heart of Phase 1 was 5 nodes in 4 years. The rallying cry was toured. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our Grovian culture and execution engine and are on track to completing our 5 nodes 4-year goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception. In so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter. Furthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of the Intel 18A in these products in the first half of '25 for product release in the middle of next year. \n Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a founder relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost. This quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company. Separating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. \n This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners, we knew that the day 1 P&L for Intel foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve. I'm going to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. And you can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets. If we can move faster and do better, we will, and our new operating model is already catalyzing change in driving efficiencies across the organization. \n Let me highlight 3 important aspects of our business and our strategy that is underscored by the new model. First, with Intel products, we have exposed a solid fabless franchise with established, powerful and hard to displace installed base and ecosystem across enterprise, consumer and edge that provide meaningful benefits to our customers and partners. Intel products is a solidly profitable business today despite just recently emerging from a semiconductor downturn and still competing with legacy process technology. That is changing rapidly as we ramp Intel 3 in 2024 and Intel 18A in 2025. \n We then claim, we are defining and leading the AI PC category. IDC indicates the overall PC market is now expanding. And as stated earlier, as standards emerge and applications begin to take advantage of new AI embedded capabilities, we see demand signals improving, especially in second half of the year, helped by a likely corporate refresh. \n Our Core Ultra ramp, led by Meteor Lake, continues to accelerate beyond our original expectation, with units expected to double sequentially in Q2, limited only by our supply of wafer-level assembly. Improving second half Meteor Lake supply, and the addition of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake later this year, will allow us to ship in excess of our original 40 million AI PC CPU target in 2024. Next year, with Panther Lake, we will extend our lead with Intel 18A and further product enhancements. Our share position is strong and continues to strengthen as we execute on our product road map. Within DC AI, as committed, we have achieved product release on our first Intel 3 server product, the first-generation E-Core Xeon 6, codename Sierra Forest. \n The next-generation P-Core Xeon 6 product, Granite Rapids, will be released in Q3. At Vision, we demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Xeon 6 with good performance. We continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in 2025. While budgets are still being prioritized to generative AI build-out, where we have a strong position in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving signs for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second half. Our first Intel 18A product, Clearwater Forest, is slated to launch next year and will allow us to accelerate share gains. Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in accelerated computing for the data center and cloud. \n We now expect over $500 million in accelerated revenue in second half of 2024, with increasing momentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO as well as our own expanding supply. In addition, we are finding good traction with the Intel Developer Cloud with customers onboarding with this platform, including Dell and Zeekr, our largest IDC win to date. We are encouraged by our progress but far from satisfied. Lastly, within NEX, the business has stabilized and beat our Q1 targets with channel inventories approaching normal levels and business acceleration expected through the year as a result. We also recently announced our plans for scale up and scale out Ethernet-based AI networking delivered as a discrete NIC and chiplets for AI foundry customers with numerous key providers in the industry and market standardization through the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. \n So that is Intel products, good momentum and a lot for us to build on. Let me turn to Intel Foundry. We are executing on our strategy to drive meaningful improvement in profitability over time. We are obviously not there yet, given the large upfront investment we needed to build out this business. But we always said this was going to be a multiyear plan, and we are right on track with where we expect it to be right now. As we discussed during our webinar at the beginning of the month, the transition from pre-EUV wafers to post-EUV wafers is a powerful tailwind for us. We expect our blended average wafer pricing to grow 3x faster than cost over the decade, driving significant margin expansion. \n In addition, more competitive wafers will allow us to bring home many of the tiles that today are being manufactured at external foundries. Both dynamics are in our control and not dependent on revenue growth and are key elements to drive the business to breakeven, more than doubling our current earnings power at the Intel consolidated level. Of course, more competitive wafers combined with our position as the only company manufacturing with leading-edge wafers outside of Asia, is drawing strong interest from potential external customers. It is important to note that our leadership in advanced packaging creates more value in our wafer technologies and wafer-level assembly, and base die opportunities further fill our factories and extend the useful life of our tools for increased financial returns. \n I am pleased to announce that this quarter, we signed another meaningful customer on Intel 18A, bringing our total to 6. A leader in the aerospace and defense industry, this customer chose Intel Foundry based not only on the process technology benefits of Intel 18A, but also because of their desire to have a secure U.S.-only supply base. Just this week, we were very pleased to announce that the DoD awarded Intel Foundry Phase III of the RAMP-C program, which we are confident will lead to additional federal aerospace and defense customers. \n More broadly, we are seeing growing interest in Intel 18A and we continue to have a strong pipeline of nearly 50 test chips. The near-term interest in Intel Foundry continues to be strongest with advanced packaging, which now includes engagements with nearly every foundry customer in the industry, including 5 design awards. While we are highly focused on improving the near-term profitability of Intel Foundry, it is also important that we keep sight of the long-term opportunity here. \n The foundry market is expected to grow from $110 billion today to $240 billion by 2030, with almost 90% of the growth coming from EUV nodes and advanced packaging. Given this backdrop, we have clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030, building on our EUV High-NA process technology leadership in advanced packaging, manufacturing capacity, our systems expertise and the surge in AI demand. Put it another way, our $15 billion of external revenue embedded in our Intel Foundry target model would represent less than 15% of the leading edge foundry market. It is not a question of if but when Intel Foundry achieves escape velocity. And every day, we are proving to the market that Intel Foundry is a resilient, sustainable and trusted alternative to serve a semi market on a path to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade. \n Let me wrap up by speaking to our All Other category, where our #1 priority is to unlock shareholder value. This quarter, we formally rebranded our Programmable Solutions Group, Altera, an Intel company. We look forward to bringing in a private equity partner this year to help prepare the company for an IPO in the coming years. This puts Altera on a similar path as Mobileye. We are excited about the future of both companies. By providing them with separation and autonomy, we believe we enhance their ability to capitalize on their growth opportunities in their respective market and accelerate their path to create value. Combined with IMS, our mask writing equipment business, we believe these 3 assets represent more than 1/4 of our overall market value today. Along with a solid Intel products franchise and an Intel Foundry business rapidly approaching $100 billion in net tangible assets, we see the opportunity to unlock significant value for our shareholders as we meet our financial commitments, stand up Intel Foundry and drive it to profitability and further leverage our opportunity in AI. So overall, I'll say that there's a lot for us to build on coming out of Q1. We are systematically executing to our strategy, and we are making steady progress. We are maniacally focused on executional excellence and fiscal discipline and we are relentless in our drive to regain process leadership and bring next-generation solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. \n All of this gives me confidence in where we are headed. Yes, we have a lot of hard work in front of us, but we know what we need to do and the payoff will be significant in the end. Semiconductors are the currency that will drive the global economy for decades to come. We are one of 2, maybe 3 companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies and the only one that has Western capacity and R&D, and we will participate in the entire AI market. Quarter-by-quarter, we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. \n With that, let me turn things over to Dave. \nDavid Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. \n We delivered solid results in the quarter with revenue finishing in line and gross margin and EPS, again beating guidance. Forward-looking demand signals in our core markets improved at a measured pace through the first quarter, and we expect to deliver full year revenue and EPS growth in 2024, with the pace of revenue growth accelerating in the second half. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year and just above the midpoint of our guidance, with product segments performing in line with expectations. Intel Products delivered 17% year-over-year growth, offset by inventory headwinds impacting Mobileye, Altera and our 5G customers as well as the sunsetting of several noncore lines of business including the traditional packaging business within Intel Foundry. \n These noncore revenue headwinds drove a sequential decline of just over $1 billion, in line with our Q1 guidance. Gross margin was 45.1%, 60 basis points above guidance, and EPS of $0.18 beat guidance by $0.05 on operating spending discipline and strong sell-through of previously reserved inventory. \n Q1 operating cash flow was negative $1.2 billion. Net CapEx was $5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.2 billion and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. We expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted free cash flow, driven by seasonal factors, including timing of annual bonus payments, along with upsides from larger capital offsets expected in the second half. \n As Pat mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting in the new operating segments. The revised structure creates a foundry relationship between manufacturing and our products groups with Intel Products purchasing wafers and services from Intel Foundry at fair market prices. This quarter represents another important step in our transformation, with increased transparency and accountability across all layers of the organization, which is already having a positive impact on decision-making efficiencies and financial discipline. \n As I talk about our results, I'll categorize them between Intel Products, Intel Foundry and All Other, with the All Other category, including the results of Mobileye and Altera. Additional detail can be found in our earnings release and SEC filings. Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The client business grew by more than 30% year-over-year with a strong product portfolio and share position and significantly improved customer inventory levels. The data center and AI business contributed 5% year-over-year growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. \n NEX revenue declined 8% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant declines in the 5G market, partially offset by approximately 10% year-over-year growth in our network and edge markets, which we expect to continue to recover through the year. Intel Products' operating profit expanded by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, better sell-through of reserved inventory and operating spending discipline, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 28% in the quarter. \n Intel foundry revenue was $4.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year on lower back-end services and sample revenue, along with lower IMS tool sales. In addition, wafer volume was modestly higher in the quarter, with ASPs modestly down, driven by pricing for mature nodes. Operating profit declined by approximately $100 million year-over-year, with lower revenue being partially offset by improved factory utilization. \n Op margin declined significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher start-up costs and the conclusion of the traditional packaging business impacting revenue. The foundry P&L will remain challenged through the year, and we expect operating margins to trough in 2024 as start-up costs associated with 5 nodes in 4 years peak and the P&L absorbs an expected increase of roughly $2 billion in depreciation. Beyond 2024, as volume begins to shift toward leadership manufacturing nodes with a competitive cost structure scale improves, including the return of compute tiles to internal process nodes and our efficiency actions begin to flow through the P&L, we expect to see rapid profitability improvement. \n Mobileye revenue of $239 million and an operating loss of $68 million were both down meaningfully year-over-year due to a well-publicized drawdown of iQ customer inventory. Mobileye reiterated full year guidance on their earnings call this morning. With the inventory digestion process on track, financial results are expected to recover quickly. Altera revenue was $342 million, down significantly year-over-year, with results impacted by the industry-wide inventory digestion following supply constraints in 2022 and '23. Altera's $39 million operating loss is a result of lower revenue and spending associated with standing up Altera as a stand-alone company. \n We continue to expect Altera to exit 2024 at a $2 billion revenue run rate as inventory positions normalize. I want to acknowledge the hard work and focused execution across the company to transition our systems and processes to our new reporting structure. We're already seeing the results of the increased transparency catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the company. \n Now turning to our Q2 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the second quarter, with the midpoint aligned to typical seasonal growth. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 43.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.10, all on a non-GAAP basis. We see the client and data center business roughly flat to Q1 results at the low end of seasonal. Q2 client revenue is constrained by wafer-level assembly supply, which is impacting our ability to meet demand for our Core Ultra-based AI PCs. We do expect sequential growth from Mobileye, NEX and foundry services. \n As we look beyond Q2 guidance, we expect growth across all segments in the second half of the year, led by improved demand for general purpose servers from both cloud and enterprise customers and increased core ultra assembly capacity to support a growing PC TAM, driven by enterprise refresh and the AI PC. We should also see accelerating growth from our network and edge businesses, a return to growth for Altera and a meaningful Gaudi ramp in the second half. \n Despite 2024 representing the peak for 5 node and 4-year driven factory start-up costs, we expect roughly 200 basis points of FY '24 gross margin improvement compared to FY '23. Our net capital intensity forecast of mid-30s as a percent of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate remains unchanged. With significant capital offsets expected to land in the second half of the year, we continue to expect approximately neutral 2024 adjusted free cash flow. While first half demand signals have been a bit weaker, Q1 played out largely in line with our expectations. We achieved several important milestones towards our IDM 2.0 vision, and we're participating in a large and growing TAM with encouraging market signals for the second half of the year and into 2025. By capturing margin at both the foundry level and the fabless product level, we have margin stacking advantage unique in the industry. We are 3 years into our transformation, and 2024 represents the steepest part of the climb, with 5 node and 4-year start-up cost peaking and the majority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics. However, as we crest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong wins at our back and a clear path to achieving the mid- and long-term financial targets we laid out earlier this month. \n With that, let me turn the call back over to John. \nJohn Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question? \nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. \nRoss Seymore: I guess for my first question, I wanted to dive into the demand side of the equation. What was weaker in the near term than you had expected? And much more importantly, it seems like the back half you're going to have double-digit sequential growth in largely both quarters, so that's significantly above seasonal. I know you went through some of the reasons at a high level, but can you dive a little bit deeper into what gives you that level of confidence in the second half ramp? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Starting out, so Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just say the market was weaker. You've seen that in a number of others that have commented as well. So I'll say somewhat across the board a bit. We've seen that, cloud customers, enterprise, across geos. So I'll just say a bit weaker demand, right, we'll just say at the low end of seasonality Q1 to Q2 that we saw. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're engaging deeply with our customers today, our OEM partners, and we just see strength across the board, right? \n Part of that is driven by our unique product position, some of it driven by the market characteristics and client, AI PC and a second half Windows upgrade cycle, we believe, underway and Core Ultra is hot. And as we said, even in Q2, we're racing -- we're meeting all of our commitments, but not all of the upside requests that we're seeing from customers. So we see a very strong AI PC outlook in the data center. As we bring in our new products, we're seeing ASPs increase very healthy on our data center products and with products like CR4 that we just went to production with this week on Intel 3, we're seeing improved product position as well for competitiveness. \n We have the $0.5 billion of Gaudi, right? And most of that is second half loaded. And the All Other businesses coming out of inventory positions in Altera and Mobileye and NEX, all of those improved first half to second half as well. And then incremental, I'll just say, Intel Foundry, every quarter from here until the decade and we're seeing improvement in the Intel Foundry. And one by one, we're seeing all of those business improvements both on revenue and margin improvements over time. So we feel very comfortable that the second half outlook is quite strong for the business, a first half a bit weaker, but we think it's very understandable, very explainable, and a second half outlook that will be very comfortable for every business across Intel growing and a lot of momentum as we go into '25. \nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up? \nRoss Seymore: I do. Maybe for Dave, on the gross margin side, nice upside in the first quarter, but the drop in the second quarter is a little bit puzzling with revenues going up. So could you just talk a little bit about that second quarter drop and then the confidence in the rebound in the second half? Is that just revenue driven in the second half? Or what's the key metrics there, please? \nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good. Thanks, Ross. Maybe start with Q1 because it somewhat explains Q2. We had better sell-through of product. I hadn't even mentioned Meteor Lake strength. That better sell-through was on previously reserved material. And so we just saw some upside in gross margins because of that. We had a little bit more of a flattish plan between Q1 and Q2 in terms of how that would flow through. And so it kind of pulled some of the benefit of gross margin improvement we would have seen in Q2 and kind of pulled it into Q1. So that was part of it. \n The second part is, as we talked about, this year was going to be a heavy year for start-up cost for us. And it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4, that will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins, helping us like, for example, Mobileye, we get good gross margin for Mobileye and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. \n As we look into '25, I think we'll have better gross margins than '25 than we had in '24. So this should be an ongoing story for us on the gross margin front. And as you know, we're driving to get to kind of mid-50s gross margins by the midpoint between now and 2030 and ultimately getting to 60%. Of course, revenue will be part of that. But a lot of that is within our control. It's things like 18A wafer pricing growing at 3x the cost of 18A that will help drive margins. The pull-in of tiles, as Pat mentioned, internally is going to drive better gross margins for us over time. All of what we're doing in terms of resegmenting new businesses to drive better decision-making, that better decision-making will translate into significant cost improvements for us, which should also be a meaningful driver for gross margins over time as well. And of course, as Pat mentioned, we're happy to get the CHIPS announcement out. And of course, that, coupled with what we expect from the EU and the investment tax credit will also be major tailwinds on gross margins over a long-term basis. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. \nBenjamin Reitzes: Appreciate the chance to ask a question here. Pat, can you talk a little bit more about servers in the data center? There was talk of a bottom there in previous discussions. How do you see that kind of going throughout the year in light of your 2Q guidance? And what's the catalyst for the pickup there? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Ben. And obviously, as we look at our position in the data center, I'll just say we're stabilizing. And with that, we're improving our competitiveness. We also see, as I mentioned in the comments, that the ASPs are going up comfortably as well. So socket fairly stable through the year, but the ASP per socket with increased core count improves our position. And then new products like Sierra Forest or Xeon Gen 6 product, definitely gives us power performance capabilities. So overall, we're seeing a very healthy growth rate, mid-20s as we go through the year. We're also seeing increasing interest in the AI capabilities of Xeon. And we're winning head node positions, and we're seeing pretty extraordinary performance at Vision. \n We talked about the ability to now run 70 billion parameter models directly on Xeon. And these type of capabilities, say, for a lot of enterprise use cases, Xeon is a very strong product. And as we laid out at Vision, the ability for Xeon plus Gaudi to start positioning this open platform for enterprise AI is a very strong position for us. So overall, we feel like we're on a solid trajectory into a market that even though it's been dominated by the gen AI theme as enterprises, our OEMs and ODMs are communicating, there's growth here in servers. And we now have a much better product position, improving ASPs and a better overall positioning in AI for a lot of these use cases where it's Xeon CPU plus GPU and accelerator. \nJohn Pitzer: Ben, do you have a quick follow-up? \nBenjamin Reitzes: Yes. Thanks. Can we just double-click also on Gaudi, $500 million in the back half of the year? I think you previously talked about a couple of billion in the pipeline. What does that say about your yield to revenue on an annualized basis with AI? And is there an update on the pipeline and your confidence there heading into 2025 on the accelerator front? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ben. And obviously, pipeline converting into revenue, revenue is much more meaningful and as we said, greater than $500 million for the year, and that's obviously quarter-on-quarter accelerating rapidly, which also gives a great indication for the business in '25 as well. At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their embrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. And I was super pleased to see the breadth of those customers. It was CSPs like Naver and Ola and IBM Cloud. It was ISVs like Zeekr, right, coming on board, but maybe most importantly, enterprise customers. \n And ultimately, gen AI training, okay, creating models, but enterprises are going to use models, and that's where our TCO benefits. The ability for us to action customers' data in their enterprise environment is so powerful and customers like Bosch were coming forward and Roche to be able to demonstrate the true benefits of Gaudi and Xeon plus Gaudi. The road map is in good shape. The Gaudi 3 Falcon Shores in '25. We're also seeing that the industry wants to open alternatives. And we announced our AI networking initiative, Ultra Ethernet Consortium standardizing on scale up and scale out to Ethernet, increasing work for abstract levels of AI development with PyTorch and the embrace of the open platform for enterprise AI that we rolled out. All of those taken together, the industry is looking for open enterprise alternatives for regenerative AI deployment and Intel are quite well positioned, and we're starting to really see that uptake in our Accelerator and Xeon pipeline now. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk to the server road map. It sounds like you're confirming the time frame for both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. Can you talk about -- is there demand for the Sierra Forest product as well? Do you expect that to be bifurcated where you see demand for both? And then how quickly will you see those products come to volume? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. So Sierra Forest, our first Xeon 6 product on Intel 3, and I'm super proud, right? Now we have a leadership process technology back on American soil for the first time in a decade. This is really exciting. And Sierra Forest, high core count, 144, 288 core product, very focused on power, performance, efficiency, and we do see a good pipeline of customers and a good pipeline of, I'll say, socket win backs because the area of power performance has been an area that we've been carrying a deficit, being on an older node. And now that we're on leadership nodes, we definitely see share gains for that. \n Of course, Granite Rapids, which will come in Q3, the Xeon 6 P-Core part is much more the bread and butter of the Xeon family. So we do see that being a stronger element to the portfolio this year as we haven't been participating in the power performance sockets as aggressively lately, and Sierra Forest gives us that tool. So it really is a one-two punch, as we've described. With Granite coming in Q3 and a volume ramp on Intel 3 with that, we feel we have a very good product line. \n Next year is Clearwater Forest, the second generation of the E-core part, the leadership position on 18A in the server market, a very strong product for us, unquestioned leadership and power performance, so I believe that's a great opportunity for us to gain share again in the data center. So the road map is healthy. The execution is strong, and we're rebuilding customer trust. They're looking at us now and saying, \"Oh, Intel is back.\" And we're quite excited by that. And then beyond that, building the volume, building the confidence and the momentum for traditional use cases as well as the AI use cases, as I just referred on Ben's question as well. \nJohn Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-up? \nJoseph Moore: Yes, I do. Thank you. On the foundry webinar, you had sort of talked about Intel 3 volume being kind of more of an inflection next year. Does that mean it was in server that these Intel 3 products are sort of get to volume crossover kind of some point next year? Or could we see -- obviously, the leadership you just talked about is important. What's kind of keeping you from getting those products ramping in the second half? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, Joe, thank you. And servers always just take a while to ramp. Customers bring them in, they qualify them, they test them because they're generally putting these things at scale. So there's just an adoption cycle for server products. And the numbers that I'm holding my team accountable for are some of the most aggressive volume ramps that we've ever achieved on server products. So we're driving them very hard. That said, in terms of the total wafer volume this year, right, it's dominated by Intel 7. And the Intel 4 and 3 wafer volumes become much more prominent next year, and that's what I was communicating on the webinar. \n But as we go through the year, you're going to start to see the wafer ASPs pick up as a result of Intel 4, 3 ramping at much better ASP points, better margins associated with those, and they will become much more prominent in the foundry P&L next year. But these are production ramps that are already underway on Intel 3. The Intel 4 ramp already underway. We began that second half of last year. So these wafer ramps are underway with volume productions, volume products that we're bringing to the marketplace, very confident in our ability. And then, of course, 18A as we deliver the PDK for that in Q2, the 1.0 PDK and we'll begin the volume ramps on Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake in the first half of next year for those products coming out. So we feel very comfortable with that overall picture that we've laid out. So thank you, Joe. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. \nVijay Rakesh: Just a quick question on the Grand Rapids, any thoughts on the timing? And do you expect to regain some computing share, server share there with those ramps? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. I'm building a little bit on the last question. Granite Rapids will come in Q3 of this year when we'll have the production release of that product. Same as -- it just takes some time for customers to get comfortable, qualify, and bring those products to marketplace. But Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, these are much more competitive power performance products on Intel 3. So we see them stabilizing and then giving us opportunity to regain share. And as we go into next year, we expect that we're regaining share as we end this year and go into next year. These are great products and we're going to be ramping them very aggressively with our customers. \nJohn Pitzer: Vijay, do you have a follow-up? \nVijay Rakesh: Yes. Thanks. Just on the GPU side, on the AI side, any parts on Falcon Shores? Any preliminary takes on that? How do you see that building out into '25? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter, extremely well received. And as I mentioned already, 20-plus customers for Gaudi 2, 3, so we're seeing that build. Obviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture, and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich -- a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PCIe card to it. This use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. Falcon Shores will just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.\n We also described customers coming on the Intel Developer Cloud, where we're getting these products very early in their life available for developers and enterprise customers. And customers like Zeekr, now our biggest Intel Developer Cloud win to date, are seeing the benefits. But the bigger story is how do we unleash the data assets of our enterprise customers, and that's things like the open platform for enterprise AI that we launched at Open Summit. So overall, a lot of good things happening to unleash the gen AI cycle for Intel. And of course, right, as we're doing this, AI is a hot market. We're participating across all of our segments, whether that's client, edge, enterprise or our foundry opportunities as well, delivering AI everywhere. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. \nTimothy Arcuri: Dave, I also wanted to ask about gross margin. You did say it's going to be better next year, but it is really whipping around a lot. And it looks like you sort of have to exit this year at 48 or maybe a little higher, which is already well above the 45.5 that you'll be at this year because you're guiding it up to 100 basis points. So I know you don't want to guide next year, but if you can even qualitatively help us, can you sustain those margins at that level? And I asked because last year, you sort of exited at 49% and then things crashed here during the first half of the year. So can you help us just think about what some of the puts and takes will be next year off of that high base if you're going to exit this year at? \nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question. So there will be additional start-up costs next year. We do think it on a percent of revenue basis, it will be lower. So that should help lift the margins. Of course, the expectation would be we see growth in revenue. That also should help. On top of that, we already are seeing good decision-making and changing decision-making around how we operate now under this new different business structure that we have at this point. A lot of that stuff doesn't actually show up in the P&L. We have all these decisions get made this year, but a lot of the decisions made -- sorry, a lot of the benefits to those decisions don't show up until next year and the year after. So we should see some benefit from that as well. \n The other thing that kind of has whipped this -- our margins around a bit over the last few years has been this notion where we reserve material all the way up until the PRQ Pat just mentioned that Sierra Forest just PRQ-ed. So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it will be more a function of revenue growth spending profile in the fabs, start-up costs that we have and the mix. \nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question? \nTimothy Arcuri: I do. I do, yes. So I want to ask about server CPU share. March -- I think the assumption for March was that service share was going to be pretty flat. So the question is, was that the case? And it sounds -- you sound maybe a little bit less optimistic, if I'm sort of reading between the lines, on share into the back half of the year, just given how long it takes these things to sort of impact your share. So your bullish outlook in the second half of the year, it sounds like it's more market-driven versus share driven. Can you just clarify that? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Well, overall, I like to say it's hard to predict, right, exactly how these will play out in light of the overall gen AI surge that we've seen. That said, products are good, right? We came into the year improving our market share position in the first quarter of the year. It does take time to ramp these new products. But better products, rebuilding trust with our customers that we're delivering on these and now hitting the, what we would call the early end of the cycles on these new products is giving us a lot of interest with the market and the customer. New use cases also demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Granite Rapids at our Vision event, all of these just make us more and more confident in our business execution. \n We're also seeing that we don't need SoC account to increase. The ASPs are going up with the core counts on our new leadership products as well. So all of those in a fairly optimistic view that we're getting from our OEMs and our channel partners for their view of upgrade cycles, building momentum from customers across the industry. \n We feel very comfortable that we're stabilizing our position. We have been improving our road map, and we do expect to see share gains as we end the year and go into '25. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. \nSrinivas Pajjuri: My question is on the client side. I think, Pat, you mentioned something about supply constraints impacting your 2Q outlook. If you could provide some color as to what's causing those supply constraints and when do you expect those to ease as we, I guess, go into the second half. And then in terms of your AI PCs, I think you've been talking about $40 million or so potentially shipping this year. Could you maybe put that into some context as to how it actually helps Intel? Is it just higher ASPs? Is it higher margin? I would think that these products also come with higher costs. I just want to understand how we should think about the benefit to Intel as these AI PCs ramp? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And overall, as we've seen, this is a hot product. The AI PC category, and we declared this as we finished last year, and we've just been incrementing up our AI PC or the Core Ultra product volumes throughout. We're meeting our customer commitments that we've had, but they've come back and asked for upside on multiple occasions across different submarkets. And we are racing to catch up to those upside request, and the constraint has been on the back end. Wafer-level assembly, one of the new capabilities that are part of Meteor Lake and our subsequent client products. So with that, we're working to catch up and build more wafer-level assembly capacity to meet those. \n How does it help us? Hey, it's a new category. And that new category of products will generally be at higher ASPs as your question suggests. But we also think it's new use cases, and new use cases over time create a larger TAM. It creates an upgrade cycle that we're seeing. It creates new applications, and we're seeing essentially every ISV AI-ing their app, whether it's the communications capabilities of Zoom and team for translation and contextualization, whether it's new security capabilities with CrowdStrike and others finding new ways to do security on the client or it's way other creators and gamers taking advantage of this. \n So we see that every PC is going to become an AI PC over time. And when you have that kind of cycle underway, Srini, everybody starts to say, \"Oh, how do I upgrade my platform?\" And we even demonstrated how we're using AI PC in the Intel factories now to improve yields and performance inside of our own factories. And as I've described it, it's like a Centrino moment, right, where Centrino ushered in WiFi at scale. We see the AI PC ushering in these new use cases at scale, and that's going to be great for the industry. But as the unquestioned market leader, right, the leader in the category creation, we think we're going to differentially benefit from the emergence of the AI PC. \nJohn Pitzer: Srini, do you have a follow-up? \nSrinivas Pajjuri: Yes, John. Thank you. And I guess my other question is on the other bucket. I think, Dave, you kind of talked about Altera potentially exiting the year at a $2 billion run rate from current levels. That's a pretty steep ramp. And also, I think you said next growth will accelerate over the next couple of quarters. So -- and given the telecom weakness out there that we're seeing, I'm just curious as to what's giving you that visibility or confidence. I mean is this driven by some new products? Or is it just the market recovering? Any color would be helpful. \nDavid Zinsner: Yes. On Altera, and this is not unprecedented when you see a massive work down of inventory, of course, that significantly impacts the revenue. But as that normalizes, then you start shipping to end consumption. So it's actually a pretty easy lift to get to the $2 billion mark once we're through the inventory digestion period. So I think we have high confidence on that. \nPatrick Gelsinger: And others have commented on their inventory cycles as well in the FPGA category. We have good products in the second half of the year, with Agilex starting to ramp as well. \nDavid Zinsner: And then on NEX, of course, that business also has gone through its own inventory adjustment. So we have good confidence around that reversing, which will help drive strength. And then some of the products that are more tailored to the AI space, of course, we'll see like, at NEX, for example, we'll see strength through the year. And so that should drive good revenue growth through the year as well. \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. And also in NEX, the AI networking products are strong, our IPU products, we're seeing strength in that area. So it's inventory as well as products. Even though, as your question suggests, the communication sector and the service providers, that is weaker through the year, but pretty much every aspect of their business in edge AI, as Dave said, is seeing strength as we go into the second half of the year and into '25. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: Pat, just a conceptual question. In a gen AI server with accelerators, how important is the role of a specific CPU? Or is it easily interchangeable between yours or AMD's or ARM's? I guess the question is that if most of the workload is being done on the accelerator, does it really matter which CPU I use? And can that move towards gen AI servers, essentially shrink the TAM for x86 server CPUs, because a number of your cloud customers have announced ARM-based server alternatives. So I'm just curious, how do you think about that conversion over to gen AI and what that means for x86 server CPU TAM going forward? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. And we spoke at our Vision event about use cases like RAG, retrievable augmented generation, where the LLMs might run on an accelerator, but all of the real-time data, all of the databases, all of the embedding is running on the CPU. So you're seeing all of these data environments, which are already running on Xeon and x86 being augmented with AI capabilities to feed an LLM. And I believe this whole area of RAG becomes one of the primary use cases for enterprise AI. And if you think about it, an LLM might be trained with 1-, 2-year old data, right? But many of the business processes and environment are real time, right? \n You're not going to be retraining constantly. And that's where this area of the front-end database becomes very prominent. All of those databases run on x86 today. All of them are being enhanced for use cases like RAG. And that's why we see this unlock occurring because the data sits on-prem, the data sits in the x86 database environments that are all being enhanced against these use cases. And as we've shown, we don't need accelerators in some cases. We can run a 70 billion parameter model natively on Xeon with extraordinary TCO value for customers. And furthermore, all of the IT environments that enterprises run today, they have the security, they have the networking, they have the management technologies in place. \n They don't need to upgrade or change those from any of those use cases. So we see a lot of opportunity here to build on the enterprise asset that we have with the Xeon franchise, but we're also going to be aggressively augmenting that. And we're commonly the head node, even when it's other accelerators are being used or other GPU is being used. And as we've described, Xeon plus Gaudi, we think is going to be a very powerful opportunity for enterprises. \n So in many of those cases, we see this as a market lift, new applications, new use cases, new energy coming to the enterprise AI. Here we are in year 23 of the cloud, and while 60% of the workload has moved to the cloud, over 80% of the data remains on-prem under the control of the enterprise, much of that underutilized in businesses today. That's what gen AI is going to unlock. And a lot of that is going to happen through the x86 CPU and we see a powerful cycle emerging. And I would just point you back to what we described at Vision. This was a great event and many customers are seeing that value today. \nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a quick follow-up? \nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you. Maybe one for Dave on the potential operating loss, kind of how do we model that for the foundry business. So let's say, if I exclude the $2 billion in depreciation headwind, which I'm assuming is almost all going to your foundry business. What is the right way, Dave, to think about foundry operating income or loss this year? And how much of external foundry revenue are you expecting this year? \nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question. The operating losses will pick up. We roughly were at like 2-, 4-ish in the first quarter. It will pick up in the second quarter, given the start-up costs are increasing and I would say, be roughly in that range for the remainder of the year. And then what I said before is we see that improving then going into '25. And Pat's given me the order, he wants to see every quarter some improvement in the operating loss ultimately to get to breakeven midway through the point between now and 2030. And I think that is very achievable. Sorry, Vivek, what was the second question? \nJohn Pitzer: Vivek, are you still on? \nOperator: No, we've moved on. \nJohn Pitzer: Why don't we go to the next caller, Jonathan? \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. \nMatthew Ramsay: Yes. Pat, one question I've been getting from some folks, and I totally understand the lead times of starting some of these programs to put increased tile volume at external foundry, but you guys have made the progress on the 5 nodes in 4 years, as you highlighted multiple times. Is there any flex at all to bring back some of that external volume earlier? And I think it matters to some folks because it's a demonstration of you guys being able to ramp your own product to volume and to yield and to economics on 18A, which might give some indication to some external customers that are looking at your foundry business. So just any flex at all to pull that timeline in of sort of reshoring some of the external tiles? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Matt. And largely, those decisions are made when the product decisions are made. So there's limited flexibility to move them around. And if you pick a process node for a certain tile, generally, that's the process node that it's on. So there's limited flexibility there. And many of those decisions, as we've highlighted before, Matt were literally made years ago, right? And those choices were made. \n That said, we see the peak of our external tiles being this year and next year. And then the road map and the movement of those coming back begins to quite accelerate, even starting late next year. So the plan is clearly laid out. As we said, we see a couple of fabs' worth of capacity coming back into the Intel factory network as we move into '26 and beyond. So this becomes a significant driver. \n We've also driven significant road map decisions against that improving profile of our products. And I'll say that begins in a very powerful way next year with Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Unquestioned, the best products in clients, the best products in server are now being built on Intel 18A. And as the question suggests, we see customers seeing that. Every foundry customer that we speak to, right, understanding where we are in our product and process cycle and the ability for them to essentially benefit from Intel as customer 0 in the foundry network. \n So overall, this is feeling very good. We're on track to go accomplish that and the business model that we've laid out and Dave and I presented as we go through the decade shows a very healthy improvement in wafer ASP, wafer volume, foundry and these decisions are made, right? We're on track to both have the wafer foundry capabilities, have the process technology and the products to fill those factories. And that's why Dave and I have such confidence in the business model that we've laid out and the improvements that it will deliver as we go over the next several years together. \nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-up? \nMatthew Ramsay: Yes, John. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the AI accelerator road map. So you guys have Gaudi 3 that you talked about and Falcon Shores coming next year. And the hardware looks quite good. I wanted to ask a question about the software that goes on top of that for both -- well, really for inference but also for training. How do you feel about the software road map that you guys have in the AI space going forward? And how much compatibility, or uniqueness rather, is there to the software that runs on Gaudi 3 versus what will come on Falcon Shores and the forward road map? \nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes. Maybe 3 different points there. The first one is for inferencing, you need a whole lot less software compatibility, right? And as the market is more focused on inferencing going forward, if you can run the models, right, in the context of the databases and the other, so that portends and that's why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing right now, Matt, in these use cases. And clearly, some of the software compatibility issues of a GPU have led to the training environments that have been challenging for us. But now as customers get much more focused on enterprise use cases, inferencing TCO, we're finding a lot of strength in the offerings that we have. And as we've matured a number of customers now, we've worked through many of those use cases and getting quite a lot of acceptance of the software stack that we have with Gaudi 2 and 3. \n We will have a very smooth and seamless upgrade from Gaudi 3 into Falcon Shores. But the powerful thing that will come with Falcon Shores is the full programmability that you'll see with the complete instruction set capabilities of Falcon Shores. And at that point, we will have no deficits for any of the use cases and much greater compatibility for the full range of AI capabilities. \n The other thing that I emphasize is Xeon is a powerful capability with incredible programmable capabilities and we're finding these use cases like I described with the open platform for enterprise AI, RAG use cases is clearly beneficial there for us. So overall, we're feeling like the software story is coming together very nicely. And the entire industry is moving to higher level software abstraction such as Python and Triton. So they're moving away from any of these dependencies to an open software or platform. So the industry trends are in the right direction. Our maturity is in the right direction, and our software stack has gotten much more mature, and we'll have a very smooth upgrade to Falcon Shores. \n So let me just close our time together and say thank you for the questions. Thanks for joining our call. We appreciate the update to give you on a very solid Q1. And we got a lot done in Q1 that gives us a great foundation for the future. We continue to drive our process and products and AI innovations and delivering on our process technology and leadership road map. If any of you were at COMPUTEX in a few months, I look forward to seeing you there. We have a number of products and offerings that we'll be announcing there as we continue our AI momentum and competitiveness. And as always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gelsinger",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone. \n We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints. We continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by: one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs; two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings; and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye and Altera. \n We had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness and perhaps, most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer. We also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our road map with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. \n Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the National Semiconductor Champion along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives and loans. During the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro and Roche, among many others who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions. \n Vision went straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the open platform for enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate gen AI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or REG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. \n Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors. We are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year-to-date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company 3 years ago. Job #1 was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. \n The heart of Phase 1 was 5 nodes in 4 years. The rallying cry was toured. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our Grovian culture and execution engine and are on track to completing our 5 nodes 4-year goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception. In so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter. Furthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of the Intel 18A in these products in the first half of '25 for product release in the middle of next year. \n Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a founder relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost. This quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company. Separating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. \n This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners, we knew that the day 1 P&L for Intel foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve. I'm going to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. And you can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets. If we can move faster and do better, we will, and our new operating model is already catalyzing change in driving efficiencies across the organization. \n Let me highlight 3 important aspects of our business and our strategy that is underscored by the new model. First, with Intel products, we have exposed a solid fabless franchise with established, powerful and hard to displace installed base and ecosystem across enterprise, consumer and edge that provide meaningful benefits to our customers and partners. Intel products is a solidly profitable business today despite just recently emerging from a semiconductor downturn and still competing with legacy process technology. That is changing rapidly as we ramp Intel 3 in 2024 and Intel 18A in 2025. \n We then claim, we are defining and leading the AI PC category. IDC indicates the overall PC market is now expanding. And as stated earlier, as standards emerge and applications begin to take advantage of new AI embedded capabilities, we see demand signals improving, especially in second half of the year, helped by a likely corporate refresh. \n Our Core Ultra ramp, led by Meteor Lake, continues to accelerate beyond our original expectation, with units expected to double sequentially in Q2, limited only by our supply of wafer-level assembly. Improving second half Meteor Lake supply, and the addition of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake later this year, will allow us to ship in excess of our original 40 million AI PC CPU target in 2024. Next year, with Panther Lake, we will extend our lead with Intel 18A and further product enhancements. Our share position is strong and continues to strengthen as we execute on our product road map. Within DC AI, as committed, we have achieved product release on our first Intel 3 server product, the first-generation E-Core Xeon 6, codename Sierra Forest. \n The next-generation P-Core Xeon 6 product, Granite Rapids, will be released in Q3. At Vision, we demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Xeon 6 with good performance. We continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in 2025. While budgets are still being prioritized to generative AI build-out, where we have a strong position in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving signs for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second half. Our first Intel 18A product, Clearwater Forest, is slated to launch next year and will allow us to accelerate share gains. Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in accelerated computing for the data center and cloud. \n We now expect over $500 million in accelerated revenue in second half of 2024, with increasing momentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO as well as our own expanding supply. In addition, we are finding good traction with the Intel Developer Cloud with customers onboarding with this platform, including Dell and Zeekr, our largest IDC win to date. We are encouraged by our progress but far from satisfied. Lastly, within NEX, the business has stabilized and beat our Q1 targets with channel inventories approaching normal levels and business acceleration expected through the year as a result. We also recently announced our plans for scale up and scale out Ethernet-based AI networking delivered as a discrete NIC and chiplets for AI foundry customers with numerous key providers in the industry and market standardization through the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. \n So that is Intel products, good momentum and a lot for us to build on. Let me turn to Intel Foundry. We are executing on our strategy to drive meaningful improvement in profitability over time. We are obviously not there yet, given the large upfront investment we needed to build out this business. But we always said this was going to be a multiyear plan, and we are right on track with where we expect it to be right now. As we discussed during our webinar at the beginning of the month, the transition from pre-EUV wafers to post-EUV wafers is a powerful tailwind for us. We expect our blended average wafer pricing to grow 3x faster than cost over the decade, driving significant margin expansion. \n In addition, more competitive wafers will allow us to bring home many of the tiles that today are being manufactured at external foundries. Both dynamics are in our control and not dependent on revenue growth and are key elements to drive the business to breakeven, more than doubling our current earnings power at the Intel consolidated level. Of course, more competitive wafers combined with our position as the only company manufacturing with leading-edge wafers outside of Asia, is drawing strong interest from potential external customers. It is important to note that our leadership in advanced packaging creates more value in our wafer technologies and wafer-level assembly, and base die opportunities further fill our factories and extend the useful life of our tools for increased financial returns. \n I am pleased to announce that this quarter, we signed another meaningful customer on Intel 18A, bringing our total to 6. A leader in the aerospace and defense industry, this customer chose Intel Foundry based not only on the process technology benefits of Intel 18A, but also because of their desire to have a secure U.S.-only supply base. Just this week, we were very pleased to announce that the DoD awarded Intel Foundry Phase III of the RAMP-C program, which we are confident will lead to additional federal aerospace and defense customers. \n More broadly, we are seeing growing interest in Intel 18A and we continue to have a strong pipeline of nearly 50 test chips. The near-term interest in Intel Foundry continues to be strongest with advanced packaging, which now includes engagements with nearly every foundry customer in the industry, including 5 design awards. While we are highly focused on improving the near-term profitability of Intel Foundry, it is also important that we keep sight of the long-term opportunity here. \n The foundry market is expected to grow from $110 billion today to $240 billion by 2030, with almost 90% of the growth coming from EUV nodes and advanced packaging. Given this backdrop, we have clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030, building on our EUV High-NA process technology leadership in advanced packaging, manufacturing capacity, our systems expertise and the surge in AI demand. Put it another way, our $15 billion of external revenue embedded in our Intel Foundry target model would represent less than 15% of the leading edge foundry market. It is not a question of if but when Intel Foundry achieves escape velocity. And every day, we are proving to the market that Intel Foundry is a resilient, sustainable and trusted alternative to serve a semi market on a path to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade. \n Let me wrap up by speaking to our All Other category, where our #1 priority is to unlock shareholder value. This quarter, we formally rebranded our Programmable Solutions Group, Altera, an Intel company. We look forward to bringing in a private equity partner this year to help prepare the company for an IPO in the coming years. This puts Altera on a similar path as Mobileye. We are excited about the future of both companies. By providing them with separation and autonomy, we believe we enhance their ability to capitalize on their growth opportunities in their respective market and accelerate their path to create value. Combined with IMS, our mask writing equipment business, we believe these 3 assets represent more than 1/4 of our overall market value today. Along with a solid Intel products franchise and an Intel Foundry business rapidly approaching $100 billion in net tangible assets, we see the opportunity to unlock significant value for our shareholders as we meet our financial commitments, stand up Intel Foundry and drive it to profitability and further leverage our opportunity in AI. So overall, I'll say that there's a lot for us to build on coming out of Q1. We are systematically executing to our strategy, and we are making steady progress. We are maniacally focused on executional excellence and fiscal discipline and we are relentless in our drive to regain process leadership and bring next-generation solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. \n All of this gives me confidence in where we are headed. Yes, we have a lot of hard work in front of us, but we know what we need to do and the payoff will be significant in the end. Semiconductors are the currency that will drive the global economy for decades to come. We are one of 2, maybe 3 companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies and the only one that has Western capacity and R&D, and we will participate in the entire AI market. Quarter-by-quarter, we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. \n With that, let me turn things over to Dave. Yes. Starting out, so Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just say the market was weaker. You've seen that in a number of others that have commented as well. So I'll say somewhat across the board a bit. We've seen that, cloud customers, enterprise, across geos. So I'll just say a bit weaker demand, right, we'll just say at the low end of seasonality Q1 to Q2 that we saw. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're engaging deeply with our customers today, our OEM partners, and we just see strength across the board, right? \n Part of that is driven by our unique product position, some of it driven by the market characteristics and client, AI PC and a second half Windows upgrade cycle, we believe, underway and Core Ultra is hot. And as we said, even in Q2, we're racing -- we're meeting all of our commitments, but not all of the upside requests that we're seeing from customers. So we see a very strong AI PC outlook in the data center. As we bring in our new products, we're seeing ASPs increase very healthy on our data center products and with products like CR4 that we just went to production with this week on Intel 3, we're seeing improved product position as well for competitiveness. \n We have the $0.5 billion of Gaudi, right? And most of that is second half loaded. And the All Other businesses coming out of inventory positions in Altera and Mobileye and NEX, all of those improved first half to second half as well. And then incremental, I'll just say, Intel Foundry, every quarter from here until the decade and we're seeing improvement in the Intel Foundry. And one by one, we're seeing all of those business improvements both on revenue and margin improvements over time. So we feel very comfortable that the second half outlook is quite strong for the business, a first half a bit weaker, but we think it's very understandable, very explainable, and a second half outlook that will be very comfortable for every business across Intel growing and a lot of momentum as we go into '25. Yes. Thank you, Ben. And obviously, as we look at our position in the data center, I'll just say we're stabilizing. And with that, we're improving our competitiveness. We also see, as I mentioned in the comments, that the ASPs are going up comfortably as well. So socket fairly stable through the year, but the ASP per socket with increased core count improves our position. And then new products like Sierra Forest or Xeon Gen 6 product, definitely gives us power performance capabilities. So overall, we're seeing a very healthy growth rate, mid-20s as we go through the year. We're also seeing increasing interest in the AI capabilities of Xeon. And we're winning head node positions, and we're seeing pretty extraordinary performance at Vision. \n We talked about the ability to now run 70 billion parameter models directly on Xeon. And these type of capabilities, say, for a lot of enterprise use cases, Xeon is a very strong product. And as we laid out at Vision, the ability for Xeon plus Gaudi to start positioning this open platform for enterprise AI is a very strong position for us. So overall, we feel like we're on a solid trajectory into a market that even though it's been dominated by the gen AI theme as enterprises, our OEMs and ODMs are communicating, there's growth here in servers. And we now have a much better product position, improving ASPs and a better overall positioning in AI for a lot of these use cases where it's Xeon CPU plus GPU and accelerator. Yes. Thanks, Ben. And obviously, pipeline converting into revenue, revenue is much more meaningful and as we said, greater than $500 million for the year, and that's obviously quarter-on-quarter accelerating rapidly, which also gives a great indication for the business in '25 as well. At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their embrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. And I was super pleased to see the breadth of those customers. It was CSPs like Naver and Ola and IBM Cloud. It was ISVs like Zeekr, right, coming on board, but maybe most importantly, enterprise customers. \n And ultimately, gen AI training, okay, creating models, but enterprises are going to use models, and that's where our TCO benefits. The ability for us to action customers' data in their enterprise environment is so powerful and customers like Bosch were coming forward and Roche to be able to demonstrate the true benefits of Gaudi and Xeon plus Gaudi. The road map is in good shape. The Gaudi 3 Falcon Shores in '25. We're also seeing that the industry wants to open alternatives. And we announced our AI networking initiative, Ultra Ethernet Consortium standardizing on scale up and scale out to Ethernet, increasing work for abstract levels of AI development with PyTorch and the embrace of the open platform for enterprise AI that we rolled out. All of those taken together, the industry is looking for open enterprise alternatives for regenerative AI deployment and Intel are quite well positioned, and we're starting to really see that uptake in our Accelerator and Xeon pipeline now. Yes. So Sierra Forest, our first Xeon 6 product on Intel 3, and I'm super proud, right? Now we have a leadership process technology back on American soil for the first time in a decade. This is really exciting. And Sierra Forest, high core count, 144, 288 core product, very focused on power, performance, efficiency, and we do see a good pipeline of customers and a good pipeline of, I'll say, socket win backs because the area of power performance has been an area that we've been carrying a deficit, being on an older node. And now that we're on leadership nodes, we definitely see share gains for that. \n Of course, Granite Rapids, which will come in Q3, the Xeon 6 P-Core part is much more the bread and butter of the Xeon family. So we do see that being a stronger element to the portfolio this year as we haven't been participating in the power performance sockets as aggressively lately, and Sierra Forest gives us that tool. So it really is a one-two punch, as we've described. With Granite coming in Q3 and a volume ramp on Intel 3 with that, we feel we have a very good product line. \n Next year is Clearwater Forest, the second generation of the E-core part, the leadership position on 18A in the server market, a very strong product for us, unquestioned leadership and power performance, so I believe that's a great opportunity for us to gain share again in the data center. So the road map is healthy. The execution is strong, and we're rebuilding customer trust. They're looking at us now and saying, \"Oh, Intel is back.\" And we're quite excited by that. And then beyond that, building the volume, building the confidence and the momentum for traditional use cases as well as the AI use cases, as I just referred on Ben's question as well. Yes, Joe, thank you. And servers always just take a while to ramp. Customers bring them in, they qualify them, they test them because they're generally putting these things at scale. So there's just an adoption cycle for server products. And the numbers that I'm holding my team accountable for are some of the most aggressive volume ramps that we've ever achieved on server products. So we're driving them very hard. That said, in terms of the total wafer volume this year, right, it's dominated by Intel 7. And the Intel 4 and 3 wafer volumes become much more prominent next year, and that's what I was communicating on the webinar. \n But as we go through the year, you're going to start to see the wafer ASPs pick up as a result of Intel 4, 3 ramping at much better ASP points, better margins associated with those, and they will become much more prominent in the foundry P&L next year. But these are production ramps that are already underway on Intel 3. The Intel 4 ramp already underway. We began that second half of last year. So these wafer ramps are underway with volume productions, volume products that we're bringing to the marketplace, very confident in our ability. And then, of course, 18A as we deliver the PDK for that in Q2, the 1.0 PDK and we'll begin the volume ramps on Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake in the first half of next year for those products coming out. So we feel very comfortable with that overall picture that we've laid out. So thank you, Joe. Yes. Thanks, Vijay. I'm building a little bit on the last question. Granite Rapids will come in Q3 of this year when we'll have the production release of that product. Same as -- it just takes some time for customers to get comfortable, qualify, and bring those products to marketplace. But Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, these are much more competitive power performance products on Intel 3. So we see them stabilizing and then giving us opportunity to regain share. And as we go into next year, we expect that we're regaining share as we end this year and go into next year. These are great products and we're going to be ramping them very aggressively with our customers. Yes. And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter, extremely well received. And as I mentioned already, 20-plus customers for Gaudi 2, 3, so we're seeing that build. Obviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture, and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich -- a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PCIe card to it. This use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. Falcon Shores will just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.\n We also described customers coming on the Intel Developer Cloud, where we're getting these products very early in their life available for developers and enterprise customers. And customers like Zeekr, now our biggest Intel Developer Cloud win to date, are seeing the benefits. But the bigger story is how do we unleash the data assets of our enterprise customers, and that's things like the open platform for enterprise AI that we launched at Open Summit. So overall, a lot of good things happening to unleash the gen AI cycle for Intel. And of course, right, as we're doing this, AI is a hot market. We're participating across all of our segments, whether that's client, edge, enterprise or our foundry opportunities as well, delivering AI everywhere. Well, overall, I like to say it's hard to predict, right, exactly how these will play out in light of the overall gen AI surge that we've seen. That said, products are good, right? We came into the year improving our market share position in the first quarter of the year. It does take time to ramp these new products. But better products, rebuilding trust with our customers that we're delivering on these and now hitting the, what we would call the early end of the cycles on these new products is giving us a lot of interest with the market and the customer. New use cases also demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Granite Rapids at our Vision event, all of these just make us more and more confident in our business execution. \n We're also seeing that we don't need SoC account to increase. The ASPs are going up with the core counts on our new leadership products as well. So all of those in a fairly optimistic view that we're getting from our OEMs and our channel partners for their view of upgrade cycles, building momentum from customers across the industry. \n We feel very comfortable that we're stabilizing our position. We have been improving our road map, and we do expect to see share gains as we end the year and go into '25. Yes. Thank you. And overall, as we've seen, this is a hot product. The AI PC category, and we declared this as we finished last year, and we've just been incrementing up our AI PC or the Core Ultra product volumes throughout. We're meeting our customer commitments that we've had, but they've come back and asked for upside on multiple occasions across different submarkets. And we are racing to catch up to those upside request, and the constraint has been on the back end. Wafer-level assembly, one of the new capabilities that are part of Meteor Lake and our subsequent client products. So with that, we're working to catch up and build more wafer-level assembly capacity to meet those. \n How does it help us? Hey, it's a new category. And that new category of products will generally be at higher ASPs as your question suggests. But we also think it's new use cases, and new use cases over time create a larger TAM. It creates an upgrade cycle that we're seeing. It creates new applications, and we're seeing essentially every ISV AI-ing their app, whether it's the communications capabilities of Zoom and team for translation and contextualization, whether it's new security capabilities with CrowdStrike and others finding new ways to do security on the client or it's way other creators and gamers taking advantage of this. \n So we see that every PC is going to become an AI PC over time. And when you have that kind of cycle underway, Srini, everybody starts to say, \"Oh, how do I upgrade my platform?\" And we even demonstrated how we're using AI PC in the Intel factories now to improve yields and performance inside of our own factories. And as I've described it, it's like a Centrino moment, right, where Centrino ushered in WiFi at scale. We see the AI PC ushering in these new use cases at scale, and that's going to be great for the industry. But as the unquestioned market leader, right, the leader in the category creation, we think we're going to differentially benefit from the emergence of the AI PC. And others have commented on their inventory cycles as well in the FPGA category. We have good products in the second half of the year, with Agilex starting to ramp as well. Yes. And also in NEX, the AI networking products are strong, our IPU products, we're seeing strength in that area. So it's inventory as well as products. Even though, as your question suggests, the communication sector and the service providers, that is weaker through the year, but pretty much every aspect of their business in edge AI, as Dave said, is seeing strength as we go into the second half of the year and into '25. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. And we spoke at our Vision event about use cases like RAG, retrievable augmented generation, where the LLMs might run on an accelerator, but all of the real-time data, all of the databases, all of the embedding is running on the CPU. So you're seeing all of these data environments, which are already running on Xeon and x86 being augmented with AI capabilities to feed an LLM. And I believe this whole area of RAG becomes one of the primary use cases for enterprise AI. And if you think about it, an LLM might be trained with 1-, 2-year old data, right? But many of the business processes and environment are real time, right? \n You're not going to be retraining constantly. And that's where this area of the front-end database becomes very prominent. All of those databases run on x86 today. All of them are being enhanced for use cases like RAG. And that's why we see this unlock occurring because the data sits on-prem, the data sits in the x86 database environments that are all being enhanced against these use cases. And as we've shown, we don't need accelerators in some cases. We can run a 70 billion parameter model natively on Xeon with extraordinary TCO value for customers. And furthermore, all of the IT environments that enterprises run today, they have the security, they have the networking, they have the management technologies in place. \n They don't need to upgrade or change those from any of those use cases. So we see a lot of opportunity here to build on the enterprise asset that we have with the Xeon franchise, but we're also going to be aggressively augmenting that. And we're commonly the head node, even when it's other accelerators are being used or other GPU is being used. And as we've described, Xeon plus Gaudi, we think is going to be a very powerful opportunity for enterprises. \n So in many of those cases, we see this as a market lift, new applications, new use cases, new energy coming to the enterprise AI. Here we are in year 23 of the cloud, and while 60% of the workload has moved to the cloud, over 80% of the data remains on-prem under the control of the enterprise, much of that underutilized in businesses today. That's what gen AI is going to unlock. And a lot of that is going to happen through the x86 CPU and we see a powerful cycle emerging. And I would just point you back to what we described at Vision. This was a great event and many customers are seeing that value today. Yes. Thanks, Matt. And largely, those decisions are made when the product decisions are made. So there's limited flexibility to move them around. And if you pick a process node for a certain tile, generally, that's the process node that it's on. So there's limited flexibility there. And many of those decisions, as we've highlighted before, Matt were literally made years ago, right? And those choices were made. \n That said, we see the peak of our external tiles being this year and next year. And then the road map and the movement of those coming back begins to quite accelerate, even starting late next year. So the plan is clearly laid out. As we said, we see a couple of fabs' worth of capacity coming back into the Intel factory network as we move into '26 and beyond. So this becomes a significant driver. \n We've also driven significant road map decisions against that improving profile of our products. And I'll say that begins in a very powerful way next year with Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Unquestioned, the best products in clients, the best products in server are now being built on Intel 18A. And as the question suggests, we see customers seeing that. Every foundry customer that we speak to, right, understanding where we are in our product and process cycle and the ability for them to essentially benefit from Intel as customer 0 in the foundry network. \n So overall, this is feeling very good. We're on track to go accomplish that and the business model that we've laid out and Dave and I presented as we go through the decade shows a very healthy improvement in wafer ASP, wafer volume, foundry and these decisions are made, right? We're on track to both have the wafer foundry capabilities, have the process technology and the products to fill those factories. And that's why Dave and I have such confidence in the business model that we've laid out and the improvements that it will deliver as we go over the next several years together. Yes. Maybe 3 different points there. The first one is for inferencing, you need a whole lot less software compatibility, right? And as the market is more focused on inferencing going forward, if you can run the models, right, in the context of the databases and the other, so that portends and that's why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing right now, Matt, in these use cases. And clearly, some of the software compatibility issues of a GPU have led to the training environments that have been challenging for us. But now as customers get much more focused on enterprise use cases, inferencing TCO, we're finding a lot of strength in the offerings that we have. And as we've matured a number of customers now, we've worked through many of those use cases and getting quite a lot of acceptance of the software stack that we have with Gaudi 2 and 3. \n We will have a very smooth and seamless upgrade from Gaudi 3 into Falcon Shores. But the powerful thing that will come with Falcon Shores is the full programmability that you'll see with the complete instruction set capabilities of Falcon Shores. And at that point, we will have no deficits for any of the use cases and much greater compatibility for the full range of AI capabilities. \n The other thing that I emphasize is Xeon is a powerful capability with incredible programmable capabilities and we're finding these use cases like I described with the open platform for enterprise AI, RAG use cases is clearly beneficial there for us. So overall, we're feeling like the software story is coming together very nicely. And the entire industry is moving to higher level software abstraction such as Python and Triton. So they're moving away from any of these dependencies to an open software or platform. So the industry trends are in the right direction. Our maturity is in the right direction, and our software stack has gotten much more mature, and we'll have a very smooth upgrade to Falcon Shores. \n So let me just close our time together and say thank you for the questions. Thanks for joining our call. We appreciate the update to give you on a very solid Q1. And we got a lot done in Q1 that gives us a great foundation for the future. We continue to drive our process and products and AI innovations and delivering on our process technology and leadership road map. If any of you were at COMPUTEX in a few months, I look forward to seeing you there. We have a number of products and offerings that we'll be announcing there as we continue our AI momentum and competitiveness. And as always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much."

            "name": "David Zinsner",
            "content": "Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. \n We delivered solid results in the quarter with revenue finishing in line and gross margin and EPS, again beating guidance. Forward-looking demand signals in our core markets improved at a measured pace through the first quarter, and we expect to deliver full year revenue and EPS growth in 2024, with the pace of revenue growth accelerating in the second half. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year and just above the midpoint of our guidance, with product segments performing in line with expectations. Intel Products delivered 17% year-over-year growth, offset by inventory headwinds impacting Mobileye, Altera and our 5G customers as well as the sunsetting of several noncore lines of business including the traditional packaging business within Intel Foundry. \n These noncore revenue headwinds drove a sequential decline of just over $1 billion, in line with our Q1 guidance. Gross margin was 45.1%, 60 basis points above guidance, and EPS of $0.18 beat guidance by $0.05 on operating spending discipline and strong sell-through of previously reserved inventory. \n Q1 operating cash flow was negative $1.2 billion. Net CapEx was $5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.2 billion and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. We expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted free cash flow, driven by seasonal factors, including timing of annual bonus payments, along with upsides from larger capital offsets expected in the second half. \n As Pat mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting in the new operating segments. The revised structure creates a foundry relationship between manufacturing and our products groups with Intel Products purchasing wafers and services from Intel Foundry at fair market prices. This quarter represents another important step in our transformation, with increased transparency and accountability across all layers of the organization, which is already having a positive impact on decision-making efficiencies and financial discipline. \n As I talk about our results, I'll categorize them between Intel Products, Intel Foundry and All Other, with the All Other category, including the results of Mobileye and Altera. Additional detail can be found in our earnings release and SEC filings. Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The client business grew by more than 30% year-over-year with a strong product portfolio and share position and significantly improved customer inventory levels. The data center and AI business contributed 5% year-over-year growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. \n NEX revenue declined 8% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant declines in the 5G market, partially offset by approximately 10% year-over-year growth in our network and edge markets, which we expect to continue to recover through the year. Intel Products' operating profit expanded by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, better sell-through of reserved inventory and operating spending discipline, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 28% in the quarter. \n Intel foundry revenue was $4.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year on lower back-end services and sample revenue, along with lower IMS tool sales. In addition, wafer volume was modestly higher in the quarter, with ASPs modestly down, driven by pricing for mature nodes. Operating profit declined by approximately $100 million year-over-year, with lower revenue being partially offset by improved factory utilization. \n Op margin declined significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher start-up costs and the conclusion of the traditional packaging business impacting revenue. The foundry P&L will remain challenged through the year, and we expect operating margins to trough in 2024 as start-up costs associated with 5 nodes in 4 years peak and the P&L absorbs an expected increase of roughly $2 billion in depreciation. Beyond 2024, as volume begins to shift toward leadership manufacturing nodes with a competitive cost structure scale improves, including the return of compute tiles to internal process nodes and our efficiency actions begin to flow through the P&L, we expect to see rapid profitability improvement. \n Mobileye revenue of $239 million and an operating loss of $68 million were both down meaningfully year-over-year due to a well-publicized drawdown of iQ customer inventory. Mobileye reiterated full year guidance on their earnings call this morning. With the inventory digestion process on track, financial results are expected to recover quickly. Altera revenue was $342 million, down significantly year-over-year, with results impacted by the industry-wide inventory digestion following supply constraints in 2022 and '23. Altera's $39 million operating loss is a result of lower revenue and spending associated with standing up Altera as a stand-alone company. \n We continue to expect Altera to exit 2024 at a $2 billion revenue run rate as inventory positions normalize. I want to acknowledge the hard work and focused execution across the company to transition our systems and processes to our new reporting structure. We're already seeing the results of the increased transparency catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the company. \n Now turning to our Q2 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the second quarter, with the midpoint aligned to typical seasonal growth. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 43.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.10, all on a non-GAAP basis. We see the client and data center business roughly flat to Q1 results at the low end of seasonal. Q2 client revenue is constrained by wafer-level assembly supply, which is impacting our ability to meet demand for our Core Ultra-based AI PCs. We do expect sequential growth from Mobileye, NEX and foundry services. \n As we look beyond Q2 guidance, we expect growth across all segments in the second half of the year, led by improved demand for general purpose servers from both cloud and enterprise customers and increased core ultra assembly capacity to support a growing PC TAM, driven by enterprise refresh and the AI PC. We should also see accelerating growth from our network and edge businesses, a return to growth for Altera and a meaningful Gaudi ramp in the second half. \n Despite 2024 representing the peak for 5 node and 4-year driven factory start-up costs, we expect roughly 200 basis points of FY '24 gross margin improvement compared to FY '23. Our net capital intensity forecast of mid-30s as a percent of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate remains unchanged. With significant capital offsets expected to land in the second half of the year, we continue to expect approximately neutral 2024 adjusted free cash flow. While first half demand signals have been a bit weaker, Q1 played out largely in line with our expectations. We achieved several important milestones towards our IDM 2.0 vision, and we're participating in a large and growing TAM with encouraging market signals for the second half of the year and into 2025. By capturing margin at both the foundry level and the fabless product level, we have margin stacking advantage unique in the industry. We are 3 years into our transformation, and 2024 represents the steepest part of the climb, with 5 node and 4-year start-up cost peaking and the majority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics. However, as we crest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong wins at our back and a clear path to achieving the mid- and long-term financial targets we laid out earlier this month. \n With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Yes. Good. Thanks, Ross. Maybe start with Q1 because it somewhat explains Q2. We had better sell-through of product. I hadn't even mentioned Meteor Lake strength. That better sell-through was on previously reserved material. And so we just saw some upside in gross margins because of that. We had a little bit more of a flattish plan between Q1 and Q2 in terms of how that would flow through. And so it kind of pulled some of the benefit of gross margin improvement we would have seen in Q2 and kind of pulled it into Q1. So that was part of it. \n The second part is, as we talked about, this year was going to be a heavy year for start-up cost for us. And it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4, that will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins, helping us like, for example, Mobileye, we get good gross margin for Mobileye and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. \n As we look into '25, I think we'll have better gross margins than '25 than we had in '24. So this should be an ongoing story for us on the gross margin front. And as you know, we're driving to get to kind of mid-50s gross margins by the midpoint between now and 2030 and ultimately getting to 60%. Of course, revenue will be part of that. But a lot of that is within our control. It's things like 18A wafer pricing growing at 3x the cost of 18A that will help drive margins. The pull-in of tiles, as Pat mentioned, internally is going to drive better gross margins for us over time. All of what we're doing in terms of resegmenting new businesses to drive better decision-making, that better decision-making will translate into significant cost improvements for us, which should also be a meaningful driver for gross margins over time as well. And of course, as Pat mentioned, we're happy to get the CHIPS announcement out. And of course, that, coupled with what we expect from the EU and the investment tax credit will also be major tailwinds on gross margins over a long-term basis. Yes. Good question. So there will be additional start-up costs next year. We do think it on a percent of revenue basis, it will be lower. So that should help lift the margins. Of course, the expectation would be we see growth in revenue. That also should help. On top of that, we already are seeing good decision-making and changing decision-making around how we operate now under this new different business structure that we have at this point. A lot of that stuff doesn't actually show up in the P&L. We have all these decisions get made this year, but a lot of the decisions made -- sorry, a lot of the benefits to those decisions don't show up until next year and the year after. So we should see some benefit from that as well. \n The other thing that kind of has whipped this -- our margins around a bit over the last few years has been this notion where we reserve material all the way up until the PRQ Pat just mentioned that Sierra Forest just PRQ-ed. So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it will be more a function of revenue growth spending profile in the fabs, start-up costs that we have and the mix. Yes. On Altera, and this is not unprecedented when you see a massive work down of inventory, of course, that significantly impacts the revenue. But as that normalizes, then you start shipping to end consumption. So it's actually a pretty easy lift to get to the $2 billion mark once we're through the inventory digestion period. So I think we have high confidence on that. And then on NEX, of course, that business also has gone through its own inventory adjustment. So we have good confidence around that reversing, which will help drive strength. And then some of the products that are more tailored to the AI space, of course, we'll see like, at NEX, for example, we'll see strength through the year. And so that should drive good revenue growth through the year as well. Yes. Good question. The operating losses will pick up. We roughly were at like 2-, 4-ish in the first quarter. It will pick up in the second quarter, given the start-up costs are increasing and I would say, be roughly in that range for the remainder of the year. And then what I said before is we see that improving then going into '25. And Pat's given me the order, he wants to see every quarter some improvement in the operating loss ultimately to get to breakeven midway through the point between now and 2030. And I think that is very achievable. Sorry, Vivek, what was the second question?"
