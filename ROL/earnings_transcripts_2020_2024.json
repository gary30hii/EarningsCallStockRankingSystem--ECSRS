We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter and year end 2020 conference call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we will begin.\nJulie Bimmerman: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today.

While we faced unprecedented obstacles this past year, I\u2019m pleased to report that Rollins\u2019 performance in 2020 is marked by continued growth and solid financials. Rollins\u2019 results are a testament to the strength of our business, our exceptional focus on customer service and the commitment to program execution by our people. We are especially proud of our employees\u2019 dedication and adaptability through this difficult year. They have continued to provide vital services to our customers through very challenging situations, enabling the continuation of our long-term success. Our people are truly our most important asset as they protect our customers\u2019 property, health and peace of mind. We are extremely appreciative of their efforts during this unprecedented time. At Rollins, we also have an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe. This has never been more important than this past year, where we faced the threat of the COVID-19 virus. New stringent safety protocols were promptly created and even today remain a priority, while we continue to have employee health risk from the virus. As a result of working safely through the pandemic, we\u2019ve also benefited from the trust we have built with our customers. This was confirmed by the strong performance that we had in our residential services segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our business and the importance of the service we provided. Before I wrap up, on behalf of the entire team at Rollins, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank our two retiring directors, Jimmy Williams, he joined the Board in 1978 and Bill Dismuke, who joined the Board in 1984. Their insightful guidance and service to the company has been invaluable and we wish them well in their retirement. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide an overview of the quarter and the year. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Gary. Turning to our performance, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped off a great year in 2020. Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $536.3 million compared to $506 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year. Revenue for the full year totaled $2.161 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $2.015 billion for 2019. Net income for the full year increased to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to $203.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there are two adjustments impacting our financials. Overall, our team members in the various businesses continue to perform well. We experienced strong growth in residential pest control during the fourth quarter, increasing 11%, while termite and ancillary services grew 8.7%. Year-over-year, commercial revenue was down as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the COVID virus due to varying levels of government-driven shutdowns. However, we have continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April with fourth quarter commercial growth only 0.6% below last year. We are pleased with the steady progress we have achieved under these circumstances. I am very proud of our team and the commitment they show each day to take care of our customers. Their dedication and determination were very evident this year as they added many thousands of customers during a challenging time. We believe our fourth quarter and 2020 full year results reflect both the resilience of our company and our people. I would now like to take a moment to talk about Rollins\u2019 ESG or Environmental, Social and Governance commitment. We hold ourselves accountable to a high standard of sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate governance. ESG is not just an important part of our business it\u2019s become part of our culture. We also have launched a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative, internally focused on advancing a culture of inclusion where all employees feel respected and treated fairly with an equitable opportunity to excel. This effort is sponsored by Freeman Elliott, our Orkin U.S. President. Freeman is working in close partnership with the newly formed Advisory Council made up of employees from across all brands to drive DEI improvements. The council is actively reviewing all policies, conducting campaign awareness, creating listening forums and providing training with much more to come. We are committed to this vision in the journey we will all take together. I am also pleased to note that we have further strengthened our Board of Directors, adding to an already experienced and strong Board with the additions of Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Jerry Nix. As background, both Susan Bell and Patrick Gunning have recently retired from distinguished careers in public accounting, 36 and 39 years respectively. Both are qualified as financial experts for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public companies. Jerry Nix comes to our Board as the Former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company. They are all seasoned executives and accomplished leaders and their diverse experience will be invaluable to help shape Rollins\u2019 future. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thanks, John and good morning everybody. Although I have been with Rollins Company since 1999 and have had the opportunity over the years to interact with many of the investors on today\u2019s call, this is my first time speaking with you as Chief Operating Officer. I do so with a strong sense of responsibility to our company, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I am excited to be here. I would also like to thank all of our colleagues for the smooth transition over the last few months and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy. During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand the company\u2019s presence, not only in the U.S., but yet globally as well. We added 10 strategic acquisitions within the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore. We are very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands, and as we enter 2021, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. This past week, we completed our first virtual companywide leadership meeting with all our top leaders across all our global business units. While we missed being in the same room together, we still found an opportunity to gather on Zoom for productive discussions on items that will be critical for our success in 2021. As an example, one focus area we discussed that has been significant to our growth is mosquito service. This continues to be an excellent add-on service for many customers and has increased greater than 30% over the prior year. We know this will continue to be a great opportunity in 2021. As we have discussed in the past, mosquito-borne diseases continue to be an increasing threat around the world and as family self quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. The overall emphasis of our leadership meeting was about executing our plans in 2021, and I have great confidence in our leadership team to make this happen. Now, let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials.\nEddie Northen: Thank you, Jerry. The obstacles that impacted Q2 and Q3 continue to decrease throughout the quarter and our operations and non-operations groups continue to make tremendous adjustments to the new lives that we are all leading. We are utilizing mostly remote workforces, which has forced us to continue to evaluate processes and become more efficient. These changes have made us a better company. We are also thankful that we have invested in technology the way that we have over the last 4 to 5 years. Dealing with the increased demand on the residential side of our business and the disruption aroused on the commercial side of our business would have been an extreme challenge to handle without these tools in place. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included a fourth year in a row of metric improvement through our routing and scheduling initiatives, safety improvement that translated to expense reductions and successful continued cost containment implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP financials for the quarter and GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the full year that were impacted by accelerated investing of shares in the third quarter of this year, and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins\u2019 books in 2019. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $536.3 million was an increase of 6% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue of $506 million. Our income before income taxes was $86.9 million or 28.7% above 2019. Net income was $62.6 million, up 23.4% compared to 2019. Our EPS were $0.13 per diluted share. Looking at the full year, revenue of $2.161 billion was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year\u2019s revenue of $2.015 billion. Our GAAP income before taxes was $354.7 million or 35.8% above 2019. Our net income was $260.8 million, up 28.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 per diluted share. For the full year, looking at our non-GAAP financials, taking into account the accelerated stock vesting that occurred in the third quarter of this year and the pension plan moving off of our books in 2019, income before taxes was $361.4 million and was up 16.2% and net income was $267.5 million this year compared to $229.9 million in 2019, a 16.3% increase, and our non-GAAP EPS were $0.54 compared to $0.47, which is a 14.9% improvement. Jerry mentioned our 2021 leadership meeting, and while our gathering online instead of in-person looked different than the previous years, our focus on messaging and alignment for the year to come continue to be the same. One of the sessions over the three days was entitled, items to make you successful in 2021. During this segment, we discussed several different topics that will impact our journey of sustainability through Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG. The topics were all focused on actionable items that each and every operation can impact as we move forward in the new year. In depth, we discussed our routing and scheduling and how it saves miles, improves margin and helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Next, we discussed our launch of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative that John mentioned earlier. Freeman did an excellent job sharing how a more diverse group will help lead our decision-making in the future. And then, Jerry spent time and discussed our safety journey and how this positively impacts our workforce and our financial performance. The advantage to hosting these sessions online, and yes, I am looking for silver linings here, is that we get a chance to read comments in real-time as the speaker is leading the session. There was a very positive energy around all of these topics and others that will support our sustainability for years to come. Let\u2019s take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6% included 1.5% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.5% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 11%, commercial, excluding fumigation, commercial pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down five-tenth of a percent and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 8.7%. One item of note is that our wildlife service grew at their fastest rate since Q1 of 2018. Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4.5% and from that residential was up 9.3%, commercial ex-fumigation decreased 2.4%, and termite and ancillary grew by 8.4%. Our residential business continues to perform well and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our cost appropriately, it\u2019s difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 50.3% from 49.7% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. These gains were offset by higher materials and supplies cost related to our personal protective equipment inventory. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $203,000 to $22.4 million, a decrease of nine-tenth of a percent. Depreciation decreased $57,000 and amortization of intangible assets decreased $148,000 as intangibles from previous acquisitions such as HomeTeam and Western became fully amortized. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $159.1 million or 29.7% of revenue. This was down 2.9% compared to 2019 and the quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits and lower bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the period-ended December 31, 2020, we spent $147.4 million on acquisitions compared to $430.6 million the same period last year, which included our initial Clark Pest Control acquisition. We paid $160.5 million on dividend and had $23.2 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. These numbers all include our reduction in debt of $88.5 million for the year. As you may remember, we kicked off the reporting of our ESG activities at the beginning of the year in 2020 with our first ever 2019 Sustainability Report. In March of 2021, we will produce our second addition, which will include more updates and goals in the areas that will impact our company over the next five years. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which was a 50% increase in the pre-split numbers from last year that will be paid on March 10, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2021. Gary, I will turn the call back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: Good morning, everybody. Congrats on another nice quarter.\nGary Rollins: Thank you.\nTim Mulrooney: So, okay. Only two questions, so here we go. I\u2019m going to stick on the pricing and gross margin. So first of all, on pricing, Eddie, can you remind me just how that trended through 2020? I know a lot of folks took a pause on pricing during the pandemic. I\u2019m curious how pricing looked in 2020 and what you guys are planning or thinking about for the next pest selling season here in 2021?\nEddie Northen: Yes. Tim, we decided to \u2013 for most of our brands, to take that same pause. As you know, typically, we will roll that price increase out around mid-year. We decided based on the current economic conditions that it was not the best time to move that forward, so most of our brands did in fact take that pause. For 2021, we do have plans to move forward with a price increase. And we would be prepared as we move forward over the next quarter or two to be able to provide more details having to do with that. But we\u2019ve gone through our \u2013 we continue to go through the testing on the marketing side and we\u2019re prepared for that for 2021.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, okay. Thank you. That\u2019s broadly what we\u2019re hearing from others as well, so that makes sense. So, as I\u2019m thinking about gross margin next year \u2013 and we saw some nice gross margin expansion this year, but as I\u2019m thinking about it next year, with increases in route density from new accounts and additional M&A, plus these potential price increases, is there any reason that gross margins wouldn\u2019t be expected to continue to expand further in 2021? I guess, are there any other considerations that investors should keep in mind when thinking about your margin?\nEddie Northen: I would, believe \u2013 and I believe Jerry and John would believe the same that we will have an opportunity to expand in 2021. We have invested, as we talked in Q2 and Q3, on our inventory of protective equipment for our employees, our customer-facing employees. Our hopes would be as we move through 2021 that that would subside and that that would be somewhat of a support for us. We continue to have good, positive momentum as we talked about a couple of times, having to do with our routing and scheduling and we\u2019ll continue to see and reap the benefits of that. And I think to your point of the density, as commercial were to continue to incrementally get better as we\u2019re all hoping as we move through 2021, that density will improve and make those improvements potentially even better. So we believe, we have a few different areas that would be supportive of it in addition to what we would normally do as far as our incremental improvement on a year-over-year basis.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. Tim, this is John Wilson. And Eddie touched on a couple of things that I would have had to offer and that was the routing and scheduling in the account density piece. But related to the selling of our new accounts, you had already asked a question about the price increase that we\u2019ll roll with, we didn\u2019t see any back-up in our ability to get price for our new accounts. And so, we expect that to continue to grow for 2021 and that will help as well.\nTim Mulrooney: Understood. Thanks, John. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Northen: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi, thanks for the time. Could you maybe update us on how sustainable you think that resi growth is at these levels? As we get into 2021, obviously, there\u2019s going to be tougher comps and potentially as people head back to work with the vaccine, maybe you see a slightly less demand? I just wanted to get a sense for \u2013 if you think that could put a damper on 2021 resi growth?\nEddie Northen: So I would say a couple of things. One is that we don\u2019t know what the return to work is going to look like and you\u2019re exactly right. I mean, comping as we move throughout the year will be more difficult than what it would be during a normal year. Q1 will be a time that we\u2019ve not lapped yet as things really didn\u2019t make a change until the end of March. So Q1, I think we\u2019ll probably still see what we\u2019ve seen. As people were to return, will that reduce the demand? I think that\u2019s kind of yet to be seen at this point. The positive for us is \u2013 and Jerry talked about this is the sale of our mosquito product. As we continue to do that, that product continues to grow at a 30% plus clip on a growing base. And probably, the exciting thing for me is that we\u2019ve really expanded the opportunity for growth with this particular service to many of our different brands. So early on, we had a few of our brands that really were concentrating on this and this is really expanded to others. So we believe this is going to be a good residential opportunity for us as we move forward. But Mario, I think we\u2019re all kind of guessing right now on what that impact of the stay from home is going to look at \u2013 look like as we kind of move throughout the year.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. And then, you have actually just mentioned, and I\u2019ll piggyback off of the mosquito comment. I guess, maybe if you can talk about some of the biggest opportunities you had, it sounds like the mosquito is obviously one of them, we know about that, while we know that you guys launched the disinfectant service, would you be able to give us maybe an update on penetration on those services? And then, also, is there anything else that\u2019s in its infancy or in early innings that we should also maybe keep an eye on?\nEddie Northen: So I would say that \u2013 I made the comment about wildlife. Our wildlife continues to grow, I think the infrastructure that we put in place over the last 2 to 3 years with Steve Leavitt, leading the charge there with our emerging opportunities group has really made a positive impact for \u2013 I\u2019ll call it a nice add on. So we get those calls in our call center and now, we have a broader reach to be able to service those customers that have those types of wildlife needs. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to have opportunities there. Mosquito, we\u2019ve already talked about. In the past, we\u2019ve talked some about bed bug. Bed bug revenue is down year-over-year. Part of that is our own decision on pricing. And looking at the profitability of that compared to us putting the energy behind the mosquito product, which is a high \u2013 much higher margin product. But then I would shift over to the termite and ancillary side and say, we have continued opportunities to grow there as we have had entered the premises in a lot of cases having to do with the termite support and then providing those ancillary services in other parts of the home. And we had good growth in these areas over the last few years and I would say that will continue to be an opportunity.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. Mario, let me \u2013 this is John, let me add. The opportunity to couple multiple services with our current customer base is really pretty high. We have less than 20% of our customers that have multiple services. And so, when we can do that and we\u2019ve had good success adding mosquito, what Eddie mentioned wildlife and some other things that opportunity there is there for us in 2021 to really build on.\nMario Cortellacci: Thank you for that.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would add too, that we also had an opportunity for mosquito in the commercial sector as more and more people are eating outdoors, wanting to spend time in restaurants not being cooped up inside, we\u2019re seeing more outside. So we have opportunity on commercial to also drive mosquito business as well.\nMario Cortellacci: Thank you so much for your time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Michael, please make sure your line is not muted.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. We all have to learn about that this year, don\u2019t we? Thank you for taking the questions. What I\u2019d like to ask about is disaggregating the organic part of residential both in the quarter and for the year to understand the mix of new customer add as a proportion of 9:3 in the quarter and 8:7 for the year versus the cross-sell and that sort of ties into the comment of less than 20% of the customer base today has more than one service. I\u2019m trying to understand, how much is in the 9:3 was adding a service versus adding a customer?\nEddie Northen: So I think the way that I would answer that question is, it\u2019s kind of like the growth of our international volume as a percent to our total. We continue to add new geographies internationally, we continue to add new companies as we did most recently in Australia to our international operations, but our percent of our international to our total continues to hover around that same 7% or 8%, no matter what we do internationally, because of the growth that we have in the U.S, those numbers, they kind of stay intact. And I would just use that analogy Michael to kind of say, we\u2019re kind of doing the same thing here. So we\u2019re adding a significant number of new customers but at the same time, we are adding new services to existing customers. So as much as we continue to look for those penetration opportunities, it\u2019s a good problem to have that that number necessarily isn\u2019t improving significantly as far as those that have more than one service, because we are adding new customers each and every quarter. So we will continue once we have our foot in the door to continue to add those new services and as we\u2019ve shared on this call before, any time we have more than one service, the likelihood of that customer retaining and staying with us is significantly higher. So we\u2019ll continue to pursue that on that second or third or more services, but we\u2019re also happy on the new customer growth as well.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, I just want to ask clarification there, but I want to ask my second question to make sure I can get it in. So can you help us with cadence? So everybody appreciates the way things flowed in \u201820 in total, things we ought to be aware of as we progressed through \u201821 and you alluded to, we haven\u2019t anniversaried the negative headwinds through 1Q, but can you \u2013 without it being percentage numbers, can you help us mildly positive in one, meaningfully positive in two, and then it settles back, this is all the organic side into sort of normal course in three and four? Is that the right way to think about it?\nEddie Northen: I would say, the things that in my mind are the most impactful, and Jerry and John and Gary may have some other thoughts. The things that I would say are most impactful were Q \u2013 end of Q1, end of Q2, with our headwind of materials and supplies that occurred in 2020 that we feel will not be a headwind as we\u2019re moving through 2021 based on everything that we know today, we feel like that we have made those purchases. As we talked about in Q3, we actually had to write down our inventory because in Q2, we purchased at a very high price in some cases to be able to get that protective equipment in place, which was the right thing to do at the time and continue to move our business forward, but we feel as though that will be a good tailwind for us, especially as we move Q2, Q3, Q4. I would say on the residential side, Mario or you asked a question on what that looks like for us. Q1, we really don\u2019t have a account for that, because really things didn\u2019t go south with us there until the end of March. But I think the stay-at-home from there will continue to be at play and will continue to drive demand as well as the continued concentration on the other services that we talked about. And I would think that incrementally, we may see a little bit more of a headwind on that as we move to Q3 into Q4 of 2021. However, the offset of that would be, if things are getting back to normal and if people are going back to work that would mean that the commercial product should in fact be going the other way. The commercial product should be improving incrementally as we move Q2, into Q3, into Q4 when we look at this year-over-year. So for all those times when we had investors ask us, why we didn\u2019t concentrate only on the commercial product, and I said, I was very happy with the different products that we had to be able to sell because in diversification, I think, Michael, we\u2019re going to see a little bit of that as we move through this that yes, in fact, if stay at home does kind of subside some then the commercial should see a good improvement as we move forward. Did that help?\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, it does. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: Thanks for squeezing me back in. I just wanted to talk about M&A for a second. So if we step back and look at the full year of 2020, can you talk about \u2013 how many acquisitions did you complete in total? I\u2019m just curious if the pace was greater or lower relative to prior years given disruption from the pandemic or if that was pretty similar?\nEddie Northen: Hey, it was \u2013 I\u2019m going to let Jerry and John weigh in with any specific they have, but it was similar in nature as far as the number. Our concern, of course, the 2019 number, as I mentioned, was \u2013 would be significantly skewed with our initial Clark Pest Control purchase that we made but I think the number and even taking a look kind of generally at a spread of international and of Orkin tuck-in acquisitions and others like that, I think we\u2019re relatively in line with what we\u2019ve seen with previous years.\nJerry Gahlhoff: That\u2019s correct, Eddie. It\u2019s about flat to prior year.\nEddie Northen: Okay, alright. There we go.\nTim Mulrooney: Perfect. And you have valuations pulled back at all given all this disruption or have they all kind of been on par with what you typically see?\nJohn Wilson: Tim, this is John. They have not pulled back. There things are still pretty frothy from that side and we\u2019re kind of picking and choosing the one who will really want to go after heart as a result of that. We want to buy really good businesses with great reputation in the market and the McCall business in Jacksonville is a \u2013 the most recent example.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes. I saw that and that looks like a good one. Can I squeeze one more in for Gary?\nGary Rollins: Hey, you get one follow-up question. So there you go.\nTim Mulrooney: Excellent. Gary, this one\u2019s for you, do you still plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever the balance sheet in 2021 or does having some debt on the balance sheet make sense?\nGary Rollins: Well, I think we take on more debt if we had to with the right acquisition.\nTim Mulrooney: Sure.\nGary Rollins: I mean that\u2019s been our practice. In the past, we\u2019ve retired what \u2013 an $88.5 million just this last year. We retired $80 million of our debt, but certainly, if the right acquisitions came along, we\u2019d incur more debt, if we add to.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much guys.\nEddie Northen: I do need to clarify one thing, before we turn it over to Gary to wrap up. In my statement \u2013 in my prepared statement when I talked about our quarterly dividend increasing, I think it should have been that our quarterly dividend increased over the fourth quarter dividend that we had. So if you remember back to 2020, we actually reduced our dividend from our first quarter of 2020 down for the remainder of the year. So the improvement that I mentioned should have referenced the fact that it was compared to the Q4 dividend. So I hope that clarifies and I apologize for misstating that earlier.\nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you for letting me to follow-up. And you have to keep letting the fellas from Jefferies ask it first, then I can do the follow to him. So the M&A question I had was, can you tell us what the dollar of revenue that rolls into \u201821 from deals you did in \u201820 so we get that accurate?\nEddie Northen: We don\u2019t break that out, Mike. Yes, Mike, we don\u2019t break that out.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then, the dividend, what\u2019s it take for the dividend to go back to $0.12 a quarter, post-split?\nEddie Northen: Well, if that was the confusion, I think, partially that I just \u2013 are you saying post-split?\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. So, post \u2013 I mean if you cut it from after you\u2019d split it, it would have been $0.12. So you cut it from $0.12 to $0.08, if I\u2019ve done my math correctly. What\u2019s it take for you to return it back to $0.12?\nEddie Northen: I mean, the Board would have to review our current cash, our opportunities to be able to use that cash and then to pass back onto the shareholders. I mean, compared to where we were in Q4 and then we split our shares, it\u2019s an increase from there.\nMichael Hoffman: Right, thank you.\nGary Rollins: Alright. Do you see any other questions?\nOperator: Well, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we entered 2021 optimistic about our opportunities and look forward to updating you on our progress on our next earnings call. Thank you, again.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference.",

            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning everybody. Although I have been with Rollins Company since 1999 and have had the opportunity over the years to interact with many of the investors on today's call, this is my first time speaking with you as Chief Operating Officer. I do so with a strong sense of responsibility to our company, our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I am excited to be here. I would also like to thank all of our colleagues for the smooth transition over the last few months and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy. During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand the company's presence, not only in the U.S., but yet globally as well. We added 10 strategic acquisitions within the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and Singapore. We are very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands, and as we enter 2021, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. This past week, we completed our first virtual companywide leadership meeting with all our top leaders across all our global business units. While we missed being in the same room together, we still found an opportunity to gather on Zoom for productive discussions on items that will be critical for our success in 2021. As an example, one focus area we discussed that has been significant to our growth is mosquito service. This continues to be an excellent add-on service for many customers and has increased greater than 30% over the prior year. We know this will continue to be a great opportunity in 2021. As we have discussed in the past, mosquito-borne diseases continue to be an increasing threat around the world and as family self quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. The overall emphasis of our leadership meeting was about executing our plans in 2021, and I have great confidence in our leadership team to make this happen. Now, let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. I would add too, that we also had an opportunity for mosquito in the commercial sector as more and more people are eating outdoors, wanting to spend time in restaurants not being cooped up inside, we're seeing more outside. So we have opportunity on commercial to also drive mosquito business as well. That's correct, Eddie. It's about flat to prior year."

            "name": "John Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Turning to our performance, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped off a great year in 2020. Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $536.3 million compared to $506 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year. Revenue for the full year totaled $2.161 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $2.015 billion for 2019. Net income for the full year increased to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to $203.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the same period last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there are two adjustments impacting our financials. Overall, our team members in the various businesses continue to perform well. We experienced strong growth in residential pest control during the fourth quarter, increasing 11%, while termite and ancillary services grew 8.7%. Year-over-year, commercial revenue was down as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the COVID virus due to varying levels of government-driven shutdowns. However, we have continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April with fourth quarter commercial growth only 0.6% below last year. We are pleased with the steady progress we have achieved under these circumstances. I am very proud of our team and the commitment they show each day to take care of our customers. Their dedication and determination were very evident this year as they added many thousands of customers during a challenging time. We believe our fourth quarter and 2020 full year results reflect both the resilience of our company and our people. I would now like to take a moment to talk about Rollins' ESG or Environmental, Social and Governance commitment. We hold ourselves accountable to a high standard of sustainability, social responsibility and good corporate governance. ESG is not just an important part of our business it's become part of our culture. We also have launched a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative, internally focused on advancing a culture of inclusion where all employees feel respected and treated fairly with an equitable opportunity to excel. This effort is sponsored by Freeman Elliott, our Orkin U.S. President. Freeman is working in close partnership with the newly formed Advisory Council made up of employees from across all brands to drive DEI improvements. The council is actively reviewing all policies, conducting campaign awareness, creating listening forums and providing training with much more to come. We are committed to this vision in the journey we will all take together. I am also pleased to note that we have further strengthened our Board of Directors, adding to an already experienced and strong Board with the additions of Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Jerry Nix. As background, both Susan Bell and Patrick Gunning have recently retired from distinguished careers in public accounting, 36 and 39 years respectively. Both are qualified as financial experts for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission public companies. Jerry Nix comes to our Board as the Former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company. They are all seasoned executives and accomplished leaders and their diverse experience will be invaluable to help shape Rollins' future. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. Yes. Tim, this is John Wilson. And Eddie touched on a couple of things that I would have had to offer and that was the routing and scheduling in the account density piece. But related to the selling of our new accounts, you had already asked a question about the price increase that we'll roll with, we didn't see any back-up in our ability to get price for our new accounts. And so, we expect that to continue to grow for 2021 and that will help as well. Yes. Mario, let me \u2013 this is John, let me add. The opportunity to couple multiple services with our current customer base is really pretty high. We have less than 20% of our customers that have multiple services. And so, when we can do that and we've had good success adding mosquito, what Eddie mentioned wildlife and some other things that opportunity there is there for us in 2021 to really build on. Tim, this is John. They have not pulled back. There things are still pretty frothy from that side and we're kind of picking and choosing the one who will really want to go after heart as a result of that. We want to buy really good businesses with great reputation in the market and the McCall business in Jacksonville is a \u2013 the most recent example."

            "name": "Eddie Northen",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerry. The obstacles that impacted Q2 and Q3 continue to decrease throughout the quarter and our operations and non-operations groups continue to make tremendous adjustments to the new lives that we are all leading. We are utilizing mostly remote workforces, which has forced us to continue to evaluate processes and become more efficient. These changes have made us a better company. We are also thankful that we have invested in technology the way that we have over the last 4 to 5 years. Dealing with the increased demand on the residential side of our business and the disruption aroused on the commercial side of our business would have been an extreme challenge to handle without these tools in place. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and keys to the quarter included a fourth year in a row of metric improvement through our routing and scheduling initiatives, safety improvement that translated to expense reductions and successful continued cost containment implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP financials for the quarter and GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the full year that were impacted by accelerated investing of shares in the third quarter of this year, and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins' books in 2019. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $536.3 million was an increase of 6% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $506 million. Our income before income taxes was $86.9 million or 28.7% above 2019. Net income was $62.6 million, up 23.4% compared to 2019. Our EPS were $0.13 per diluted share. Looking at the full year, revenue of $2.161 billion was an increase of 7.2% over the prior year's revenue of $2.015 billion. Our GAAP income before taxes was $354.7 million or 35.8% above 2019. Our net income was $260.8 million, up 28.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.53 per diluted share. For the full year, looking at our non-GAAP financials, taking into account the accelerated stock vesting that occurred in the third quarter of this year and the pension plan moving off of our books in 2019, income before taxes was $361.4 million and was up 16.2% and net income was $267.5 million this year compared to $229.9 million in 2019, a 16.3% increase, and our non-GAAP EPS were $0.54 compared to $0.47, which is a 14.9% improvement. Jerry mentioned our 2021 leadership meeting, and while our gathering online instead of in-person looked different than the previous years, our focus on messaging and alignment for the year to come continue to be the same. One of the sessions over the three days was entitled, items to make you successful in 2021. During this segment, we discussed several different topics that will impact our journey of sustainability through Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG. The topics were all focused on actionable items that each and every operation can impact as we move forward in the new year. In depth, we discussed our routing and scheduling and how it saves miles, improves margin and helps to reduce our carbon footprint. Next, we discussed our launch of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or DEI initiative that John mentioned earlier. Freeman did an excellent job sharing how a more diverse group will help lead our decision-making in the future. And then, Jerry spent time and discussed our safety journey and how this positively impacts our workforce and our financial performance. The advantage to hosting these sessions online, and yes, I am looking for silver linings here, is that we get a chance to read comments in real-time as the speaker is leading the session. There was a very positive energy around all of these topics and others that will support our sustainability for years to come. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 6% included 1.5% from acquisitions and the remaining 4.5% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 45% of our revenue, was up 11%, commercial, excluding fumigation, commercial pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down five-tenth of a percent and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 8.7%. One item of note is that our wildlife service grew at their fastest rate since Q1 of 2018. Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4.5% and from that residential was up 9.3%, commercial ex-fumigation decreased 2.4%, and termite and ancillary grew by 8.4%. Our residential business continues to perform well and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our cost appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 50.3% from 49.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. These gains were offset by higher materials and supplies cost related to our personal protective equipment inventory. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter decreased $203,000 to $22.4 million, a decrease of nine-tenth of a percent. Depreciation decreased $57,000 and amortization of intangible assets decreased $148,000 as intangibles from previous acquisitions such as HomeTeam and Western became fully amortized. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $159.1 million or 29.7% of revenue. This was down 2.9% compared to 2019 and the quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits and lower bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the period-ended December 31, 2020, we spent $147.4 million on acquisitions compared to $430.6 million the same period last year, which included our initial Clark Pest Control acquisition. We paid $160.5 million on dividend and had $23.2 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $98.5 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. These numbers all include our reduction in debt of $88.5 million for the year. As you may remember, we kicked off the reporting of our ESG activities at the beginning of the year in 2020 with our first ever 2019 Sustainability Report. In March of 2021, we will produce our second addition, which will include more updates and goals in the areas that will impact our company over the next five years. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, which was a 50% increase in the pre-split numbers from last year that will be paid on March 10, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business February 10, 2021. Gary, I will turn the call back over to you. Yes. Tim, we decided to \u2013 for most of our brands, to take that same pause. As you know, typically, we will roll that price increase out around mid-year. We decided based on the current economic conditions that it was not the best time to move that forward, so most of our brands did in fact take that pause. For 2021, we do have plans to move forward with a price increase. And we would be prepared as we move forward over the next quarter or two to be able to provide more details having to do with that. But we've gone through our \u2013 we continue to go through the testing on the marketing side and we're prepared for that for 2021. I would, believe \u2013 and I believe Jerry and John would believe the same that we will have an opportunity to expand in 2021. We have invested, as we talked in Q2 and Q3, on our inventory of protective equipment for our employees, our customer-facing employees. Our hopes would be as we move through 2021 that that would subside and that that would be somewhat of a support for us. We continue to have good, positive momentum as we talked about a couple of times, having to do with our routing and scheduling and we'll continue to see and reap the benefits of that. And I think to your point of the density, as commercial were to continue to incrementally get better as we're all hoping as we move through 2021, that density will improve and make those improvements potentially even better. So we believe, we have a few different areas that would be supportive of it in addition to what we would normally do as far as our incremental improvement on a year-over-year basis. Thank you. So I would say a couple of things. One is that we don't know what the return to work is going to look like and you're exactly right. I mean, comping as we move throughout the year will be more difficult than what it would be during a normal year. Q1 will be a time that we've not lapped yet as things really didn't make a change until the end of March. So Q1, I think we'll probably still see what we've seen. As people were to return, will that reduce the demand? I think that's kind of yet to be seen at this point. The positive for us is \u2013 and Jerry talked about this is the sale of our mosquito product. As we continue to do that, that product continues to grow at a 30% plus clip on a growing base. And probably, the exciting thing for me is that we've really expanded the opportunity for growth with this particular service to many of our different brands. So early on, we had a few of our brands that really were concentrating on this and this is really expanded to others. So we believe this is going to be a good residential opportunity for us as we move forward. But Mario, I think we're all kind of guessing right now on what that impact of the stay from home is going to look at \u2013 look like as we kind of move throughout the year. So I would say that \u2013 I made the comment about wildlife. Our wildlife continues to grow, I think the infrastructure that we put in place over the last 2 to 3 years with Steve Leavitt, leading the charge there with our emerging opportunities group has really made a positive impact for \u2013 I'll call it a nice add on. So we get those calls in our call center and now, we have a broader reach to be able to service those customers that have those types of wildlife needs. So I think we're going to continue to have opportunities there. Mosquito, we've already talked about. In the past, we've talked some about bed bug. Bed bug revenue is down year-over-year. Part of that is our own decision on pricing. And looking at the profitability of that compared to us putting the energy behind the mosquito product, which is a high \u2013 much higher margin product. But then I would shift over to the termite and ancillary side and say, we have continued opportunities to grow there as we have had entered the premises in a lot of cases having to do with the termite support and then providing those ancillary services in other parts of the home. And we had good growth in these areas over the last few years and I would say that will continue to be an opportunity. So I think the way that I would answer that question is, it's kind of like the growth of our international volume as a percent to our total. We continue to add new geographies internationally, we continue to add new companies as we did most recently in Australia to our international operations, but our percent of our international to our total continues to hover around that same 7% or 8%, no matter what we do internationally, because of the growth that we have in the U.S, those numbers, they kind of stay intact. And I would just use that analogy Michael to kind of say, we're kind of doing the same thing here. So we're adding a significant number of new customers but at the same time, we are adding new services to existing customers. So as much as we continue to look for those penetration opportunities, it's a good problem to have that that number necessarily isn't improving significantly as far as those that have more than one service, because we are adding new customers each and every quarter. So we will continue once we have our foot in the door to continue to add those new services and as we've shared on this call before, any time we have more than one service, the likelihood of that customer retaining and staying with us is significantly higher. So we'll continue to pursue that on that second or third or more services, but we're also happy on the new customer growth as well. I would say, the things that in my mind are the most impactful, and Jerry and John and Gary may have some other thoughts. The things that I would say are most impactful were Q \u2013 end of Q1, end of Q2, with our headwind of materials and supplies that occurred in 2020 that we feel will not be a headwind as we're moving through 2021 based on everything that we know today, we feel like that we have made those purchases. As we talked about in Q3, we actually had to write down our inventory because in Q2, we purchased at a very high price in some cases to be able to get that protective equipment in place, which was the right thing to do at the time and continue to move our business forward, but we feel as though that will be a good tailwind for us, especially as we move Q2, Q3, Q4. I would say on the residential side, Mario or you asked a question on what that looks like for us. Q1, we really don't have a account for that, because really things didn't go south with us there until the end of March. But I think the stay-at-home from there will continue to be at play and will continue to drive demand as well as the continued concentration on the other services that we talked about. And I would think that incrementally, we may see a little bit more of a headwind on that as we move to Q3 into Q4 of 2021. However, the offset of that would be, if things are getting back to normal and if people are going back to work that would mean that the commercial product should in fact be going the other way. The commercial product should be improving incrementally as we move Q2, into Q3, into Q4 when we look at this year-over-year. So for all those times when we had investors ask us, why we didn't concentrate only on the commercial product, and I said, I was very happy with the different products that we had to be able to sell because in diversification, I think, Michael, we're going to see a little bit of that as we move through this that yes, in fact, if stay at home does kind of subside some then the commercial should see a good improvement as we move forward. Did that help? Hey, it was \u2013 I'm going to let Jerry and John weigh in with any specific they have, but it was similar in nature as far as the number. Our concern, of course, the 2019 number, as I mentioned, was \u2013 would be significantly skewed with our initial Clark Pest Control purchase that we made but I think the number and even taking a look kind of generally at a spread of international and of Orkin tuck-in acquisitions and others like that, I think we're relatively in line with what we've seen with previous years. Okay, alright. There we go. I do need to clarify one thing, before we turn it over to Gary to wrap up. In my statement \u2013 in my prepared statement when I talked about our quarterly dividend increasing, I think it should have been that our quarterly dividend increased over the fourth quarter dividend that we had. So if you remember back to 2020, we actually reduced our dividend from our first quarter of 2020 down for the remainder of the year. So the improvement that I mentioned should have referenced the fact that it was compared to the Q4 dividend. So I hope that clarifies and I apologize for misstating that earlier. We don't break that out, Mike. Yes, Mike, we don't break that out. Well, if that was the confusion, I think, partially that I just \u2013 are you saying post-split? I mean, the Board would have to review our current cash, our opportunities to be able to use that cash and then to pass back onto the shareholders. I mean, compared to where we were in Q4 and then we split our shares, it's an increase from there."

Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer and then we will begin. Thank you, Julie. While we faced unprecedented obstacles this past year, I'm pleased to report that Rollins' performance in 2020 is marked by continued growth and solid financials. Rollins' results are a testament to the strength of our business, our exceptional focus on customer service and the commitment to program execution by our people. We are especially proud of our employees' dedication and adaptability through this difficult year. They have continued to provide vital services to our customers through very challenging situations, enabling the continuation of our long-term success. Our people are truly our most important asset as they protect our customers' property, health and peace of mind. We are extremely appreciative of their efforts during this unprecedented time. At Rollins, we also have an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe. This has never been more important than this past year, where we faced the threat of the COVID-19 virus. New stringent safety protocols were promptly created and even today remain a priority, while we continue to have employee health risk from the virus. As a result of working safely through the pandemic, we've also benefited from the trust we have built with our customers. This was confirmed by the strong performance that we had in our residential services segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our business and the importance of the service we provided. Before I wrap up, on behalf of the entire team at Rollins, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our two retiring directors, Jimmy Williams, he joined the Board in 1978 and Bill Dismuke, who joined the Board in 1984. Their insightful guidance and service to the company has been invaluable and we wish them well in their retirement. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide an overview of the quarter and the year. John? Thank you, Eddie. We are happy to take your questions at this time. Thank you. Hey, you get one follow-up question. So there you go. Well, I think we take on more debt if we had to with the right acquisition. I mean that's been our practice. In the past, we've retired what \u2013 an $88.5 million just this last year. We retired $80 million of our debt, but certainly, if the right acquisitions came along, we'd incur more debt, if we add to. Alright. Do you see any other questions? Okay. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we entered 2021 optimistic about our opportunities and look forward to updating you on our progress on our next earnings call. Thank you, again."

Looking at our third quarter performance, we were pleased to report another solid result. And we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to 79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as they were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first nine months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first nine months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our nine-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. Turning to our business lines results, residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic tool. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter and for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. Overall, our people and business continue to perform well and what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset and we're grateful for their efforts. Further our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard trust and confidence that our customers have in us. Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, as many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing [indiscernible] and strategic initiatives over the years. His promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins, President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pest control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He's successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam pest defense, Clark pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest, and OPC Services, as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, it's direction and it's future. We look forward to their continued contributions. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Gary. I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to be here. I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. While the Coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter, and how we're executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid, our call centers are busy and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged, yet at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we've been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as third quarter progressed and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time, have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. Still, we are by no way thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment, and with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We're executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees, as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer facing employees, we're continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective and quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we're pleased with a very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out west, as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now we have not had any significant business disruption. I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brand, which has experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include life trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America. And looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all. He is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years, improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. I'll now turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Northen: Thank you, John. I believe at every reference it could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. In 2016, we held our first ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing over the time and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them had been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization, and as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside and our operations and non-operations groups had make tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insights to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E. And the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins book in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million, or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before tax was 115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman\u2019s Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for the vesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pensions divesting were non-cash items, Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year, compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. Looking at the first nine months revenue of $1.625 billion that was an increase of 7.6% of the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% of 2019. Net income was 198.2 million up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our gap earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration were income before taxes of $274.5 million up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the nine months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million one-time charge to revalue our inventory. With the pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense for Q2 of 2021. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenues increased 4.9% that included 1.4% from acquisition and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which is a small portion of that but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue was up 10.5% commercial ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down 1.9% and termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that residential was up 9%. Commercial ex-fumigation decreased 3.7% and termite ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well and the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic, with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses, as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as I referenced related to the inventory, revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased 714,000 to $22.4 million an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased 286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased 838,000 or five tenths of a percent to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent 79.9 million on acquisition compared to 431.2 million the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had 17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash of which 62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives such as Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local community. In 2021, our employee volunteered goals include community cleanup efforts, trafficking, education awareness, literacy programs and support of the United Way to name a few. Rollins has committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a three for two stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020 for stockholders a record at the close of business, November 10, 2020. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Well, thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Mulrooney: Good morning to Gary, my condolences once again to you and your family on the passing of your brother.\nGary Rollins: Thank you.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes. Just a few questions this morning. On the last conference call, Eddie, you mentioned that you hit 10 out of 10 record new sales days in June and July. Now, how did your new sales trend through August and September does it remain elevated or did you see a return to more normalized sales patterns as you exited that peak selling season?\nEddie Northen: Yes, Tim. Thanks. Yes, we didn't highlight that today. And I don't know if we necessarily duplicated that that number that we had shared before. But I think based on what we reported as far as the revenue gains, you can see that they were elevated especially on the residential side. And our call center did the much higher activity, has seen in previous years, even as we started to come out of the season and move into some cooler areas, as we've seen. Again, the majority of that was on the residential side. But we have seen incremental improvements on the commercial side as well, for some of the smaller businesses that would come through our call center for that.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. On the margins, EBITDA margins were particularly strong this quarter, nearly 24%. Is there any way for you to quantify for us how much of this is from the temporary cost cuts that you implemented earlier this year? I'm trying to figure out how much of this expansion in margin we've seen recently a structural from your routing and scheduling, for example, versus how much of this is more of a temporary dynamic?\nEddie Northen: Well, there's no question that routing and scheduling is paying great dividends for us now, especially as we're having to have technicians potentially adjust and change some routes that they maybe would have historically run on both sides, on the residential as we're growing gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year, stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which is positive. And I think those types of things to the point of your question are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed, as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back, had been brought back at this point in time. And I think that our both our operations and our non-operations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways as many organizations have to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. So I don't have a defined answer and exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth we'll get a more and better and clear answer to that. The good news is from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted, even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side, come back into the business.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. And what I think you pretty much did answer\u2026\nOperator: Excuse me, this the operator only two questions per participant, and then you can reenter the question queue after that. The next question is from Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nSeth Weber: And I'd also like to extend my condolences to everybody there. I want to ask about the commercial business. You mentioned that trends improved sequentially month-to-month. And I was just wondering, I think you said for the quarter, organic was down about 3.7. Can you just talk about, did it end up with September in positive territory in the commercial side? Or is that still trending negative through September? Thanks.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. I think we're still negative. We have a few different operations that have some heavy concentration in areas that are the most impacted right now. And we have a heavy concentration in New York City area, those of you that are there around that area know and understand the impact of what's going on there. But we're definitely seeing improvements in other areas that have been an opportunity to open back up and as businesses have been able to make those decisions. And our sales group continues to do a good job looking and working on those verticals, where we know that there's less impact. On the healthcare side and on logistics and those things like that, they continue to do a nice job, but in those areas. So positive improvements, but I wouldn't say that we're positive quite yet.\nSeth Weber: Okay. And then, a follow up on that, I think I heard in some of the SG&A discussion that bad debt expense actually got better. Can you just talk about your collection efforts and what kind of trends you're seeing on the commercial side with respect to any kind of customer pain or just extensions that are happening on the commercial side specifically on the collections? Thanks.\nEddie Northen: On the collection side, on the residential side is where we saw our improvements that occurred. And those were in our larger brands and if you think about our larger brands that are going to have residential bases -- large residential bases, our Orkin brand or HomeTeam brands, our Clark brand, all have larger residential bases. And we were able to see improvements there. On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle, we made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2 with our customers that we made the decision to do that with, we really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high profile bankruptcies that you read about that we read about a lot of those, in cases, our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year, so well before the pandemic occurred, as they were on our watch list, we were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower but on the residential side with a positive impact.\nOperator: We have a question from Mario Cortellacci, Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.\nMario Cortellacci: I'd also like to send my condolences to all of you and Gary and your family. I'm very sorry for your loss. My question is around the disinfecting business and specifically in commercial. I guess, could you give us a sense of what kind of uptick you're seeing there, how much uptake you're seeing from customers. And the reason why I'm asking is just to understand how much of the improvement in revenue and on the commercial side has been this offset from the disinfectant business versus having customers come back, either coming back, or increasing the amount of service that they're getting.\nEddie Northen: I'm sure John's going to have some comments that he'd like to add. But I would say if you look at those two categories, it would be more weighted towards customers coming back. But the disinfectant, the new services, in many of our brands has been a positive impact for us to be able to go through and add on the revenue side. What we see from the disinfectant side, customers that have had some sort of incident occur, that need to ensure that they have this taken care of and the cleanliness in their workplace, either for their customers or for their employees those are the ones that we have a shorter sales cycle for, and that one need to get something in place. Others that know, this is the right thing to do, but aren't necessarily under that same pressure, we had a little bit of a longer sales cycle. And we're learning as we continue to move forward. But it continues to grow for us. But I would say if you had to differentiate between those two, that we've had more incremental business that has come back.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. You're exactly right, the impact from that of -- in Orkin, we call it bottle cleaner, various brands have different names that they're calling it as they go to market. But the impact of the gap for commercial revenue to a year ago is very small from bottle clean, most of it has been from customers returning to services, their needs change.\nEddie Northen: We don't have a lot of view of things that are kind of outside of our area where we are, as we know, most of us aren't traveling these days. We just know what our view is here in Georgia. And a lot of things have opened back up and are more close to what we knew before. And you contrast that with something like the New York City area where it is significantly different than what it was like before. So it's those pockets that are seeing those incremental improvements, that we're able to see customers come back and we're able to continue to be able to service them.\nGary Rollins: Could I add one thing, Eddie? We're very fortunate that that in most of our commercial accounts hospitality related, health related they can put the service off indefinitely. They know that the best will come back, the way they got started to begin with receiving merchandise from outside and so forth. So that's a positive thing that we're disappointed when they differ a service. But our experience has been is they will be back. And I think, our numbers have showing that.\nMario Cortellacci: Thank you. And then, just on M&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mr. Michael Hoffman. Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much. And like my colleagues, we wish your family the best, Gary.\nGary Rollins: Thank you.\nMichael Hoffman: Two questions I have are focused on organic growth and then on margins. On the organic growth side. we're noticing across the Stifel coverage broadly, that work from home is having interesting, positive -- mostly positive consequences. I point to like Pentair reported extraordinary pool numbers, and so on and so forth. Can you disaggregate the 9% and help us understand how much is being influenced by people all at home and so they're ordering maybe adding mosquito and tick and or that you spoke to the wildlife number, versus its net new customer ads, so we can understand the influence? And then what are your thoughts about how that starts to anniversary?\nEddie Northen: Yes. Thank you, Michael. We don't break out customers and things like that, I will tell you that we have had great new customer growth. But I can't really -- I don't know really know exactly, how much of this is being driven by someone at home that is adding the mosquito versus that they would want the mosquito. Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30% plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base of what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now, as far as, when it comes down to [indiscernible], can't answer that either just because we just don't know. We don't know that people continue to work from home, where we have situations where there's an additional need for more services. We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher, because, as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase and [indiscernible] it in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there. So, big customer growth and probably the best that we can say at this point.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. On the margin side between gross margins and then as a cost to SG&A. So the gross margin came down 100 basis points sequentially, which makes sense if you're bringing back furloughed people. We flushed out the sort of that returning a people issue. And then on the SG&A side, you clearly have shown a lot of discipline in the management of that in an absolute dollar basis, as well as percent of revenue. How much of that is annual accrual things that will come back versus is permanent?\nEddie Northen: I will take the first part of your question, I think we've pretty much moved through all the furloughed process that we had just a very small number, that would still be -- we could be making decisions on but I think Q2 we saw the majority that Q3. It's kind of moved through. On the structural side on the SG&A, like I was answering earlier, we're leaner than we were when we went into this. We did have some positive impact that impacted through our bad debt. But we also saw very strong improvements in our administrative salaries, as well as our personnel related. So structurally on the people side, I think Q2 and Q3 we're seeing kind of similar trends there. And, we use technology to be able to make us better and be able to make us more efficient as we're moving forward.\nOperator: We have a further question from Mr. Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead sir.\nTim Mulrooney: Hey, thanks for taking my next question. Eddie, I just wanted to follow up on your previous answer to me. The way you said that one of your greatest improvements and reduction of miles driven was this quarter. Is that due to anything that you're -- I guess doing differently or are your branches just becoming more mature? On the VRM system, I guess maybe I'm just looking for a general update on where you're at with your tech initiatives and rollout?\nEddie Northen: Yes. So yes, I would say two things and John's got something to add as well. I think two things to say. One maturity continues to move forward in time. As we continue to have retention of our technicians that's going to be a positive thing for us. But we had these four stages of routing and scheduling. And we're in this -- we're kind of in this phase two of this four stage and as we continue to layer on additional technology pieces that are kind of behind the scenes for the operation, that's going to continue to drive improvements. So I would say improvements will continue to be positive as we're moving forward.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. I will add two things, Eddie, and the first one is very similar, but greater adoption, Tim, no doubt with our branch operations. But then also greater density with huge amount of residential customers, we've added commercial coming back. We just have greater density on our routes.\nGary Rollins: One other thing that we had to look forward too, we did not have all of our brands on our routing and scheduling.\nEddie Northen: That's right.\nGary Rollins: So we've got I guess what we're converting now \u2013 \nJohn Wilson: [Indiscernible] converted, and then we have other brands that we're adding as well. But, yes you're right, as we talk about this four phases, that's exactly.\nGary Rollins: That's always a good time. If you have the people that want it, they adapt it so much quicker than a normal situation. You have to convince them.\nEndof Q&A:\nOperator: Gary?\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better, improve our customers experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update with our fourth quarter call in the future. Thanks again.",

            "content": "Yes. Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. And actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, John. I believe at every reference it could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. In 2016, we held our first ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing over the time and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them had been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization, and as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside and our operations and non-operations groups had make tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insights to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E. And the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvement year-over-year. As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins book in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million, or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before tax was 115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for the vesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pensions divesting were non-cash items, Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year, compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. Looking at the first nine months revenue of $1.625 billion that was an increase of 7.6% of the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% of 2019. Net income was 198.2 million up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our gap earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration were income before taxes of $274.5 million up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the nine months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million one-time charge to revalue our inventory. With the pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense for Q2 of 2021. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenues increased 4.9% that included 1.4% from acquisition and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which is a small portion of that but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue was up 10.5% commercial ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue was down 1.9% and termite and ancillary services which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that residential was up 9%. Commercial ex-fumigation decreased 3.7% and termite ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well and the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic, with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses, as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as I referenced related to the inventory, revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased 714,000 to $22.4 million an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased 286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased 838,000 or five tenths of a percent to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent 79.9 million on acquisition compared to 431.2 million the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had 17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash of which 62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives such as Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local community. In 2021, our employee volunteered goals include community cleanup efforts, trafficking, education awareness, literacy programs and support of the United Way to name a few. Rollins has committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share, plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a three for two stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020 for stockholders a record at the close of business, November 10, 2020. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Yes, Tim. Thanks. Yes, we didn't highlight that today. And I don't know if we necessarily duplicated that that number that we had shared before. But I think based on what we reported as far as the revenue gains, you can see that they were elevated especially on the residential side. And our call center did the much higher activity, has seen in previous years, even as we started to come out of the season and move into some cooler areas, as we've seen. Again, the majority of that was on the residential side. But we have seen incremental improvements on the commercial side as well, for some of the smaller businesses that would come through our call center for that. Well, there's no question that routing and scheduling is paying great dividends for us now, especially as we're having to have technicians potentially adjust and change some routes that they maybe would have historically run on both sides, on the residential as we're growing gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year, stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which is positive. And I think those types of things to the point of your question are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed, as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back, had been brought back at this point in time. And I think that our both our operations and our non-operations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways as many organizations have to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. So I don't have a defined answer and exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth we'll get a more and better and clear answer to that. The good news is from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted, even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side, come back into the business. On the collection side, on the residential side is where we saw our improvements that occurred. And those were in our larger brands and if you think about our larger brands that are going to have residential bases -- large residential bases, our Orkin brand or HomeTeam brands, our Clark brand, all have larger residential bases. And we were able to see improvements there. On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle, we made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2 with our customers that we made the decision to do that with, we really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high profile bankruptcies that you read about that we read about a lot of those, in cases, our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year, so well before the pandemic occurred, as they were on our watch list, we were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower but on the residential side with a positive impact. I'm sure John's going to have some comments that he'd like to add. But I would say if you look at those two categories, it would be more weighted towards customers coming back. But the disinfectant, the new services, in many of our brands has been a positive impact for us to be able to go through and add on the revenue side. What we see from the disinfectant side, customers that have had some sort of incident occur, that need to ensure that they have this taken care of and the cleanliness in their workplace, either for their customers or for their employees those are the ones that we have a shorter sales cycle for, and that one need to get something in place. Others that know, this is the right thing to do, but aren't necessarily under that same pressure, we had a little bit of a longer sales cycle. And we're learning as we continue to move forward. But it continues to grow for us. But I would say if you had to differentiate between those two, that we've had more incremental business that has come back. We don't have a lot of view of things that are kind of outside of our area where we are, as we know, most of us aren't traveling these days. We just know what our view is here in Georgia. And a lot of things have opened back up and are more close to what we knew before. And you contrast that with something like the New York City area where it is significantly different than what it was like before. So it's those pockets that are seeing those incremental improvements, that we're able to see customers come back and we're able to continue to be able to service them. Yes. Thank you, Michael. We don't break out customers and things like that, I will tell you that we have had great new customer growth. But I can't really -- I don't know really know exactly, how much of this is being driven by someone at home that is adding the mosquito versus that they would want the mosquito. Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30% plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base of what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now, as far as, when it comes down to [indiscernible], can't answer that either just because we just don't know. We don't know that people continue to work from home, where we have situations where there's an additional need for more services. We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher, because, as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase and [indiscernible] it in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there. So, big customer growth and probably the best that we can say at this point. I will take the first part of your question, I think we've pretty much moved through all the furloughed process that we had just a very small number, that would still be -- we could be making decisions on but I think Q2 we saw the majority that Q3. It's kind of moved through. On the structural side on the SG&A, like I was answering earlier, we're leaner than we were when we went into this. We did have some positive impact that impacted through our bad debt. But we also saw very strong improvements in our administrative salaries, as well as our personnel related. So structurally on the people side, I think Q2 and Q3 we're seeing kind of similar trends there. And, we use technology to be able to make us better and be able to make us more efficient as we're moving forward. Yes. So yes, I would say two things and John's got something to add as well. I think two things to say. One maturity continues to move forward in time. As we continue to have retention of our technicians that's going to be a positive thing for us. But we had these four stages of routing and scheduling. And we're in this -- we're kind of in this phase two of this four stage and as we continue to layer on additional technology pieces that are kind of behind the scenes for the operation, that's going to continue to drive improvements. So I would say improvements will continue to be positive as we're moving forward. That's right."

            "name": "John Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to be here. I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. While the Coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter, and how we're executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid, our call centers are busy and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged, yet at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we've been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as third quarter progressed and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time, have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. Still, we are by no way thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment, and with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We're executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees, as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer facing employees, we're continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective and quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we're pleased with a very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out west, as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now we have not had any significant business disruption. I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brand, which has experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include life trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America. And looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all. He is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years, improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. I'll now turn the call over to Eddie. Yes. I think we're still negative. We have a few different operations that have some heavy concentration in areas that are the most impacted right now. And we have a heavy concentration in New York City area, those of you that are there around that area know and understand the impact of what's going on there. But we're definitely seeing improvements in other areas that have been an opportunity to open back up and as businesses have been able to make those decisions. And our sales group continues to do a good job looking and working on those verticals, where we know that there's less impact. On the healthcare side and on logistics and those things like that, they continue to do a nice job, but in those areas. So positive improvements, but I wouldn't say that we're positive quite yet. Yes. You're exactly right, the impact from that of -- in Orkin, we call it bottle cleaner, various brands have different names that they're calling it as they go to market. But the impact of the gap for commercial revenue to a year ago is very small from bottle clean, most of it has been from customers returning to services, their needs change. Yes. I will add two things, Eddie, and the first one is very similar, but greater adoption, Tim, no doubt with our branch operations. But then also greater density with huge amount of residential customers, we've added commercial coming back. We just have greater density on our routes. [Indiscernible] converted, and then we have other brands that we're adding as well. But, yes you're right, as we talk about this four phases, that's exactly."

            "name": "Gary Rollins",
            "content": "Yes, Joe. Thank you. Good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our third quarter 2020 conference call. Before turning the call over to Eddie to read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer. First, I want to take a moment to recognize the recent passing of our former Chairman and my brother Randall Rollins. Randall was an extraordinary human being and his accomplishments and contributions made at the various Rollins public and private companies over the years are unequal. He is missed greatly, not only by our family and his friends, but also by generations of Rollins employees and colleagues who he respected so highly. Many of you reached out with condolences upon receiving the news of his death. And I'd like to thank you for having our family in your thoughts, as well as for your kind words. Eddie, would you please read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer? Thank you, Eddie. Looking at our third quarter performance, we were pleased to report another solid result. And we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to 79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as they were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first nine months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first nine months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our nine-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. Turning to our business lines results, residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic tool. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter and for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. Overall, our people and business continue to perform well and what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset and we're grateful for their efforts. Further our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard trust and confidence that our customers have in us. Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, as many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing [indiscernible] and strategic initiatives over the years. His promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins, President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pest control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He's successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam pest defense, Clark pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest, and OPC Services, as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, it's direction and it's future. We look forward to their continued contributions. Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John? Well, thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Thank you. Could I add one thing, Eddie? We're very fortunate that that in most of our commercial accounts hospitality related, health related they can put the service off indefinitely. They know that the best will come back, the way they got started to begin with receiving merchandise from outside and so forth. So that's a positive thing that we're disappointed when they differ a service. But our experience has been is they will be back. And I think, our numbers have showing that. Thank you. One other thing that we had to look forward too, we did not have all of our brands on our routing and scheduling. So we've got I guess what we're converting now \u2013 That's always a good time. If you have the people that want it, they adapt it so much quicker than a normal situation. You have to convince them. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better, improve our customers experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update with our fourth quarter call in the future. Thanks again."

We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2020 conference Call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin.\nPaul Northen: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today.

Before talking about our results, I want to express how concerned and focused we are regarding the spread of COVID-19. We know many of you are experiencing the expansion of the virus in your communities, and we hope you and your family are doing well and remain safe. Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 17.2% to $75.4 million or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase. Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers. During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely. Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates. Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Gary, and good morning. I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do. As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals. As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity. Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced. Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas. In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses. I will now turn the call over to Eddie.\nPaul Northen: Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt. Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter. The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019. As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights. In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic. Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTimothy Mulrooney: Congrats on a nice quarter in these difficult times.\nPaul Northen: Thank you, for that.\nTimothy Mulrooney: Given how much is going on lately, I have plenty of questions about the quarter, but something else came up recently that I wanted to get your perspective on. So here it goes. A major lawn care provider recently announced that they're getting into the residential exterior pest services. Given how well residential pest has held up during the pandemic, are you seeing that more often other service providers encroaching into the pest control space? Do you view this as a competitive threat? Are you not concerned? Any thoughts you have on this issue would be greatly appreciated.\nPaul Northen: Yes. So I guess what I would say is that we've seen through the years, and Gary can share his 50-plus years of what he's seen getting in and out of this space over time, residential continues to grow at a very hefty rate. But at the same time, it's a very fragmented market, as you know. We have a very healthy market share and other large players also have a very healthy market share. But there are a lot of other regional and mom-and-pop players that are part of this market as well. I know John has had some interaction with different companies as well. So John, I don't know if you want to share something and maybe Gary share what you've seen in the past.\nJohn Wilson: Yes, sure. Thank you, Eddie. Tim, we've seen sort of an evolution with TruGreen as their noncompete with Terminix has sort of expired, go from lawn to offering tick-and-flea services to mosquito to now what their offering is, is essentially outdoor residential pest control, outdoor only. And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services. So while it certainly bears watching, it's a tough sled. So we'll see what they do.\nGary Rollins: Many of you may know that we were like the number three lawn care company in the country. And we had the decision kind of moving in the other way. Just felt like the lawn care business would be under more scrutiny, the fact that more regulatory pressures were existing. And we just didn't see the growth pattern and margin pattern equaling pest control. So what we did is when we got out of the business, we just ramped up our acquisitions and ramped up the speed in our revenue. It's going to be a challenge for them to do. Well, they say nothing's hard for the guy that doesn't have to do it. That may apply to us, Eddie, but we welcome them. Anytime a competitor comes in that has big prices, it just makes our job easier.\nTimothy Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you for that perspective, everybody. That's very helpful. As my follow-up, I'll ask one question about commercial pest. Gary, you mentioned something that I thought was interesting. You said you're narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Is another way for me to interpret that is to say, as you move through the quarter, the declines became smaller each month? So April was down the most, May was down less, June was down less, and July is down even less than June. Am I reading that right?\nPaul Northen: Tim, I'll start, and I'll let Gary share, obviously, what he wants to say. But I mean, we're really going to be the mirror of the economy in general. So I think in March going into early April is when the majority of the economy was completely shut down. And I think as you saw pockets begin to open up and you began to see commerce and hiring began and some of the stimulus checks get into people's hands, I think that made people make different decisions on things. And I think you've kind of seen the ebb and flow, of course, of that as some things are starting to kind of tighten up again. But I think incrementally, as things got a little bit better and a little better, we saw that on the commercial side as well. Do you want to say anything else on that?\nGary Rollins: Yes, I would. Just for a minute. We -- as I said before, we've been in the business. We think that there's different growth patterns in lawn care than in pest control. But we -- what we're seeing is more of our commercial accounts, especially in the food-related industries realize that they can't defer their pest control indefinitely. And that's one of the motivations of them coming back. Because they've had an experience typically of large infestations and that's one of the things. They cannot do without pest control indefinitely. And they've got health department attention naturally. And so we really think that -- we see them coming back, but we think they'll continue to come back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.\nEmily McLaughlin: This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth this morning. My first question is on the margins. They were clearly very strong this quarter. Can you frame for us how much that reflected the temporary cost actions? And what will come back with volumes as they improve? And I know you called out routing and scheduling enhancements as a benefit. Any way to quantify that?\nPaul Northen: I would say a couple of things. One, if this event had to occur -- if the virus had to occur, the pandemic had to occur, from a business standpoint, it was the best possible time for us as an organization. We had not hired for our peak season. We were just starting into that at that point in time. So it enabled us to really be able to go through and quickly align the payroll side as best we could. And then John and team as well as here in our home office, we made some difficult decisions and made some cuts to be able to go through and be prepared. So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint. And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we're appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that we'll be -- that we'll have a clear focus on. And John and team across all the brands have done that. And of course, the commercial operations have been the most impacted, our brands that are predominantly commercial. But we have a lot of brands that have both residential and commercial, in a lot of cases, termite.\nJohn Wilson: Emily, if I may add. We got a pretty good indicator over the last 2 weeks of March that our commercial business is going to be most heavily impacted and -- whereas residential in our termite business was going to remain strong. So our people were able to laser in on the commercial side of that business and then -- and react very, very quickly. And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintained them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play.\nEmily McLaughlin: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on VitalClean. I know it's still early days, but is there any way to think about the revenue and the margin contribution in the quarter? And what the take rate of that offering is with the clients that are reopening? And if it's helping you win new customers?\nPaul Northen: So we're not going to break that out. We don't break any other pieces out like that. I'll say that what we are seeing -- we're pleased with the growth that we've seen in a short period of time. What we're seeing is a couple of different things. One, if customers have some sort of incident at their locations, they're typically much more open to quickly move forward and get that in place. And then as other places are fully ramping up, so restaurants instead of being takeout and delivery now having seat -- inside seating. Those are the types of places where we've seen much more of a need. And as the economy continues to move in that direction, I think we'll see good opportunities. But it's been a great cross-sell for us. John and team, again, hats off. We're able to get the product launched, to get the salespeople trained, to get technicians fully trained and for our procurement group to get the product into the hands of our folks in a very short period of time has been very positive. So it's another trust point for our customers that we allow them to be able to run their business by us supporting them and it just takes one more worry off of their plate, having to deal with this whole situation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: I wanted to drill a little further into the commercial business. And just, I guess, what you're seeing from commercial customers right now? Have you seen any bankruptcies from that business that could potentially impair a part of it? Obviously, I know you have the disinfectant business that is going to offset some of the lost revenue there, and hopefully the commercial comes back. But I just wanted to see, I guess, what do you expect longer term? Is there going to be a partial impairment of the commercial business longer term? And obviously, you'll gain some new commercial customers as the economy rebound, but would love to get your thoughts there.\nPaul Northen: Well, I don't think anybody has the full crystal ball on exactly what the economy is going to look like for Q3, Q4 moving into next year. I think there's no question that there will be bankruptcies that will come out of this. We've seen some of those already. We have the same headlines that you have, having to do with major franchise groups that have gone bankrupt, restaurant chains, some retail stores and things like that when you don't have foot traffic and you're shutting down, of course, they're having to deal with everything dealing with that. So we're dealing with that. We're staying close to those customers. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have set aside a reserve for what we feel is appropriate based predominantly on our commercial customers. And that's really where we're seeing the impact at this point. Residential, we're not seeing an impact at this time, having to do with the concern with that. But we're staying close to those large customers to try to help mitigate whatever we can and also work with our long-term customers that we've had relationships with. We want to help them to survive this as best we can, and we're going to work with them as appropriate. But then we'll take the needed steps from there.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. And then just one more, and I'll turn it over. Obviously, you guys have had great strength in residential, and congratulations on that. But I guess just -- I think that's obviously being driven from the work-from-home dynamics. But I guess, just are you seeing anything little deeper down below the surface that we're not seeing? Is there anything that could be causing maybe a shift or a step-up in the long-term trajectory of the residential growth rate?\nPaul Northen: I would point to two things. I would point to, one, the continued growth of our mosquito product. If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period.  So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there.\nGary Rollins: Eddie, if I could add one thing. We've been investing quite heavily in technology. And one of those areas, in particular, is provide the customer more ways that they can pay us. And before we had the quarterly customer and they paid at the end of the previous quarter. And now they can pay by monthly. So there's other ways that they can pay, and that's been highly acceptable. And I think Eddie made a real good comment about, if our customer has multiple services, and we call it bundling, so typically that starts when they're sold. And that's helped a lot as far as customer satisfaction is concerned.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: I appreciate the time. I'd like to try and thread in some of the previous questions and maybe tease out a little bit of clarity, and somehow ask 2 questions and turn into 10, right? Gary, your comment about VitalClean is -- I think what you were trying to say is even if I'm not open yet, I know I'm going to be, I better start the pest service because it's -- you're getting in positions. That was the point. Not VitalClean, I meant the -- well, that's part of VitalClean. But is that part of your comment about commercial, is that some are even doing the pest service even though they're not opening yet, but they expect to be open, that was part of what you were indicating? Because of the...\nGary Rollins: Well, the part of that VitalClean is taking place right now is more and more companies are coming back. And they've read about the dangers. They know more about the dangers of the virus and so forth. And they also, from a PR point -- HR point of view, they want to be able to tell their employees what they're doing to maintain good health practices. So that's been a wonderful factor as far as this past quarter, and it will be beyond. I mean if the experts are ready and are correct, then we should be seeing a continuation of this group of customers.\nMichael Hoffman: And some customers restarted pest without being back open again because of your infestation comment?\nPaul Northen: Yes. I think that's what we've seen as the time has gone by is that...\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's what I was trying to understand better. Okay. And then on June 30, you all filed a 13D with regards to the original trust and dissolve that trust and there's a distribution. Are those distributions done? Are there any restrictions on those shares with regards to how they can be traded or not or can -- having redistributed all those shares, are those individual smaller trusts now allowed to do whatever they want with the shares?\nPaul Northen: Mike, there was no material change. This has been updated multiple times throughout the years and just an update that was needed for the most recent setup that they have.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, but that didn't answer the question about trading restrictions on the shares.\nPaul Northen: I did say that if you go back and read it, that I did say that there were no material changes. This was just an update that they've done periodically over time.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor over to Gary for closing comments.\nGary Rollins: Thank you. I want to thank you for participating. We still -- unfortunately, there's more that we don't know than we do know. I think most of you will agree in just following the monthly dialogue and the spike and various components that are impacting the disease and -- but we meet weekly or every other weekly, our key management people, to evaluate the success that we're having in different aspects of our defensive and offensive policy. And I didn't know you're going to quote more on there's more known than unknown...\nPaul Northen: All right. It's so good. I have borrow it.\nGary Rollins: I'm the copyright person here. But thank you for your support during these challenging times and look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Thank you, again.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt.

EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019. As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year.

This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights.

And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we're appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that we'll be -- that we'll have a clear focus on. And John and team across all the brands have done that. And of course, the commercial operations have been the most impacted, our brands that are predominantly commercial. But we have a lot of brands that have both residential and commercial, in a lot of cases, termite. So we're not going to break that out. We don't break any other pieces out like that. I'll say that what we are seeing -- we're pleased with the growth that we've seen in a short period of time. What we're seeing is a couple of different things. One, if customers have some sort of incident at their locations, they're typically much more open to quickly move forward and get that in place. And then as other places are fully ramping up, so restaurants instead of being takeout and delivery now having seat -- inside seating. Those are the types of places where we've seen much more of a need. And as the economy continues to move in that direction, I think we'll see good opportunities. But it's been a great cross-sell for us. John and team, again, hats off. We're able to get the product launched, to get the salespeople trained, to get technicians fully trained and for our procurement group to get the product into the hands of our folks in a very short period of time has been very positive. So it's another trust point for our customers that we allow them to be able to run their business by us supporting them and it just takes one more worry off of their plate, having to deal with this whole situation. Well, I don't think anybody has the full crystal ball on exactly what the economy is going to look like for Q3, Q4 moving into next year. I think there's no question that there will be bankruptcies that will come out of this. We've seen some of those already. We have the same headlines that you have, having to do with major franchise groups that have gone bankrupt, restaurant chains, some retail stores and things like that when you don't have foot traffic and you're shutting down, of course, they're having to deal with everything dealing with that. So we're dealing with that. We're staying close to those customers. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have set aside a reserve for what we feel is appropriate based predominantly on our commercial customers. And that's really where we're seeing the impact at this point. Residential, we're not seeing an impact at this time, having to do with the concern with that. But we're staying close to those large customers to try to help mitigate whatever we can and also work with our long-term customers that we've had relationships with. We want to help them to survive this as best we can, and we're going to work with them as appropriate. But then we'll take the needed steps from there. I would point to two things. I would point to, one, the continued growth of our mosquito product. If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period.  So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there. Yes. I think that's what we've seen as the time has gone by is that... Mike, there was no material change. This has been updated multiple times throughout the years and just an update that was needed for the most recent setup that they have. I did say that if you go back and read it, that I did say that there were no material changes. This was just an update that they've done periodically over time. All right. It's so good. I have borrow it."

            "name": "John Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good morning. I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do. As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals. As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity. Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced. Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas. In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses. I will now turn the call over to Eddie. Yes, sure. Thank you, Eddie. Tim, we've seen sort of an evolution with TruGreen as their noncompete with Terminix has sort of expired, go from lawn to offering tick-and-flea services to mosquito to now what their offering is, is essentially outdoor residential pest control, outdoor only. And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services. So while it certainly bears watching, it's a tough sled. So we'll see what they do. Emily, if I may add. We got a pretty good indicator over the last 2 weeks of March that our commercial business is going to be most heavily impacted and -- whereas residential in our termite business was going to remain strong. So our people were able to laser in on the commercial side of that business and then -- and react very, very quickly. And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintained them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play."

            "name": "Gary Rollins",
            "content": "Yes, Marilynn. Thank you, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2020 conference Call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Thank you, Eddie. Before talking about our results, I want to express how concerned and focused we are regarding the spread of COVID-19. We know many of you are experiencing the expansion of the virus in your communities, and we hope you and your family are doing well and remain safe. Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 17.2% to $75.4 million or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase. Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers. During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely. Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates. Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John? Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Many of you may know that we were like the number three lawn care company in the country. And we had the decision kind of moving in the other way. Just felt like the lawn care business would be under more scrutiny, the fact that more regulatory pressures were existing. And we just didn't see the growth pattern and margin pattern equaling pest control. So what we did is when we got out of the business, we just ramped up our acquisitions and ramped up the speed in our revenue. It's going to be a challenge for them to do. Well, they say nothing's hard for the guy that doesn't have to do it. That may apply to us, Eddie, but we welcome them. Anytime a competitor comes in that has big prices, it just makes our job easier. Yes, I would. Just for a minute. We -- as I said before, we've been in the business. We think that there's different growth patterns in lawn care than in pest control. But we -- what we're seeing is more of our commercial accounts, especially in the food-related industries realize that they can't defer their pest control indefinitely. And that's one of the motivations of them coming back. Because they've had an experience typically of large infestations and that's one of the things. They cannot do without pest control indefinitely. And they've got health department attention naturally. And so we really think that -- we see them coming back, but we think they'll continue to come back. Eddie, if I could add one thing. We've been investing quite heavily in technology. And one of those areas, in particular, is provide the customer more ways that they can pay us. And before we had the quarterly customer and they paid at the end of the previous quarter. And now they can pay by monthly. So there's other ways that they can pay, and that's been highly acceptable. And I think Eddie made a real good comment about, if our customer has multiple services, and we call it bundling, so typically that starts when they're sold. And that's helped a lot as far as customer satisfaction is concerned. Well, the part of that VitalClean is taking place right now is more and more companies are coming back. And they've read about the dangers. They know more about the dangers of the virus and so forth. And they also, from a PR point -- HR point of view, they want to be able to tell their employees what they're doing to maintain good health practices. So that's been a wonderful factor as far as this past quarter, and it will be beyond. I mean if the experts are ready and are correct, then we should be seeing a continuation of this group of customers. Thank you. I want to thank you for participating. We still -- unfortunately, there's more that we don't know than we do know. I think most of you will agree in just following the monthly dialogue and the spike and various components that are impacting the disease and -- but we meet weekly or every other weekly, our key management people, to evaluate the success that we're having in different aspects of our defensive and offensive policy. And I didn't know you're going to quote more on there's more known than unknown... I'm the copyright person here. But thank you for your support during these challenging times and look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Thank you, again."

Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin?\nGary Rollins: Yes, Marilyn. Thank you and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2020 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin.\nEddie Northen: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2019 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Eddie. We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008 as the closest example that we've had. But from my perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifaceted, found ourselves in unchartered waters. Prior to the last two weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shutdown early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest hit state, New York, and other states shutdown randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final two weeks to adjust for the revenue drop. Revenues for the first quarter though grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year. On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, residential up 18.6%, commercial pest control rose 8%, and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%. Couple of other bright spots during the quarter, mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw record-setting growth in that business line. We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double-digits over last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly. You're entering what is traditionally the high pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive and with termite, it's too early to judge the season. Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality, retail, restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in healthcare, food processing, logistics and grocery. The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We're pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress a number of serious pathogens that could endanger their employees and customers. The VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service. Our company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of a pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This will be across the nation as regions, states, counties, and cities begin to open up. The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly. Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibilities seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the public's well-being is an important assignment. I'll now turn the call over to John for more details.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees, and customers. Our people on the front-lines of this pandemic have performed heroically taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines. Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly. Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers, and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing. The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front-line. To help ensure this, we have provided a companywide increase to our paid time-off program for all full and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or has been quarantined for suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need while protecting their health and the safety of those around them. Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves, and in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected. Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Front-line team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken. As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free. Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademarked as VitalClean uses an EPA registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or lists and that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous surfaces. We are very excited about the potential for this service for both our existing and potential customers. And now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Northen: Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insights as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insights to what we know today. Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers, as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together. As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers. As Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue, and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment or PPE for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups at the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included higher material costs and supplies as mentioned with the personal protective equipment, the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service Orkin VitalClean and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2. Looking any of the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million, an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million, or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lock Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes depreciation of $1.4 million mostly due to buildings and added vehicles, amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million, and interest expense of $2.4 million. As we've mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These two items along with the transition to new more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year. Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue was up 8%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double-digits. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial ex-fumigation increased 2.1%, and termite and ancillary grew 11%. There are two items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past six years. In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. But moving the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million, or 32.4% of revenues, down one-tenth of a percentage point from $139.5 million, or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease as the percent of revenue and the percent of revenue was primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects. Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus, and this step along with the others that we have taken will further prepare us to come out of this time and even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter. As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions, compared to $7 million at the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The two other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll, and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue. Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Cost of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters. Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent to revenue by about one tenth of a percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean with early winds around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada. As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pest services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well-positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed. Finally, the Board of Directors approved the temporary reduction through our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 11th, 2020. Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMario Cortellacci: Thank you. Hi, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. Just -- I think the most important thing for investors to derive in what the exit rates were at the end of March. And just wondering if you can give us more color and then if you can quantify what you saw organic growth for resi and commercial at the end of March and then how that's trended throughout April? Do you think that we've bottomed at this point? And just what do you see, I guess, where you can expect possibly the rest of the quarter? Obviously we don't know, but just based out of April trends?\nGary Rollins: Yes. Mario, I hate to punt on the first question out. That's really difficult. We have -- on the residential side, which we put in our press release, we're still seeing good demand. On the commercial side, we know what customers have been impacted on the commercial side. We've suspended some customers or they suspended us because of not having a need. And the reason why I'm pumping on the question is because we don't know of those ones that have suspended. We don't know which ones of those customers will be coming back. We have a feeling for the larger customers which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about those mom and pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situation. So, it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well. But residential, we're definitely seeing the most positive, and we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like.\nMario Cortellacci: Okay. And then, even during, say, the exit in March, you can share any color on that?\nGary Rollins: Well, you look at the end of March and then you look at what that flowed into April. So, by the end of March, New York was shutdown, California was shutdown, a few other major states were shut down, but then you had other states that were beginning that shutdown process or shutdown portions of what they had going on. So, I just don't think that it's going to be fair for us to be able to even share that because I don't really know what that's going to look like. I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have a bowling alleys open, but we also have restaurants -- we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here and I said, okay, how many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since we've opened back up, and no one raised their hand. So, we just don't really know what the impact is going to be even as we're opening back up and what the impact is going to be longer term for these businesses to be able to stay in business.\nMario Cortellacci: Got you. Okay. And then just one more and I'll turn it over. On the disinfectant business, actually it's a very interesting idea, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of share some of the success that you might have seen, I think -- I've heard that you think the more success in Europe versus the U.S. in the early on days and probably with COVID hit over there versus the U.S. earlier. But what do you think that business looks like longer-term? I mean, just as people tend to have a very short memory, I mean, does this business accelerate in a year from now or do you think because people tend to be short-minded that maybe they forget about the COVID situation and they tell, I don't need this service anymore, and then maybe doesn't gain as much traction or have as much relevance maybe a year or two for now, just what your take on that?\nGary Rollins: Well, before 9/11, we could always walk through an airport and we could just go get on a plane. And then after 9/11, that changed for all of us, forever probably. And I don't think we know exactly what the outcome of this will be at this point in time. I think in the near-term, I think all of the things we've seen from the different states that are opening up have some form of a recommendation of the cleanliness. And so, we're trying to go through and talk about what makes sense for the verticals, where to spend our time from a sales perspective with that. Some are going to need that just to be able to get customer back in the door and feel comfortable. Now, what I think the question that we don't know is, what's going to be mandated as we move forward in time as far as cleanliness.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. This is John Wilson, by the way, if I may add. I think Eddie hit the nail in the head with the mandated portion. I think there'll be certain industries, maybe hospitals, healthcare, food processing that it may well be mandated, some others that it's strongly recommended by the various government entities, health department, maybe most especially. So, it's hard to say, but I do think it can be fairly significant for us where the early returns is terrific in terms of what our people are managing to add to their customers with.\nMario Cortellacci: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTim Mulrooney: Good morning, everybody.\nGary Rollins: Good morning, Tim.\nEddie Northen: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Can you shed some light on your end market exposure in the commercial parts business? I understand you don't want to give any insight into the growth rates through April, but what would help me and others maybe model because we have to model something, right? Specifically, I'm curious what percent of your commercial business is restaurants and hotels, which are likely under significant pressure right now?\nEddie Northen: Yes, we've never broken that out. We're not going to break that out by vertical, and a lot of that's just going to be from a competitive standpoint. We don't want to put ourselves in the crosshairs of other competitors being able to step into the areas, but we have a good strong cross-section of all the different verticals. And if you'll go back to previous calls that we've had having to do with this topic, we've talked a lot about moving into the verticals such as -- or moving more strongly into verticals such as healthcare, such as food processing, such as logistics, and we've talked about that over the past couple of years. So, we've had a strong concentration in those areas. But there's no question that we have a very strong cross-section of all those different ones as well as a decent amount of large customers with a large performance of small and medium-sized customers as well.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, Eddie. Okay. That -- I understand. You don't want to disclose that for competitive reasons. Any vertical, I'm just trying to get something that can help us if any vertical more than 25% of your commercial business or can you tell us that no vertical is more than X percent of your business?  Any color that way where you're not really disclosing much of anything for competitive reasons but gives investors assurance that you're not over-weighted in any particular end market?\nEddie Northen: I think your last statement is spot on. We were not over-weighted in any individual vertical that is out there. We have a relatively diversified set of verticals and have percentages in those relatively diversified as well.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Because I read an article recently from specialty consultants, which does market sizing. I think in there, it said something like 40% of the commercial business is restaurants. So, it's fair to say that your end market mix does not necessarily match that of the broader market?\nGary Rollins: Your statement is correct. And I would -- I would be interested to understand the data behind what you read there. That's what I understand about, about what's out there in the industry. But your statements correct.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, cool. Thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber : Hi. Good morning. Hope everybody's well. I guess maybe a question for Eddie. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on the collection side? Are you seeing customers delay payments? Are you doing anything to kind of ensure just the quality of your receivables or anything like that? And then I just had a follow-up on the M&A comment. Thanks.\nEddie Northen: Yes. So we shored up our reserves a little bit on that side, just to make sure, we do have a pretty healthy diversified customer base as well, we really concentrated on higher income to be able to not only sell a product that sell more than one product. And we're seeing that band -- or income band of customers not being as impacted from a collection standpoint. So I think it's still a little bit too early to be able to say one way or another on that, you know, we're just three or four weeks into the unemployment checks and people still having, you know, relatively, relatively full income. But we're being a little bit cautious with that and we're being a little bit aggressive, putting more resources into that area, just to do the best that we can at this point.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Thanks. And then just going back to your comment on -- \nEddie Northen: Just one more thing, just one more thing with that, you may or may not know, there are certain states that have put mandates in place where you are not allowed to collect, and those there.\nSeth Weber: Right.\nEddie Northen: So you probably already know about all those and we're complying as we should for all of those states.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Thank you. And then just following up on your, your M&A comment, can you just characterize and valuation started to come down across the group here, over the last couple months relative to where they were?\nEddie Northen: I would say the number of sellers are much less than what we've seen in previous times. And I would say that valuations for those that are still in the market are probably coming down as well, with other with less other players in the market. Some of our direct competitors have said publicly that they are not in the market. And, you know, while we're not necessarily aggressively going out there and looking we're absolutely being, open and opportunistic.\nGary Rollins : Yes, I would agree with all of those statements. I do see valuations maybe coming down a bit, because just simply -- because there aren't as many buyers in the market at least right now.\nSeth Weber: Okay. It's very interesting. Thank you. Thank you guys, appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hi. Thank you all for taking the questions and I'm glad everybody is safe and you all have done the right thing by your employees. Can I ask a clarification question first, if I may? I'm scribbling the numbers down as fast as I could when you're talking, but when you said $18 million to $22 million cost containment, is that an annualized number or that's the quarter savings?\nEddie Northen: That's for the quarter. That's for the quarter. And that's going to include some of the categories that John talked about having to do with payroll. We really didn't go into a lot of the details on the discretionary cuts that we've made, but that would include those two categories, discretionary and payroll.\nMichael Hoffman: So, just so I'm clear. If I took the high end of materials and furloughs, and PTO, I mean, that's kind of $4 million, so I got $4 million headwind and I got an $18 million offset.\nGary Rollins: If that's just the math -- yes. I don't have that -- that's transcribed.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, good. All right then. I just want to make sure I understood right. My question-question -- it's two parts, trying to stay in the spirit of one question. Residential lead generation is okay, and when this lead starts, do you think you would get calls from commercial, let's say, hey, I'm going to restart, come in and do a -- I'll call it an added service, so there's a restart service kind of activity?\nGary Rollins: Yes. I'm sure John can weigh in with a lot more specifics to that, but I'll just start by saying. I think we see customers in a few different buckets. One is, they're doing normal -- their normal service that they would have, either because they are fully in business or they're in some sort of partial business. I think we have another bucket that it completely stops at this point in time, because they don't have anything at all going on. And I think we have a third bucket, which is kind of a hybrid which let's just say they maybe received a service once a week, they might now be receiving a service every other week or every three weeks just to keep things relatively intact at this point. So, we've got -- by customer, we're trying to accommodate as best as makes sense for them, especially for those that know they're going to be opening up relatively soon, they don't want to make a decision that they're going to open up on, let's just say, May 1st, they haven't done anything for four weeks and now they have an infestation that they have to go through and deal with. They don't want to have that situation. So, I think those are kind of the buckets of what we're seeing by the customers.\nJohn Wilson: And Michael, we've seen a wide array of tactics by our customers to maybe defray costs. Some have chosen to suspend altogether, some have chosen to reduce frequency, and some have continued with their service even though they may be shut down knowing that they don't want an outbreak of pest problem. We've had one of our big retailers that had put us on suspend that's already notified us for to re-begin or begin service in May. So, I would suspect that we will have quite a few that as we're coming back on, we'll get us in there before they open.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's what I thought, given a little pop from that and then back on to a normal trend.\nJohn Wilson: That makes sense.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nMarilyn Meek: Okay. No other questions?\nGary Rollins: Okay. No other question. I'd like to add a comment, and that's -- we were so uncomfortable with these we don't know answers as I'm sure you all are hearing them. But I think that we have responded quickly. I think that we have three wonderful areas of increasing our business with our termite season, our mosquito season, and with the VitalClean. So -- and again, it is challenging to try to determine how big can VitalClean be. The first 30 days have been very encouraging, and our residential pest control leads have continued to be strong. So, you have so many variables, it's just really difficult to gauge all these, but I think one of the reasons that we took status with our dividend was that we just want to be prepared for the future. And those of you that have followed the company for some time know that we're generally conservative, and I think that we're in a best position of anybody in the industry to deal with this. So, we're just going to keep working at it and improving, and hopefully we'll see this turn in the near future. Saying that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us, we appreciate your interest in our company. On our behalf, we hope that you and your family and friends remain safe and well, and we look forward to updating you on our second quarter call. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eddie Northen",
            "content": "Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the risk factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2019 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insights as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insights to what we know today. Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers, as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together. As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers. As Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue, and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment or PPE for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups at the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included higher material costs and supplies as mentioned with the personal protective equipment, the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service Orkin VitalClean and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2. Looking any of the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million, an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million, or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lock Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes depreciation of $1.4 million mostly due to buildings and added vehicles, amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million, and interest expense of $2.4 million. As we've mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These two items along with the transition to new more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year. Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue was up 8%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double-digits. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial ex-fumigation increased 2.1%, and termite and ancillary grew 11%. There are two items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past six years. In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. But moving the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million, or 32.4% of revenues, down one-tenth of a percentage point from $139.5 million, or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease as the percent of revenue and the percent of revenue was primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects. Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus, and this step along with the others that we have taken will further prepare us to come out of this time and even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter. As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions, compared to $7 million at the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The two other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll, and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue. Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Cost of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters. Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent to revenue by about one tenth of a percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean with early winds around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada. As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pest services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well-positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed. Finally, the Board of Directors approved the temporary reduction through our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 11th, 2020. Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you. Good morning, Tim. Yes, we've never broken that out. We're not going to break that out by vertical, and a lot of that's just going to be from a competitive standpoint. We don't want to put ourselves in the crosshairs of other competitors being able to step into the areas, but we have a good strong cross-section of all the different verticals. And if you'll go back to previous calls that we've had having to do with this topic, we've talked a lot about moving into the verticals such as -- or moving more strongly into verticals such as healthcare, such as food processing, such as logistics, and we've talked about that over the past couple of years. So, we've had a strong concentration in those areas. But there's no question that we have a very strong cross-section of all those different ones as well as a decent amount of large customers with a large performance of small and medium-sized customers as well. I think your last statement is spot on. We were not over-weighted in any individual vertical that is out there. We have a relatively diversified set of verticals and have percentages in those relatively diversified as well. Yes. So we shored up our reserves a little bit on that side, just to make sure, we do have a pretty healthy diversified customer base as well, we really concentrated on higher income to be able to not only sell a product that sell more than one product.

            "content": "Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees, and customers. Our people on the front-lines of this pandemic have performed heroically taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines. Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly. Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers, and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing. The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front-line. To help ensure this, we have provided a companywide increase to our paid time-off program for all full and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or has been quarantined for suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need while protecting their health and the safety of those around them. Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves, and in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected. Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Front-line team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken. As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free. Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademarked as VitalClean uses an EPA registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or lists and that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous surfaces. We are very excited about the potential for this service for both our existing and potential customers. And now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie. Yes. This is John Wilson, by the way, if I may add. I think Eddie hit the nail in the head with the mandated portion. I think there'll be certain industries, maybe hospitals, healthcare, food processing that it may well be mandated, some others that it's strongly recommended by the various government entities, health department, maybe most especially. So, it's hard to say, but I do think it can be fairly significant for us where the early returns is terrific in terms of what our people are managing to add to their customers with. And Michael, we've seen a wide array of tactics by our customers to maybe defray costs. Some have chosen to suspend altogether, some have chosen to reduce frequency, and some have continued with their service even though they may be shut down knowing that they don't want an outbreak of pest problem. We've had one of our big retailers that had put us on suspend that's already notified us for to re-begin or begin service in May. So, I would suspect that we will have quite a few that as we're coming back on, we'll get us in there before they open. That makes sense. Yes. Thank you."

            "name": "Gary Rollins",
            "content": "Yes, Marilyn. Thank you and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2020 conference call. Eddie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Thank you, Eddie. We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008 as the closest example that we've had. But from my perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifaceted, found ourselves in unchartered waters. Prior to the last two weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shutdown early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest hit state, New York, and other states shutdown randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final two weeks to adjust for the revenue drop. Revenues for the first quarter though grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year. On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, residential up 18.6%, commercial pest control rose 8%, and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%. Couple of other bright spots during the quarter, mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw record-setting growth in that business line. We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double-digits over last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly. You're entering what is traditionally the high pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive and with termite, it's too early to judge the season. Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality, retail, restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in healthcare, food processing, logistics and grocery. The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We're pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress a number of serious pathogens that could endanger their employees and customers. The VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service. Our company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of a pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This will be across the nation as regions, states, counties, and cities begin to open up. The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly. Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibilities seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the public's well-being is an important assignment. I'll now turn the call over to John for more details. Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. Yes. Mario, I hate to punt on the first question out. That's really difficult. We have -- on the residential side, which we put in our press release, we're still seeing good demand. On the commercial side, we know what customers have been impacted on the commercial side. We've suspended some customers or they suspended us because of not having a need. And the reason why I'm pumping on the question is because we don't know of those ones that have suspended. We don't know which ones of those customers will be coming back. We have a feeling for the larger customers which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about those mom and pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situation. So, it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well. But residential, we're definitely seeing the most positive, and we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like. Well, you look at the end of March and then you look at what that flowed into April. So, by the end of March, New York was shutdown, California was shutdown, a few other major states were shut down, but then you had other states that were beginning that shutdown process or shutdown portions of what they had going on. So, I just don't think that it's going to be fair for us to be able to even share that because I don't really know what that's going to look like. I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have a bowling alleys open, but we also have restaurants -- we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here and I said, okay, how many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since we've opened back up, and no one raised their hand. So, we just don't really know what the impact is going to be even as we're opening back up and what the impact is going to be longer term for these businesses to be able to stay in business. Well, before 9/11, we could always walk through an airport and we could just go get on a plane. And then after 9/11, that changed for all of us, forever probably. And I don't think we know exactly what the outcome of this will be at this point in time. I think in the near-term, I think all of the things we've seen from the different states that are opening up have some form of a recommendation of the cleanliness. And so, we're trying to go through and talk about what makes sense for the verticals, where to spend our time from a sales perspective with that. Some are going to need that just to be able to get customer back in the door and feel comfortable. Now, what I think the question that we don't know is, what's going to be mandated as we move forward in time as far as cleanliness. Good morning, Tim. Your statement is correct. And I would -- I would be interested to understand the data behind what you read there. That's what I understand about, about what's out there in the industry. But your statements correct. Okay. Thanks. Yes, I would agree with all of those statements. I do see valuations maybe coming down a bit, because just simply -- because there aren't as many buyers in the market at least right now. If that's just the math -- yes. I don't have that -- that's transcribed. Yes. I'm sure John can weigh in with a lot more specifics to that, but I'll just start by saying. I think we see customers in a few different buckets. One is, they're doing normal -- their normal service that they would have, either because they are fully in business or they're in some sort of partial business. I think we have another bucket that it completely stops at this point in time, because they don't have anything at all going on. And I think we have a third bucket, which is kind of a hybrid which let's just say they maybe received a service once a week, they might now be receiving a service every other week or every three weeks just to keep things relatively intact at this point. So, we've got -- by customer, we're trying to accommodate as best as makes sense for them, especially for those that know they're going to be opening up relatively soon, they don't want to make a decision that they're going to open up on, let's just say, May 1st, they haven't done anything for four weeks and now they have an infestation that they have to go through and deal with. They don't want to have that situation. So, I think those are kind of the buckets of what we're seeing by the customers. Okay. No other question. I'd like to add a comment, and that's -- we were so uncomfortable with these we don't know answers as I'm sure you all are hearing them. But I think that we have responded quickly. I think that we have three wonderful areas of increasing our business with our termite season, our mosquito season, and with the VitalClean. So -- and again, it is challenging to try to determine how big can VitalClean be. The first 30 days have been very encouraging, and our residential pest control leads have continued to be strong. So, you have so many variables, it's just really difficult to gauge all these, but I think one of the reasons that we took status with our dividend was that we just want to be prepared for the future. And those of you that have followed the company for some time know that we're generally conservative, and I think that we're in a best position of anybody in the industry to deal with this. So, we're just going to keep working at it and improving, and hopefully we'll see this turn in the near future. Saying that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us, we appreciate your interest in our company. On our behalf, we hope that you and your family and friends remain safe and well, and we look forward to updating you on our second quarter call. Thank you."

On the line with me today and speaking are John Wilson, Vice Chairman; Jerry Gahlhoff, Jr., President and Chief Operating Officer; and Julie Bimmerman, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin?\nGary Rollins: Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter and yearend 2021 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we will begin.\nJulie Bimmerman: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Julie. First of all, I regret missing last quarter's call discussion. Nonetheless, my knee replacement therapy has been going well and it's great to be on the call with you this morning. I'm pleased to report that we experienced a very successful year, both financially and operationally, especially with our revenue and EPS growth. As we began 2022, we believe that Rollins is poised to deliver on our short term and long term objectives. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the New Year unfolds. As we previously disclosed, the company is in discussion with the staff at the US Security and Exchange Commission to resolve our SEC investigation. During the fourth quarter, we increased the accrual related to this matter to $8 million for a potential settlement. Given that the investigation is ongoing and out of respect for the process, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we are focused on resolving this inquiry in the very near future. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some of our business updates. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 performance and very proud of the hardworking men and women of our company that propelled us to achieve record levels of revenue growth across each of our brands. I'm also pleased to note that we again realized a very strong performance in our termite service line, posting year-over-year double-digit growth of 14.3%. While our termite business has been growing by double-digit for several years in a row now, termite damage claims as well as any related litigation have declined year by year reaching our lowest level in recent history during 2021. To be more specific, termite damage claims received have declined from a high of 9,349 to the low of 380 new claims received this past year. While at the same time, revenue from termite has tripled. The genesis of this great story started with a serious commitment to address a problem that had been building for several years, obviously resolve a loan wouldn't clean up a problem that large. Success came from a series of changes initiated by our leadership team to our culture, our training, our treatment protocols and our quality assurance processes. We significantly improved and expanded training of our field service and sales team members and our managers made that training mandatory before you could be allowed to service our customers. We held hundreds of regional training meetings and a multitude of termite-specific training modules were developed. We revised our treatment protocols to solve situations we were experiencing due in part to evolving new construction practices in various markets. These revised treatment protocols in many cases, exceeded state treating requirements. Additionally, we created a nationwide quality assurance team that took control of the claims process requiring our branch offices to report each claim immediately. This insured a quick response to our customers when most needed. This QA group also went to the field and inspected our team's work and verified that things were being done according to our new treating requirements. Finally, and maybe most important, the most difficult change was to our culture. As an example, any location, failing quality assurance team inspections had to make a trip to visit the division president of the company. Those that failed to adjust and adhere to the new practices by the time a follow up QA visit occurred, didn't receive a return trip. Change came quickly due to those practices. Fast forward to today and all our newly acquired companies are brought under these standards as quickly as possible. We believe these service level commitments are important to meet or exceed the expectations our customers have for us. Operationally, our service offering is led by a very strong and dedicated termite services group and a very experienced technical service team. I'm proud to work for a company that has made these commitments to protect our customers, our brands, and our reputation. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I'm going to focus on items that directly impacted our operations in the fourth quarter and then Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments, most notably the SEC accrual that impacted the year. 2021 was a strong and productive year for Rollins' family of pest control brands. Q4 revenues increased 11.9% to $600.3 million compared to $536.3 million the previous year. Net income rose to $65.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Our revenues for the full year were $2.424 billion, an increase of 12% compared to $2.161 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the full year increased 34.5% to $350.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Julie will review our full year GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. All our business lines experienced solid growth with residential pest control up 11.9% and termite realizing growth of 13.6%. Additionally, commercial pest control delivered an impressive 11.4% growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Julie will give you a more detailed breakdown on organic revenue growth by service line in a few moments. Before I move on from revenue and address expenses, I want to emphasize how proud we are of the growth rates we achieved in the fourth quarter and for the year. During the year coincidentally, Orkin reached their 120 anniversary and celebrated by putting up one of their best performances in years. All our brands grew and contributed greatly to our operating results. On the expense side, payroll, materials and supplies and fleet are three largest expense areas and I'll give you some additional color on how each of these items impacted margin in Q4. Let's start with labor. Remarkably, we've been able to achieve above average revenue growth rates while keeping our service payroll expense margins below last year in Q4. On a year to date basis, that expense margin is flat to 2020. Our administrative payroll margins also improved over 2020 as we continue to improve productivity. However, we did experience a slight increase in our sales payroll margin. The sales payroll expense trend is reflective of the planned investment we made in upstaffing our residential and commercial sales teams over the last 12 months. This investment yielded the high levels of growth I mentioned a few minutes ago. If there's an area I do not mind giving up margin to, it's sales payroll so long as we are growing revenue faster than the sales payroll expense. I'm proud of our team's ability to manage payroll expense despite recruiting challenges caused by labor shortages. Last week, we held our virtual will Rollins leadership meeting with over 175 of our top leaders. Most of our topics were about best practices in recruiting and retaining our people. This is a huge focus item for us in 2022. Let's move to materials and supplies costs, or M&S. Our M&S cost were a slight headwind in the quarter, particularly for our termite and ancillary service offerings where we've had more supply chain issues in the latter part of the year. Our, procurement team is working hard in this area by seeking alternate products while our operations team has analyzed the impact of these increases in adjusting our rate card pricing upward, where needed to counteract the rise in materials cost. Probably most impactful to us in Q4 is fleet expense, particularly fuel. Compared to Q4 of 2020 our fuel cost were up 56.5% in Q4 of 2021. That equated to over $4.5 million in increased fuel costs for the quarter. In addition, increases in fleet repair costs for items like tires and basic maintenance, also rose double digits. As we've discussed in the past, we're making significant progress with our BOSS operating systems routing and scheduling technologies, which help us mitigate some of these fuel cost increases. Since reducing miles driven between services saves not only fuel, but also time. This technology contributed in an either even bigger way to helping us manage our service payroll expense by enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner. We began to feel the first significant impacts of the fuel increases in Q2 of 2021. So we anticipate that fleet costs will continue to be a significant headwind for us in the first quarter of this year. Related to expenses is one other item I'd like to mention. Most are familiar with the cybersecurity attacks experience by solar winds and colonial pipeline and others that recently put a spotlight on cybersecurity threats. Due to concerns about these types of cybersecurity issues, in Q4, we fast tracked our multiyear strategy to enhance our protections against cybersecurity threats by accelerating a $3 million expenditure. We have a dedicated cyber team implementing enhanced cybersecurity controls for domestic and international operations to protect our employees, our customers and our brands. Shifting briefly to the acquisition landscape, we continue to successfully execute our acquisition strategy of identifying and acquiring high quality companies with shared culture and values. Last year ended strong with over 70% of our trailing 12 months revenue acquired occurring in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands and looking ahead, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie?\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, Jerry. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics. As we previously discussed in our third quarter conference calls, we assess the performance metrics we report to ensure they best articulate Rollins' business. To that end, we discuss several additional measure measurements we present each quarter, including EBITDA, free cash and total organic revenue growth. In addition, we're now including organic revenue growth by revenue type, specifically residential, commercial and termite. We believe this will bring further transparency to our revenue growth measurements. Also, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discuss within the earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. We realized we are going over a lot of information today and believe this will give you a resource to review what everything that we have covered. So now on to the numbers, our fourth quarter revenues of $600 million was an increase of 11.9% actual exchange rate growth, 8.9% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth percentage is calculated to 11% with an 8.1% organic. For the full year 2021, revenues of $2.4 billion with an increase of 12.2% over full year 2020, 9.5% organic. The constant exchange rate, total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.4%, 8.7% organic. As mentioned previously, residential commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. What Jerry did not tell you was that all three also grew double digits for the full year 2021 over 2020. For the fourth quarter growth over last year, residential grew 11.9%, 8.4% organic. Commercial grew 11.4%, 9.3% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.6% with 10.1% organic. For the full year 2021 over 2020, residential grew 12.9%, 10% organic, commercial grew 10.2%, 7.4% organic and we closed that with termite at 14.3% growth, 11.9% organic. Now to our income, for the fourth quarter and year to date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the one time super vesting of our late chairman's stock grants in the third quarter of 2020. The impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first six months of 2021 and our recorded accrual related to the potential settlement of the SEC matter in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted 2021 EBITDA was $122.2 million or 11.2% over 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.14 per diluted share or 7.7% improvement over 2020. For the full year 2021, our adjusted EBITDA with $546.4 million or 20.1% over last year. Year to date 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.68 per diluted share or 25.9% over 2020. For fourth quarter 2021, gross margin increased 50.4% or one tenth of a point over last year. That was after overcoming our strong headwinds of fleet expenses, specifically fuel in the amount of 4.5 million and termite M&F for $2.7 million. Sales, general and administrative fourth quarter 2021 margins increased 1.6 over last year. This was driven by the increase in sales salaries mentioned by Jerry, along with the increased SEC accrual. Without these two items, our SG&A fourth quarter margin presented an improvement over fourth quarter 2020. Related to the SEC potential settlement, we recorded an accrual of $5 million in Q4. This was in addition to the $3 million we previously accrued in the third quarter. These amounts are not tax deductible for state or federal taxes. The company continues to cooperate with SEC and working towards a final resolution. During the year we completed significant remediation efforts including the addition of a chief accounting officer, SEC attorney and SEC external reporting director. Also, we reevaluated and strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting while improving processes, procedures and related supporting documentation, including those related to management's judgment and estimates. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow, our dividends full year 2021 for $208.7 million or an increase of 30% over 2020 while cash used for acquisitions declined 5.8% to $139 million for 2021. We ended the current period with a $105.3 in cash of which $78.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiary. As you've probably noted over time, our foreign cash held has increased with the exception of used for acquisitions. We're in the process of restructuring our foreign entities to make cash from foreign operations, more readily available. This should be completed later in 2022. Now to free cash flow, for the fourth quarter of 2021, our free cash was $88.9 million or a decrease of 0.8% over last year. The decline was due to a capital expenditure increase from upgrading our data center facility as part of our cybersecurity initiative. Full year free cash flow was $395 million or decrease of $41 million. This decline was primarily due to the $30 million 2020 Cares Act taxes paid in 2021 and a $32 million gain from the sale of the Clark properties, the latter of which is an operating cash reconciling item. Last, I am happy to share that yesterday our board of directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2022. This represents the 25% increase of the March 2021 regular cash dividend paid out. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in 2021 and that accentuates our financial strength, our solid capital position and the board's confidence and our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn it back to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTim Mulrooney: John. Thanks for that excellent history of your termite service.\nJohn Wilson: You're welcome.\nTim Mulrooney: A couple questions on organic growth. So, the first one, on your commercial pests organic growth, it picked up in the fourth quarter, despite a more difficult comparison with last year. Can you talk a little bit more about your commercial pest business, what's maybe helping drive that acceleration? All else equal, we kind of expected your commercial business to continue to normalize back towards your historical range, but instead it picked up a little bit here. So just curious, what's going on?\nJerry Gahlhoff: This is Jerry, Tim. A lot of the commercial sales growth is a result of the investment that we've made in the staffing. We saw an opportunity to capitalize on the rebound and we began upstaffing in that amongst our commercial sales team over a year ago during when things were still rough, we were investing in the business and getting people up to speed and ramped up so that we would be ready for the rebound and we've just basically been able to capitalize on that.\nJohn Wilson: Yeah, Tim, and this is John. I might add that our commercial sales success was driven by both categories. And when I say both, I mean, local sales efforts, that's our local branches with feed on the street, adding accounts, but also our national accounts and I'm going off of memory. So forgive me if I'm off a little bit, but our national account sales effort for December was up some 50% or close to it. That indicates a lot of business being let out forbid to start the new year. But we were up in that one little month for by 50%. So pretty pleased with that.\nTim Mulrooney: That's really helpful color. Thanks guys. And I apologize for this next question, but there's a lot of numbers and perhaps misinformation being thrown around right now. So I just want to clarify. You guys revised your organic growth estimates. For the first half of 2021, you gave us that excellent table in your press release and you revised it to exclude all acquisitions, not just the significant acquisitions and by our math, it looks like the difference between the old definition of organic growth and the new definition is about 1% for the first half of 2021, the only periods in which we have both numbers. Is that also how you see it, that those bolt-ons added about one percentage point to revenue growth and do you think that that's a typical thing?\nJulie Bimmerman: I'd say that yes, I'd agree to your numbers and what you're saying on that front. A lot of it, as far as typical, it honestly depends on the, how many acquisitions are closing. When are they closing? What are the sizes of the acquisitions closing? So know it is not always, the 1% there's many times when it is lower. The only time when we see anything that would be high would be a large acquisition, like, Clark.\nJohn Wilson: Yeah, I would add that it, maybe it was typical for this year, Tim, but it's not always like that. So, we just -- we just never know. I think the benefit is -- kind of it with all extracted. Now it gives us a clearer picture.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. Really appreciate the time. I guess my question is just around your labor availability. And forgive me if I misheard it at the beginning of the call, but I know you added some color around maybe your completions, but maybe you can just talk to how the labor availability is impacting the business and how you guys are working through it. Is this just something where you're, you're obviously paying these people more, but maybe you can also talk about the impact, the higher wages for the service of the business could potentially have on 2022 margins?\nJohn Wilson: So Mario, let me take a stab at it first. And maybe Jerry will have something to add. So you'll recall in previous quarters as this was maybe a building issue. We talked about most of our pay plans are productivity driven. So the more work they produce, the more they earn. And so while we're certainly turning over more than our norm our people are still pretty well paid and we are getting the more placed. And so getting to the lion share of our work, we have very little of it that's fallen through the cracks. So no doubt, it's a tough environment. Our people, I've used the term turnover, a lot of rocks before our people are having to turn over a lot of rocks to find new people. But as we talked about in our leadership meeting, that Jerry referenced week, the best course of action is not to lose them in the first place, right? Keep them engaged, keep them happy and not lose them. And then you're not bearing that cost of replacing them. So we are seeing some inflation pressure on a few of our jobs, and most notably our termite service technicians, those are, are typically hourly and we've had to up our pay rates in some markets, but, but we're still getting people and we're getting to, to the line, share of our work.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would add as you look, as we look forward to 2022, we're really emphasizing to our managers about how much more time they need to spend on recruiting efforts as it's, if it may be that we have to spend as a hiring manager, you may have to spend two hours of your day, every day, focused on recruiting and hiring and on-boarding efforts. It's really an adjustment of how our managers have to spend our time in this changing environment. And that's a big part of what we look at and that's our -- that's a big part of our solution to how we handle this in the coming year.\nMario Cortellacci: Yeah. And I think you guys have done a good job with managing cost and seeing margin expansion through different points in the cycle. But I guess just for 2022 and I understand that you guys don't guide, but just thinking about 2022, do you guys think you can continue the same type of historical performance with margin expansion?\nJohn Wilson: That's certainly our expectation.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. And then just the,\nJerry Gahlhoff: I'm sorry, go ahead. I was just to say that, this is Jerry. I said, that's what -- that's what we strive to do; Always looking to get better.\nMario Cortellacci: Okay. And then just the last one from me you guys have obviously heard about the large deal going on in the space whether it gets completed or it doesn't get completed, but if it go through and I guess just maybe how are you guys thinking about the impact, the competition within the space? I don't know if execution on their side creates opportunity for you, does a larger player impact your ability to win new business. Obviously you guys have invested in your Salesforce heavily over the past year, but and that probably sets you up better, but any thoughts around kind of the competitive dynamics and how they shift if the deal goes through?\nGary Rollins: Well we we've been competing with, both concerns. We think that there's going to be a lot of work to be done on with a merger of that size, which really provides opportunity. As the term oil really has typically generated turnover as far as customers are concerned. And certainly employees are concerned many will enjoy the new relationships, but others will not. So we look at it as it, an opportunity, but that doesn't really take our eye off of our business. Cause in the end that's really what matters.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah. Mr. Rollins at the end of the, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about it, have we? It's -- it is not been high on our radar screen. We focus on what we do and getting the results that we get, and that's where we put our efforts.\nGary Rollins: And it works.\nJerry Gahlhoff: That's right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabra of RBC Markets, please go ahead.\nAshish Sabra: Thanks for taking my question. There was a reference to a rate card increase for the termite business. I was wondering if you could talk about how the pricing is trending and is there an opportunity to flex higher than your traditional 1% to 2% as we go into 2022? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: The beauty of -- this is Jerry. The beauty of a rate card increases that unlike just a price increase to a recurring customer is that we can adjust that with a lot of flexibility in fairly real time. So if we saw a material increase in cost by X percent, we can, and pretty quickly in our rate card, moving forward, just increase our entire rate card to cover those that increase in expenses or whatever we deem necessary. And we can use the same, not only in materials and supplies, but also if we're experiencing some labor challenges or whatever, we can make those adjustments and usually make those adjustments within a week or so of us doing the analysis and figuring that out. So it's a little bit different than our recurring, like say as control or some sort of contract based revenue, price increase. It's a different model.\nAshish Sabra: That's really helpful color. Maybe if I can just ask a quick follow up on that point itself. Can you just talk about which all businesses have cards? I, you, you obviously mentioned the termite but there what are other businesses where you may also have a similar rate card?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Everything has a right card.\nJohn Wilson: If we acquire a business that doesn't, we put one in pretty quickly. We want to bring structure and kind of logic to our pricing and everything we do,\nGary Rollins: John that's how, yeah, this is Gary, if I could add over the years, we've gotten fairly sophisticated in our rate cards and our price increases and so forth. It sounds like it's pretty simple, but we look at where the customer is currently, what they're currently charging when they've last had an increase the market, the competition and so forth. So, I think John made a great point. That's probably the first thing that we really address when we do make an acquisition. Typically competitors are, are slow to raise their rates. And we were historically, I mean, we had the same situation, but as we increased rates over the years and added the sophistication and data we've been and good at it. And it's really a margin contributor when we buy a Company\nAshish Sabra: That's very helpful color. And if I could ask my second question around as you talked about the, in some of the inflationary or the employee turnover is is affecting everyone in the industry, obviously Orkin's given your brand a strong brand presence. You've been able to manage it much better versus maybe the long tail and given how fragmented the best control industry is, it potentially might be affecting the private players or the smaller players a lot more than Orkin's. And so my question there was how that help Orkin's, does that help you in terms of your growth potential, but also does it -- has that been a positive tailor from a M&A perspective? Does it open up more opportunities for M&A as some of these private or smaller players are unable to handle these inflationary pressures? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: This is Jerry. There's no doubt that the Orkin brand and the brand presence, the amount of marketing you see on television, on various social media, how they go to market, has helped their employment brand as well, to make them that Employer of Choice in our industry. And certainly they -- I'm not saying they have an easier, easy time, but they have maybe a little bit of an easier time because they do have such a strong brand and such strong brand recognition from an employment standpoint. There's certainly that, that type of tailwind that they get, there's no doubt, compared to say a, a small Mom-and-Pop Company, something along those lines. We, we definitely have some advantages there.\nAshish Sabra: That's helpful. And then just, if you could talk about the M&A, how is that helpful helping you from an M&A perspective you are of the ability to acquire some of these smaller private companies, which may be struggling with this inflation of the environment?\nJohn Wilson: Yeah. So this, this is John. What I would say to that is that may be certainly a factor in their decision making kind of process to sell or not sell. I think what we saw last year, more than anything was concern over taxes and what was going to happen with that. So, I would think that that say that was a bigger factor.\nAshish Sabra: That's very helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Hi everybody. Thank you for taking the questions this morning. So, mine comes back to growth and will you share and help us understand what composes the underlying organic growth and in a perfect world to be by line of business, but can you give us a sense of how we should think about breaking up the growth and between price, new customer ads, cross selling and where I'm going with that is you, the underlying industry growth, every on all the rate the trade groups, what have you say it's 5% roughly. So you've been growing substantially organically, substantially greater than that. Now for several years, you're not little as a Company. I'm trying to understand where's that sustainability of that, is it at the high-end a 100% or does it start easing back towards more like 50% and why?\nJohn Wilson: So, Michael, this is John. Let me kind of take a stab at what you're asking and then we'll go from there. So I'll start with the termite business. And we had kind of been in a long slow slide in terms of our termite customer base had been going down for many years. Part of that was by design. As we experienced some of the termite claims issues, that I mentioned that the -- during my piece, we moved the mix of, of business. So, we were up over 20% when that started. And I think we're now at around 17 for termite, but our termite customer base has started increasing. The last two years, we're adding to our customer base. And so that's, driving a big piece of it there as new customers, as it is in all of our segments. We're adding we added I forget the number exactly from 2020, but some, 60,000 new customers for our residential pest control group just in, or, and alone. And, the same has happening for commercial. So the lion share is, is of new with new customer additions. Keeping them just the [indiscernible] longer, always helps as well. And then we're still kind of historically at that 1% or so that we can point to and say, it's price. Anything to add Jerry, I don't\u2026\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would say if you're looking at the, the difference, what the difference is, it's really when you're improved your customer retention rate, and you are adding customers at a higher rates than you had historically, then you get the kind of growth that we get. Those are the main drivers.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, fair enough. And, I get the investment in people and training and what you've done to make this a better run business. How long can you sustain that wide of a gap to the underlying market growth?\nJerry Gahlhoff: We're going to keep trying, we're going to keep working on it.\nJohn Wilson: Hey, Michael, we, our plan for 2022 is built on doing better than what we did in '21. So, we don't, we don't know, I guess it's probably the easy answer, but it's certainly our intention to keep chipping at it.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then Gary, you did make an in, I think it was Gary made an inference that you thought taxes drove M&A, so taxes have been put to bed. I think it would appear that we've pretty much got gridlocks. So do you expect the pace to slow or does the challenges around labor and inflation and what have you create an incremental catalyst and therefore the M&A outlook remains as promising is it was in '21?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah, Michael. So that was me, that John didn\u2019t mentioned that. And you're right. I mean, as the year wore on it got less and less maybe certain that that tax law would change. Hopefully, hopefully we're at gridlock with it. I and that, and on that subject but, but it may well happen that, that some of the other challenges, whether it's just the day to day running the business and the costs, different things, that's inflation, that's going on and buying products or whatever. They'll all add up to a continued acquisition market. We think that's kind of the case.\nGary Rollins: And we started the year out with acquisition potential deals in the hopper. So that's a good sign as well.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nGary Rollins: Well, thank you. We appreciate your support and interest in Rollins. Before we close, I'd like to share that Dr. Tom Lawley has decided to retire from service on our board at the end of his current firm, on behalf of our board and our entire team and myself, we'd like to recognize and thank Dr. Lawley for everything that he's done for our organization over the last 16 years. I don't believe he's ever missed a meeting. And his contribution's mirror is distinction distinguished service with Emory. Tom, you will be missed. Rollins is excited about our opportunities for growth in 2022. And we look forward to sharing our progress during our first quarter conference call in April. Thank you again,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, Jerry. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics. As we previously discussed in our third quarter conference calls, we assess the performance metrics we report to ensure they best articulate Rollins' business. To that end, we discuss several additional measure measurements we present each quarter, including EBITDA, free cash and total organic revenue growth. In addition, we're now including organic revenue growth by revenue type, specifically residential, commercial and termite. We believe this will bring further transparency to our revenue growth measurements. Also, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discuss within the earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. We realized we are going over a lot of information today and believe this will give you a resource to review what everything that we have covered. So now on to the numbers, our fourth quarter revenues of $600 million was an increase of 11.9% actual exchange rate growth, 8.9% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth percentage is calculated to 11% with an 8.1% organic. For the full year 2021, revenues of $2.4 billion with an increase of 12.2% over full year 2020, 9.5% organic. The constant exchange rate, total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.4%, 8.7% organic. As mentioned previously, residential commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. What Jerry did not tell you was that all three also grew double digits for the full year 2021 over 2020. For the fourth quarter growth over last year, residential grew 11.9%, 8.4% organic. Commercial grew 11.4%, 9.3% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.6% with 10.1% organic. For the full year 2021 over 2020, residential grew 12.9%, 10% organic, commercial grew 10.2%, 7.4% organic and we closed that with termite at 14.3% growth, 11.9% organic. Now to our income, for the fourth quarter and year to date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the one time super vesting of our late chairman's stock grants in the third quarter of 2020. The impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first six months of 2021 and our recorded accrual related to the potential settlement of the SEC matter in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Fourth quarter adjusted 2021 EBITDA was $122.2 million or 11.2% over 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.14 per diluted share or 7.7% improvement over 2020. For the full year 2021, our adjusted EBITDA with $546.4 million or 20.1% over last year. Year to date 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.68 per diluted share or 25.9% over 2020. For fourth quarter 2021, gross margin increased 50.4% or one tenth of a point over last year. That was after overcoming our strong headwinds of fleet expenses, specifically fuel in the amount of 4.5 million and termite M&F for $2.7 million. Sales, general and administrative fourth quarter 2021 margins increased 1.6 over last year. This was driven by the increase in sales salaries mentioned by Jerry, along with the increased SEC accrual. Without these two items, our SG&A fourth quarter margin presented an improvement over fourth quarter 2020. Related to the SEC potential settlement, we recorded an accrual of $5 million in Q4. This was in addition to the $3 million we previously accrued in the third quarter. These amounts are not tax deductible for state or federal taxes. The company continues to cooperate with SEC and working towards a final resolution. During the year we completed significant remediation efforts including the addition of a chief accounting officer, SEC attorney and SEC external reporting director. Also, we reevaluated and strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting while improving processes, procedures and related supporting documentation, including those related to management's judgment and estimates. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow, our dividends full year 2021 for $208.7 million or an increase of 30% over 2020 while cash used for acquisitions declined 5.8% to $139 million for 2021. We ended the current period with a $105.3 in cash of which $78.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiary. As you've probably noted over time, our foreign cash held has increased with the exception of used for acquisitions. We're in the process of restructuring our foreign entities to make cash from foreign operations, more readily available. This should be completed later in 2022. Now to free cash flow, for the fourth quarter of 2021, our free cash was $88.9 million or a decrease of 0.8% over last year. The decline was due to a capital expenditure increase from upgrading our data center facility as part of our cybersecurity initiative. Full year free cash flow was $395 million or decrease of $41 million. This decline was primarily due to the $30 million 2020 Cares Act taxes paid in 2021 and a $32 million gain from the sale of the Clark properties, the latter of which is an operating cash reconciling item. Last, I am happy to share that yesterday our board of directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2022. This represents the 25% increase of the March 2021 regular cash dividend paid out. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in 2021 and that accentuates our financial strength, our solid capital position and the board's confidence and our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn it back to you. I'd say that yes, I'd agree to your numbers and what you're saying on that front. A lot of it, as far as typical, it honestly depends on the, how many acquisitions are closing. When are they closing? What are the sizes of the acquisitions closing? So know it is not always, the 1% there's many times when it is lower. The only time when we see anything that would be high would be a large acquisition, like, Clark."

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I'm going to focus on items that directly impacted our operations in the fourth quarter and then Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments, most notably the SEC accrual that impacted the year. 2021 was a strong and productive year for Rollins' family of pest control brands. Q4 revenues increased 11.9% to $600.3 million compared to $536.3 million the previous year. Net income rose to $65.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $62.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Our revenues for the full year were $2.424 billion, an increase of 12% compared to $2.161 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the full year increased 34.5% to $350.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $260.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Julie will review our full year GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. All our business lines experienced solid growth with residential pest control up 11.9% and termite realizing growth of 13.6%. Additionally, commercial pest control delivered an impressive 11.4% growth over the fourth quarter of last year. Julie will give you a more detailed breakdown on organic revenue growth by service line in a few moments. Before I move on from revenue and address expenses, I want to emphasize how proud we are of the growth rates we achieved in the fourth quarter and for the year. During the year coincidentally, Orkin reached their 120 anniversary and celebrated by putting up one of their best performances in years. All our brands grew and contributed greatly to our operating results. On the expense side, payroll, materials and supplies and fleet are three largest expense areas and I'll give you some additional color on how each of these items impacted margin in Q4. Let's start with labor. Remarkably, we've been able to achieve above average revenue growth rates while keeping our service payroll expense margins below last year in Q4. On a year to date basis, that expense margin is flat to 2020. Our administrative payroll margins also improved over 2020 as we continue to improve productivity. However, we did experience a slight increase in our sales payroll margin. The sales payroll expense trend is reflective of the planned investment we made in upstaffing our residential and commercial sales teams over the last 12 months. This investment yielded the high levels of growth I mentioned a few minutes ago. If there's an area I do not mind giving up margin to, it's sales payroll so long as we are growing revenue faster than the sales payroll expense. I'm proud of our team's ability to manage payroll expense despite recruiting challenges caused by labor shortages. Last week, we held our virtual will Rollins leadership meeting with over 175 of our top leaders. Most of our topics were about best practices in recruiting and retaining our people. This is a huge focus item for us in 2022. Let's move to materials and supplies costs, or M&S. Our M&S cost were a slight headwind in the quarter, particularly for our termite and ancillary service offerings where we've had more supply chain issues in the latter part of the year. Our, procurement team is working hard in this area by seeking alternate products while our operations team has analyzed the impact of these increases in adjusting our rate card pricing upward, where needed to counteract the rise in materials cost. Probably most impactful to us in Q4 is fleet expense, particularly fuel. Compared to Q4 of 2020 our fuel cost were up 56.5% in Q4 of 2021. That equated to over $4.5 million in increased fuel costs for the quarter. In addition, increases in fleet repair costs for items like tires and basic maintenance, also rose double digits. As we've discussed in the past, we're making significant progress with our BOSS operating systems routing and scheduling technologies, which help us mitigate some of these fuel cost increases. Since reducing miles driven between services saves not only fuel, but also time. This technology contributed in an either even bigger way to helping us manage our service payroll expense by enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner. We began to feel the first significant impacts of the fuel increases in Q2 of 2021. So we anticipate that fleet costs will continue to be a significant headwind for us in the first quarter of this year. Related to expenses is one other item I'd like to mention. Most are familiar with the cybersecurity attacks experience by solar winds and colonial pipeline and others that recently put a spotlight on cybersecurity threats. Due to concerns about these types of cybersecurity issues, in Q4, we fast tracked our multiyear strategy to enhance our protections against cybersecurity threats by accelerating a $3 million expenditure. We have a dedicated cyber team implementing enhanced cybersecurity controls for domestic and international operations to protect our employees, our customers and our brands. Shifting briefly to the acquisition landscape, we continue to successfully execute our acquisition strategy of identifying and acquiring high quality companies with shared culture and values. Last year ended strong with over 70% of our trailing 12 months revenue acquired occurring in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased to welcome these companies and their teams to the Rollins family of brands and looking ahead, we expect that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow our business. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie? This is Jerry, Tim. A lot of the commercial sales growth is a result of the investment that we've made in the staffing. We saw an opportunity to capitalize on the rebound and we began upstaffing in that amongst our commercial sales team over a year ago during when things were still rough, we were investing in the business and getting people up to speed and ramped up so that we would be ready for the rebound and we've just basically been able to capitalize on that. I would add as you look, as we look forward to 2022, we're really emphasizing to our managers about how much more time they need to spend on recruiting efforts as it's, if it may be that we have to spend as a hiring manager, you may have to spend two hours of your day, every day, focused on recruiting and hiring and on-boarding efforts. It's really an adjustment of how our managers have to spend our time in this changing environment. And that's a big part of what we look at and that's our -- that's a big part of our solution to how we handle this in the coming year. I'm sorry, go ahead. I was just to say that, this is Jerry. I said, that's what -- that's what we strive to do; Always looking to get better. Yeah. Mr. Rollins at the end of the, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about it, have we? It's -- it is not been high on our radar screen. We focus on what we do and getting the results that we get, and that's where we put our efforts. That's right. The beauty of -- this is Jerry. The beauty of a rate card increases that unlike just a price increase to a recurring customer is that we can adjust that with a lot of flexibility in fairly real time. So if we saw a material increase in cost by X percent, we can, and pretty quickly in our rate card, moving forward, just increase our entire rate card to cover those that increase in expenses or whatever we deem necessary. And we can use the same, not only in materials and supplies, but also if we're experiencing some labor challenges or whatever, we can make those adjustments and usually make those adjustments within a week or so of us doing the analysis and figuring that out. So it's a little bit different than our recurring, like say as control or some sort of contract based revenue, price increase. It's a different model. Everything has a right card. This is Jerry. There's no doubt that the Orkin brand and the brand presence, the amount of marketing you see on television, on various social media, how they go to market, has helped their employment brand as well, to make them that Employer of Choice in our industry. And certainly they -- I'm not saying they have an easier, easy time, but they have maybe a little bit of an easier time because they do have such a strong brand and such strong brand recognition from an employment standpoint.

I mean, as the year wore on it got less and less maybe certain that that tax law would change. Hopefully, hopefully we're at gridlock with it. I and that, and on that subject but, but it may well happen that, that some of the other challenges, whether it's just the day to day running the business and the costs, different things, that's inflation, that's going on and buying products or whatever. They'll all add up to a continued acquisition market. We think that's kind of the case."

            "content": "Thank you, Julie. First of all, I regret missing last quarter's call discussion. Nonetheless, my knee replacement therapy has been going well and it's great to be on the call with you this morning. I'm pleased to report that we experienced a very successful year, both financially and operationally, especially with our revenue and EPS growth. As we began 2022, we believe that Rollins is poised to deliver on our short term and long term objectives. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as the New Year unfolds. As we previously disclosed, the company is in discussion with the staff at the US Security and Exchange Commission to resolve our SEC investigation. During the fourth quarter, we increased the accrual related to this matter to $8 million for a potential settlement. Given that the investigation is ongoing and out of respect for the process, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we are focused on resolving this inquiry in the very near future. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some of our business updates. John? Thank you and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are extremely pleased with our 2021 performance and very proud of the hardworking men and women of our company that propelled us to achieve record levels of revenue growth across each of our brands. I'm also pleased to note that we again realized a very strong performance in our termite service line, posting year-over-year double-digit growth of 14.3%. While our termite business has been growing by double-digit for several years in a row now, termite damage claims as well as any related litigation have declined year by year reaching our lowest level in recent history during 2021. To be more specific, termite damage claims received have declined from a high of 9,349 to the low of 380 new claims received this past year. While at the same time, revenue from termite has tripled. The genesis of this great story started with a serious commitment to address a problem that had been building for several years, obviously resolve a loan wouldn't clean up a problem that large. Success came from a series of changes initiated by our leadership team to our culture, our training, our treatment protocols and our quality assurance processes. We significantly improved and expanded training of our field service and sales team members and our managers made that training mandatory before you could be allowed to service our customers. We held hundreds of regional training meetings and a multitude of termite-specific training modules were developed. We revised our treatment protocols to solve situations we were experiencing due in part to evolving new construction practices in various markets. These revised treatment protocols in many cases, exceeded state treating requirements. Additionally, we created a nationwide quality assurance team that took control of the claims process requiring our branch offices to report each claim immediately. This insured a quick response to our customers when most needed. This QA group also went to the field and inspected our team's work and verified that things were being done according to our new treating requirements. Finally, and maybe most important, the most difficult change was to our culture. As an example, any location, failing quality assurance team inspections had to make a trip to visit the division president of the company. Those that failed to adjust and adhere to the new practices by the time a follow up QA visit occurred, didn't receive a return trip. Change came quickly due to those practices. Fast forward to today and all our newly acquired companies are brought under these standards as quickly as possible. We believe these service level commitments are important to meet or exceed the expectations our customers have for us. Operationally, our service offering is led by a very strong and dedicated termite services group and a very experienced technical service team. I'm proud to work for a company that has made these commitments to protect our customers, our brands, and our reputation. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. You're welcome. Yeah, Tim, and this is John. I might add that our commercial sales success was driven by both categories. And when I say both, I mean, local sales efforts, that's our local branches with feed on the street, adding accounts, but also our national accounts and I'm going off of memory. So forgive me if I'm off a little bit, but our national account sales effort for December was up some 50% or close to it. That indicates a lot of business being let out forbid to start the new year. But we were up in that one little month for by 50%. So pretty pleased with that. Yeah, I would add that it, maybe it was typical for this year, Tim, but it's not always like that. So, we just -- we just never know. I think the benefit is -- kind of it with all extracted. Now it gives us a clearer picture. So Mario, let me take a stab at it first. And maybe Jerry will have something to add. So you'll recall in previous quarters as this was maybe a building issue. We talked about most of our pay plans are productivity driven. So the more work they produce, the more they earn. And so while we're certainly turning over more than our norm our people are still pretty well paid and we are getting the more placed. And so getting to the lion share of our work, we have very little of it that's fallen through the cracks. So no doubt, it's a tough environment. Our people, I've used the term turnover, a lot of rocks before our people are having to turn over a lot of rocks to find new people. But as we talked about in our leadership meeting, that Jerry referenced week, the best course of action is not to lose them in the first place, right? Keep them engaged, keep them happy and not lose them. And then you're not bearing that cost of replacing them. So we are seeing some inflation pressure on a few of our jobs, and most notably our termite service technicians, those are, are typically hourly and we've had to up our pay rates in some markets, but, but we're still getting people and we're getting to, to the line, share of our work. That's certainly our expectation. If we acquire a business that doesn't, we put one in pretty quickly. We want to bring structure and kind of logic to our pricing and everything we do, Yeah. So this, this is John. What I would say to that is that may be certainly a factor in their decision making kind of process to sell or not sell. I think what we saw last year, more than anything was concern over taxes and what was going to happen with that. So, I would think that that say that was a bigger factor. So, Michael, this is John. Let me kind of take a stab at what you're asking and then we'll go from there. So I'll start with the termite business. And we had kind of been in a long slow slide in terms of our termite customer base had been going down for many years. Part of that was by design. As we experienced some of the termite claims issues, that I mentioned that the -- during my piece, we moved the mix of, of business. So, we were up over 20% when that started. And I think we're now at around 17 for termite, but our termite customer base has started increasing. The last two years, we're adding to our customer base. And so that's, driving a big piece of it there as new customers, as it is in all of our segments. We're adding we added I forget the number exactly from 2020, but some, 60,000 new customers for our residential pest control group just in, or, and alone. And, the same has happening for commercial. So the lion share is, is of new with new customer additions. Keeping them just the [indiscernible] longer, always helps as well. And then we're still kind of historically at that 1% or so that we can point to and say, it's price. Anything to add Jerry, I don't... Hey, Michael, we, our plan for 2022 is built on doing better than what we did in '21. So, we don't, we don't know, I guess it's probably the easy answer, but it's certainly our intention to keep chipping at it."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our fourth quarter and yearend 2021 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we will begin. Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Well we we've been competing with, both concerns. We think that there's going to be a lot of work to be done on with a merger of that size, which really provides opportunity. As the term oil really has typically generated turnover as far as customers are concerned. And certainly employees are concerned many will enjoy the new relationships, but others will not. So we look at it as it, an opportunity, but that doesn't really take our eye off of our business. Cause in the end that's really what matters. And it works. John that's how, yeah, this is Gary, if I could add over the years, we've gotten fairly sophisticated in our rate cards and our price increases and so forth. It sounds like it's pretty simple, but we look at where the customer is currently, what they're currently charging when they've last had an increase the market, the competition and so forth. So, I think John made a great point. That's probably the first thing that we really address when we do make an acquisition. Typically competitors are, are slow to raise their rates. And we were historically, I mean, we had the same situation, but as we increased rates over the years and added the sophistication and data we've been and good at it. And it's really a margin contributor when we buy a Company And we started the year out with acquisition potential deals in the hopper. So that's a good sign as well. Well, thank you. We appreciate your support and interest in Rollins. Before we close, I'd like to share that Dr. Tom Lawley has decided to retire from service on our board at the end of his current firm, on behalf of our board and our entire team and myself, we'd like to recognize and thank Dr. Lawley for everything that he's done for our organization over the last 16 years. I don't believe he's ever missed a meeting. And his contribution's mirror is distinction distinguished service with Emory. Tom, you will be missed. Rollins is excited about our opportunities for growth in 2022. And we look forward to sharing our progress during our first quarter conference call in April. Thank you again,"

We appreciate all of you joining us for our third quarter 2021 conference call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we will begin.\nJulie Bimmerman: Our earnings release discussions -- or sorry, discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that will be made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Julie. Before we begin, I am sure you have noticed that Gary is not on today's conference call. He is actively rehabbing from a knee replacement operation. And while he is recovering quickly, he is doing very well. He's just not in a position to physically join us today. We wish Gary well with his physical therapy and look forward to having him rejoin us on future calls. During the third quarter, we achieved some very strong business results, and Jerry will go over those with you shortly. In the interim, I wanted to share news of the latest addition to our Rollins Board of Directors. As you already know, over the previous year, we have enhanced and diversified that group with several new members. I am very pleased to announce our latest addition is Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Gahlhoff. This is in recognition of his strong leadership and his deep commitment to the company's long-term success. We are proud to have Jerry serving on our Board moving forward. Jerry is an important part of the Rollins leadership team, and his in-depth knowledge of our business and experience gained from working in our industry since 1991 adds perspective. We're fortunate to have him assume a greater role in the direction and future of our company. Before turning the call over to Jerry, I have 2 items to first update you on. The first will represent a recent development in Rollins' environmental, social and governance commitment. We take very seriously the responsibility that we have to the communities in which we work and live. As a recent example, we're pleased to share that Rollins has made an in-kind donation originally costing $4.6 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, items during the third quarter. Working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and several philanthropic organizations, including the Friends of Disabled Adults and Children, the Foundation of Hope Food Bank as well as Cope Preparedness in Los Angeles, we donated 27 pallets or 6.8 million pieces of masks, gloves and other items. In addition to achieving the successful execution of our strategies as well as solid business results, we also have a responsibility to the communities in which we work and live. EFC is a facet of our business is becoming more and more important to us. We are proud to support these initiatives. Last, as we have previously disclosed, the company has been responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with accounting standard ASC 450, we have established a reserve related to this matter, which we consider immaterial. Given that the investigation is ongoing, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we remain focused on resolving this inquiry. With that, I will turn our call over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $79.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. Revenues for the first 9 months of 2021 were $1.824 billion, an increase of 12.2% compared to $1.625 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased 44% to $285.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $198.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 11.7% and termite presenting 15% growth over the third quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 10.1% growth over the third quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 7.9% growth over 2 years ago when we were not experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. Rollins remains well positioned for the remainder of the year and into 2022 Looking deeper at our operating results, we're attracting customers to all our services and brands. And one area I'd like to focus on today is our continued strong growth in our wildlife service offerings. Trutech Wildlife joined the Rollins family in 2010, followed by Critter Control in 2015. Since 2010, the business has grown 800%. Day-to-day operations of operating a wildlife control business is quite different than running a typical pest and termite business, and we are proud to have a dedicated team focused on this much needed service. Originally concentrated in the Southeastern United States, the business has expanded across the nation as well as into Canada. And with Critter Control's expansion into Canada, it's Rollins' first brand to enter an international country without acquiring another business as a platform. The Wildlife division also operates a thriving franchise system. There are currently 84 franchises with the most recent franchise launching in Mansfield, Ohio. We anticipate finishing the year with 12 new franchises, one of our strongest years in adding franchisees. We have also been fortunate to add 9 former corporate employees as franchisees, employees who have an entrepreneurial drive and a passion for wildlife and customer service have multiple career path opportunities, be it ownership of the franchise or growth within our company. We believe there is meaningful opportunity for continued growth in our Wildlife business and look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead. I'd now like to discuss Hurricane Ida. Our hearts go out to our Gulf Coast region and those that were affected by the hurricane. But I must admit we are inspired by our team in that area. They implemented an amazing plan that helped our team members and alleviate the negative impact of the storm. I have shut down several of our branches for days, but 2 locations were shut down for about 2 weeks. The impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business in the quarter. Thankfully, all of our employees in the area were safe, yet they did need assistance. Through the Rollins Employee Relief Fund, we granted 137 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first week following the hurricane to enable employees to address their personal essential needs. Since then, another 7 employees who endured greater hardships received full grants to address their more significant needs. Additionally, our Orkin South Central division, led by Leland Morris, quickly initiated a preparedness and mitigation plan to assist our team members. This included immediate procurement of much needed supplies for our employees and their families, such as generators, fuel, portable air conditioners, fans, water and other essential emergency provisions that were not readily accessible to them locally. Our team members in adjacent areas that were fortunate to avoid the brunt of Ida's force volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours, to load these supplies into box trucks and drive them to those most in need. For weeks, they continue to shuttle fuel to these employees to keep their generators up and running. This was a total team effort, and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to one another. In fact, we're so pleased with their effort that we plan to expand and formalize this program in other areas of the country so that we can rapidly respond in case of a natural disaster or emergency. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarterly moving forward. The first is a measure we have referred to periodically and that is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Due to our consistent high volume of acquisitions and hence, high amortization expense related to these acquisitions, presenting EBITDA regularly will provide a clearer picture of our operation's ongoing financial performance. Think about this, over the last 3 years, we have averaged 30 acquisitions per year. Next, we will begin presenting our revenue growth through both constant exchange rate and actual exchange rate. By utilizing historical baseline revenues for acquisitions betted through the due diligence process, we were able to include all acquisitions within the calculations, both stand-alone and tuck-in. This will bring clarity and consistency to both our acquisition and our organic revenue growth measurements. Third, we'll be providing you with our free cash flow. We believe that this will properly illustrate Rollins' strong ability to generate cash. We have taken a simple approach to defining free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of equipment and property. Our hope is that these measurements will enable investors to better assess our operating performance in the future and provide a deeper view of our business. We have included GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on each of these metrics on our earnings press release published this morning. So on to the numbers. Our third quarter revenues of $650.2 million was an increase of 11.4% over last year. Of the 11.4% actual exchange rate revenue growth, acquisition growth was 2.2% and organic equated to 9.2%. For the constant exchange rate, the growth percentages calculated within the hundreds of the actual exchange growth rate, therefore, presented the same. For the 9 months ended September 2021, revenues of $1.824 billion was an increase of 12.12 percentage over year-to-date 2020. Of this actual exchange rate, total revenue growth of 2 -- or excuse me, of 12.2%, 2.7% was related to acquisitions and 9.5% organic growth. The constant year-to-date exchange rate total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.6%, 2.7% represented acquisitions and 8.9% organic revenue growth. As Jerry pointed out, residential, commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. So in determining my focus for today, I decided to take Jerry's lead and discuss Wildlife, yet I'm discussing specifically company-owned Wildlife operations. For the third quarter in 2021, Wildlife revenues grew 24.1% over last year. And year-to-date, Wildlife has presented an overall revenue growth of 27.6%. What makes this particularly impressive is that this is after their strong growth of 20.4% last year. So similar to our residential pest control, Wildlife did not feel a negative impact to revenue growth during the pandemic. So way to go to the Wildlife team. Now on to our income. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the onetime super busting of our late Chairman stock grant in the third quarter of 2020 and the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first 6 months of 2021. The third quarter 2021 EBITDA was $150.9 million or 8.7% over 2020 third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $138.9 million. Third quarter 2021 EPS was $0.19 per diluted share or 5.6% improvement over the 2020 third quarter adjusted EPS. For the 9 months ended September 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $421.2 million or 22.1% over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $344.9 million. Year-to-date, 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share or 26.2% over last year. For the third quarter 2021, gross margin increased to 53% or 0.4% over last year. Strong improvements in our materials and supplies were negatively offset by high overall fleet costs, primarily from an increase in fuel of approximately $4 million over third quarter 2020 and lower vehicle gains of $900,000 compared to last year. Sales, general and administrative third quarter margin increase over last year was strongly impacted by the PPE donations and the SEC accrual previously mentioned by John. Travel expenses have also increased $1.3 million in the third quarter as we have begun to lift our company travel restrictions. Amortization expenses for the third quarter 2021 increased $1.4 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from multiple acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation of $201,000 due to the sale of owned vehicles and centralizing of IT function. Overall, this equated to a 5.1% increase in depreciation and amortization over the third quarter 2020. Our dividends paid year-to-date 2021 was $119.7 million or an increase of 30.4% over last year. We ended the current period with $117.7 million in cash, of which $73.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. So this brings us to the final of our new 3 measurements, free cash flow. For the third quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $72.9 million or a decrease of 27.5% over the same quarter last year. For the 9 months ended 2021, our free cash flow equals $278.9 million or 13.6% decrease over year-to-date 2020. This fluctuation occurred due to the deferral of $30.3 million in FICA taxes payable in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act. These associated taxes were then remitted in September of 2021. We hope that the discussion of these new measurements, you will receive a greater clarity while reviewing our financial performance. Lastly, I want to discuss that yesterday, we were extremely pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 25% increase to our dividend. The quarterly dividend increased $0.10 -- to $0.10 per share from $0.08 per share and will be paid on December 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2021. Additionally, the Board also approved a special dividend of $0.08 to be paid on December 10, 2021, as well. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and underscores our financial strength, our solid capital position and the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. John, I'll turn it back to you.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Julie. We are happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: John, Jerry and Julie, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and sending my best to Gary on a quick recovery. So yes, just 2 questions for me. The first one, Julie, I apologize if I missed it, but did you give organic growth by segments in the prepared remarks?\nJulie Bimmerman: No, we did not. We just gave the organic on the overall.\nTim Mulrooney: Is it a change in policy for the company now that you won't be providing that? That's been pretty critical in terms of us understanding how the company is performing.\nJulie Bimmerman: At this point, with our change, we're trying to give you additional clarity by giving a very clean organic and the acquisition growth numbers. So we will be staying for here for now.\nTim Mulrooney: And I did want to confirm that because I know that's been an area of focus. The organic number this quarter excludes all acquisitions, both large and bolt-on?\nJulie Bimmerman: Yes, 100%. All acquisitions are excluded.\nTim Mulrooney: My next question is on margins. EBITDA margin contracted, I think, about 60 basis points year-over-year and 140 basis points sequentially. Can you talk about the primary factors that caused that 140 basis point contraction from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year? I have to imagine that it's probably labor related because I don't think materials and supplies are a large enough component of your COGS to really cause us much of a headwind. But I wanted to get your thoughts on that.\nJulie Bimmerman: I'm going to go ahead and kick this first to Jerry, and then I'll see if I want to add anything on to that.\nJerry Gahlhoff: The biggest headwind we had, Tim, this is Jerry, in the quarter, was fuel prices. Fuel expense was up significantly. We were able to manage the labor part pretty well. From -- as a percentage of revenue, labor wasn't as big of a deal. So we just had higher fleet expenses probably more than anything. John, what would you add to that? Anything?\nJohn Wilson: Yes. I would second the labor part. I mean our labor as increase a percentage of revenue was -- one of the ways we track it, Tim, is our expenses growing less fast than our revenue, and that's always a focus for our operations. And labor was -- grew less than that 11% revenue increase.\nTim Mulrooney: No, that's really good color. I appreciate that. Can you remind me what percent of your sales typically fuel represents?\nJulie Bimmerman: Well, we don't break out the fuel specifically. We keep that buried into our fleet number as you well know. So also think about it's not only the fuel increasing, as you said, the $4 million. But we're also talking about the increase because we had fewer vehicle gains this quarter as well, just under $1 million on that as well.\nJohn Wilson: I think in our prepared remarks, Julie said $4 million in increased fuel cost, Tim. And as you know, we've had active routing and scheduling efforts for several years. With 1 million stops per month or more, without that effort and the reduced miles per stop that our field teams are achieving, it would have been worse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nMario Cortellacci: Just kind of piggybacking off of the margin part of it. Maybe you can just give us a sense for how pricing is running right now. I think last quarter, you guys said that you could flex it up above the 1% to 2% historical range to help offset some of the cost pressures. But is there any lag in there, like the fuel side of the equation? The receivable? Or the fleet side of the equation? Or is the pricing running hot and just helping offset maybe some of the labor pressures?\nJohn Wilson: So you broke up a little bit on part of that. We've not taken any real extraordinary pricing action as a whole. As we talked about previously, many of our -- the vast majority of our people are paid on a productivity pay plan. So any sort of impact to wage inflation doesn't really reflect. What we do, do is use our call center team and our close rates and our branches to sort of evaluate do we have room in pricing. And then that's been a sort of effort that we've always looked at. But if our close rates in a particular market are trending well above the norm, then that tells us we have room for pricing increasing, no matter that the economic or concerns that are going on, right? And conversely, if it goes the other way, we have the same -- then we would take maybe a different action.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. The call center has a lot of ability to look at data real time and make those adjustments to what they're selling, how they're selling it, what the demand is like and adjusting price based on that. But we also did implement our annual price increase this summer just as our core price increase that helps offset some of those costs. But certainly, the fuel is certainly the most impacted component of that this past quarter.\nMario Cortellacci: And then just more of a housekeeping issue. I guess with the new organic growth disclosure, are you guys going to provide any historical so that we have some context in how things have trended? Or -- and then also, I guess, within the quarter, can you give us any context within how ready and commercial trended relative to the corporate average? Was resi slowing, commercial slowing? Is it continuing to pick up or commercial accelerating? Just any kind of context there would be helpful.\nJulie Bimmerman: Well, basically, it's what we're getting down to the new numbers. We're going to -- we put these new measurements in place from this point on and will be going forward. So as of today, we told you how this growth relates to, obviously, Q3 of last year, so we gave you from that perspective. But we are not planning at this point to go back and give historical numbers. So hopefully, that makes sense from that standpoint.\nMario Cortellacci: And then can you help with the resi and commercial trend within the quarter just so that we can gauge how each is performing?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would say -- this is Jerry. Residential remains strong. I mean it's been real consistent all the way from the pandemic to now, it remains strong. The commercial function appears to have completely rebounded and, again, is doing well. I would probably see some acceleration on the termite side. And so there's really a lot of positive things going on in our termite and ancillary services across the board. And that's been probably a more important growth driver for us in the third quarter. But all are really strong and continue to trend in positive direction.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ashish Sabra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAshish Sabra: Just a follow-up on the resi side. I was wondering if you can talk about the sales momentum coming out of the key summer selling season. And maybe a related question is also on the retention side, how retention has been tracking, particularly again on the resi side with -- like as people relocating post summer as well as return to office?\nJulie Bimmerman: I'll jump in and then you can add anything if you want to. So on the residential side, still very strong. As we said, we were sitting there with an 11.7% increase over Q3 of last year. And just to bring you around that, if you think about it, last summer, we still had a 10.5% increase on our resi. So residential was -- we did not see a decline last year like many businesses did or like we did on our commercial side. So the level -- that double-digit increase was on top of the double-digit increase last year. So from that standpoint, it is still running very strong. On the -- we have not seen any strong fluctuations on our retention this quarter. Is there anything else, John or Jerry, you would like to add to that?\nJohn Wilson: No. Frankly, Ashish, I've been a little bit surprised and pleased in our team's ability to handle the load that we've put on them with the new customer influx over the summer and the increasing customers that we added over this last year. Our 2 primary measurements are customer sat for the near term or the medium term. And then our customer retention is more of a lagging indicator. And both have remained relatively steady.\nAshish Sabra: That's very helpful color and good to hear that. Maybe if I can just ask a question on the technology rollout. I was wondering if you could provide an update on how the Phase 1 and 2 are progressing and as well as the timing of the launch for Phase 3 and 4.\nJohn Wilson: Do you want to handle that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I can. This is Jerry. So we are very heavily focused on adoption in the field of the phases that we're in and different operations in the field or different phases of -- or different, I guess, maturity levels of adoption. John often describes it like a baseball game and what inning we're in. And we're still -- there's still an awful lot of upside there for us to drive utilization. And with this increase that we're seeing in fuel, there's a lot more desire to get that done and increase the adoption along the way. So we still have plenty of runway in that regard to doing that. And we're continuing to see incremental improvements. And that's what we're all about is continuous improvement and getting better all the time. But we still have a long way to go.\nJulie Bimmerman: And I'll just back to John's analogy that Jerry referenced to on the baseball is we said that we're still in the early sides of the game, early\nJerry Gahlhoff: The early sides of the game?\nJulie Bimmerman: Sorry, the early innings, early innings.\nJerry Gahlhoff: They must think we're playing football.\nJulie Bimmerman: Well, okay.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Just an inning. It's okay.\nJohn Wilson: Yes, well\nJohn Wilson: Go ahead.\nAshish Sabra: Sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Wilson: What I might add to that, our field leaders have adopted a sort of a mantra of, \"You bought it, now utilize it.\" So we've got a ton of technology that our IT team has done a great job in delivering to our end users. And we're really kind of pushing the mindset if you bought it, you're paying for it, now let's use it. And so that's what we're really working on in 2021.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Hoffman: John and Jerry, Julie, and to pass on my best to Gary, rehab is challenging. On the organic growth, can you help us understand what's in it then? As you think about -- if you took [9.2%] and so it\u2019s approximately excess new customers, excess price, excess cross-selling?\nJulie Bimmerman: It's very similar to what it was in the past. So I think just on very broad average, 1% to 2% would be the price increase. And then we do say the rest is a combination of new customers with additional sales to existing customers. We don't break out that part, but just take out your price increase.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then on price, you've historically had a fuel surcharge, if I remember correctly. So are you\nJohn Wilson: Michael, this is John. We've never added a fuel surcharge. Well, I said never. We may have at one time and found out that it really takes our customers off -- And so then what do you do when it goes down and you have to get that back. So I shouldn't say never. But we may have one time, but we found out really quickly how that made our customers feel.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Then I stand corrected. And so how are you going to offset this inflation then?\nJohn Wilson: The inflation of fuel, additional fuel?\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, the fleet cost. The fleet cost pressure, how are you going to offset it?\nJohn Wilson: Well, we'll keep pursuing the same mission we have with reducing miles were stop. And rounding our people more efficiently and as we add new customers then we of course improve gently. \nJulie Bimmerman: Yes. I was just going to expand on what John said. It just gets back to what we were talking about a few minutes ago is, literally, I mean, think about it, if we are in the early innings, did I say that correctly guys, early innings on the on our routing and scheduling and what we can bring in and lowering those miles per stop, I mean, we have a long -- now I'm going to change analogies here, I won't say a long runway, that would totally kill it with it. We have a long way to go on that. So this will definitely help offset, as John was saying, the fuel increases.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then lastly, where does Wildlife exist in the 3 line items, just so we understand what it's influencing.\nJulie Bimmerman: It will be in whichever line item it occurs. The majority of the Wildlife would be on the residential.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Right. But if it was a commercial customer that needed that service, say, a grocery store, it would hit commercial. But if it was a residential homeowner, it would hit residential.\nJulie Bimmerman: I'm just very familiar with it because I've used our Wildlife service before, flying squirrel.\nJerry Gahlhoff: So it's going to -- it would be a mix of those. But the majority of their business is certainly residential.\nJulie Bimmerman: Michael, I just want to make one comment just so you know. That is the way we have always presented the Wildlife. So that is nothing new on how we do split that.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. Just needed to understand since you were emphasizing it, which part was being influenced by it.\nOperator: Okay. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better as well as improve our customers' experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update on our fourth quarter and year-end call. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Our earnings release discussions -- or sorry, discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that will be made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, Jerry. As we measure our performance and think about how to best articulate Rollins' business in the future, along with what routine questions we received from the investment community, we will now be presenting 3 additional measurements quarterly moving forward. The first is a measure we have referred to periodically and that is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Due to our consistent high volume of acquisitions and hence, high amortization expense related to these acquisitions, presenting EBITDA regularly will provide a clearer picture of our operation's ongoing financial performance. Think about this, over the last 3 years, we have averaged 30 acquisitions per year. Next, we will begin presenting our revenue growth through both constant exchange rate and actual exchange rate. By utilizing historical baseline revenues for acquisitions betted through the due diligence process, we were able to include all acquisitions within the calculations, both stand-alone and tuck-in. This will bring clarity and consistency to both our acquisition and our organic revenue growth measurements. Third, we'll be providing you with our free cash flow. We believe that this will properly illustrate Rollins' strong ability to generate cash. We have taken a simple approach to defining free cash flow, which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of equipment and property. Our hope is that these measurements will enable investors to better assess our operating performance in the future and provide a deeper view of our business. We have included GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on each of these metrics on our earnings press release published this morning. So on to the numbers. Our third quarter revenues of $650.2 million was an increase of 11.4% over last year. Of the 11.4% actual exchange rate revenue growth, acquisition growth was 2.2% and organic equated to 9.2%. For the constant exchange rate, the growth percentages calculated within the hundreds of the actual exchange growth rate, therefore, presented the same. For the 9 months ended September 2021, revenues of $1.824 billion was an increase of 12.12 percentage over year-to-date 2020. Of this actual exchange rate, total revenue growth of 2 -- or excuse me, of 12.2%, 2.7% was related to acquisitions and 9.5% organic growth. The constant year-to-date exchange rate total revenue growth for 2021 equaled 11.6%, 2.7% represented acquisitions and 8.9% organic revenue growth. As Jerry pointed out, residential, commercial and termite all grew double digits this quarter over the same quarter last year. So in determining my focus for today, I decided to take Jerry's lead and discuss Wildlife, yet I'm discussing specifically company-owned Wildlife operations. For the third quarter in 2021, Wildlife revenues grew 24.1% over last year. And year-to-date, Wildlife has presented an overall revenue growth of 27.6%. What makes this particularly impressive is that this is after their strong growth of 20.4% last year. So similar to our residential pest control, Wildlife did not feel a negative impact to revenue growth during the pandemic. So way to go to the Wildlife team. Now on to our income. For the third quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the onetime super busting of our late Chairman stock grant in the third quarter of 2020 and the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties in the first 6 months of 2021. The third quarter 2021 EBITDA was $150.9 million or 8.7% over 2020 third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $138.9 million. Third quarter 2021 EPS was $0.19 per diluted share or 5.6% improvement over the 2020 third quarter adjusted EPS. For the 9 months ended September 2021, our adjusted EBITDA was $421.2 million or 22.1% over last year's adjusted EBITDA of $344.9 million. Year-to-date, 2021 adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share or 26.2% over last year. For the third quarter 2021, gross margin increased to 53% or 0.4% over last year. Strong improvements in our materials and supplies were negatively offset by high overall fleet costs, primarily from an increase in fuel of approximately $4 million over third quarter 2020 and lower vehicle gains of $900,000 compared to last year. Sales, general and administrative third quarter margin increase over last year was strongly impacted by the PPE donations and the SEC accrual previously mentioned by John. Travel expenses have also increased $1.3 million in the third quarter as we have begun to lift our company travel restrictions. Amortization expenses for the third quarter 2021 increased $1.4 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from multiple acquisitions. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation of $201,000 due to the sale of owned vehicles and centralizing of IT function. Overall, this equated to a 5.1% increase in depreciation and amortization over the third quarter 2020. Our dividends paid year-to-date 2021 was $119.7 million or an increase of 30.4% over last year. We ended the current period with $117.7 million in cash, of which $73.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. So this brings us to the final of our new 3 measurements, free cash flow. For the third quarter of 2021, our free cash flow was $72.9 million or a decrease of 27.5% over the same quarter last year. For the 9 months ended 2021, our free cash flow equals $278.9 million or 13.6% decrease over year-to-date 2020. This fluctuation occurred due to the deferral of $30.3 million in FICA taxes payable in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act. These associated taxes were then remitted in September of 2021. We hope that the discussion of these new measurements, you will receive a greater clarity while reviewing our financial performance. Lastly, I want to discuss that yesterday, we were extremely pleased to announce that our Board has approved a 25% increase to our dividend. The quarterly dividend increased $0.10 -- to $0.10 per share from $0.08 per share and will be paid on December 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2021. Additionally, the Board also approved a special dividend of $0.08 to be paid on December 10, 2021, as well. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and underscores our financial strength, our solid capital position and the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. John, I'll turn it back to you. No, we did not. We just gave the organic on the overall. At this point, with our change, we're trying to give you additional clarity by giving a very clean organic and the acquisition growth numbers. So we will be staying for here for now. Yes, 100%. All acquisitions are excluded. I'm going to go ahead and kick this first to Jerry, and then I'll see if I want to add anything on to that. Well, we don't break out the fuel specifically. We keep that buried into our fleet number as you well know. So also think about it's not only the fuel increasing, as you said, the $4 million. But we're also talking about the increase because we had fewer vehicle gains this quarter as well, just under $1 million on that as well. Well, basically, it's what we're getting down to the new numbers. We're going to -- we put these new measurements in place from this point on and will be going forward. So as of today, we told you how this growth relates to, obviously, Q3 of last year, so we gave you from that perspective. But we are not planning at this point to go back and give historical numbers. So hopefully, that makes sense from that standpoint. I'll jump in and then you can add anything if you want to. So on the residential side, still very strong. As we said, we were sitting there with an 11.7% increase over Q3 of last year. And just to bring you around that, if you think about it, last summer, we still had a 10.5% increase on our resi. So residential was -- we did not see a decline last year like many businesses did or like we did on our commercial side. So the level -- that double-digit increase was on top of the double-digit increase last year. So from that standpoint, it is still running very strong. On the -- we have not seen any strong fluctuations on our retention this quarter. Is there anything else, John or Jerry, you would like to add to that? And I'll just back to John's analogy that Jerry referenced to on the baseball is we said that we're still in the early sides of the game, early Sorry, the early innings, early innings. Well, okay. It's very similar to what it was in the past. So I think just on very broad average, 1% to 2% would be the price increase. And then we do say the rest is a combination of new customers with additional sales to existing customers. We don't break out that part, but just take out your price increase. Yes. I was just going to expand on what John said. It just gets back to what we were talking about a few minutes ago is, literally, I mean, think about it, if we are in the early innings, did I say that correctly guys, early innings on the on our routing and scheduling and what we can bring in and lowering those miles per stop, I mean, we have a long -- now I'm going to change analogies here, I won't say a long runway, that would totally kill it with it. We have a long way to go on that. So this will definitely help offset, as John was saying, the fuel increases. It will be in whichever line item it occurs. The majority of the Wildlife would be on the residential. I'm just very familiar with it because I've used our Wildlife service before, flying squirrel. Michael, I just want to make one comment just so you know. That is the way we have always presented the Wildlife. So that is nothing new on how we do split that."

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue increased 11.4% to $650.2 million compared to $583.7 million for the third quarter of last year. Our net income totaled $93.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $79.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. Revenues for the first 9 months of 2021 were $1.824 billion, an increase of 12.2% compared to $1.625 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased 44% to $285.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $198.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 11.7% and termite presenting 15% growth over the third quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation, delivered an impressive 10.1% growth over the third quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 7.9% growth over 2 years ago when we were not experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. Overall, we are pleased with our performance. Rollins remains well positioned for the remainder of the year and into 2022 Looking deeper at our operating results, we're attracting customers to all our services and brands. And one area I'd like to focus on today is our continued strong growth in our wildlife service offerings. Trutech Wildlife joined the Rollins family in 2010, followed by Critter Control in 2015. Since 2010, the business has grown 800%. Day-to-day operations of operating a wildlife control business is quite different than running a typical pest and termite business, and we are proud to have a dedicated team focused on this much needed service. Originally concentrated in the Southeastern United States, the business has expanded across the nation as well as into Canada. And with Critter Control's expansion into Canada, it's Rollins' first brand to enter an international country without acquiring another business as a platform. The Wildlife division also operates a thriving franchise system. There are currently 84 franchises with the most recent franchise launching in Mansfield, Ohio. We anticipate finishing the year with 12 new franchises, one of our strongest years in adding franchisees. We have also been fortunate to add 9 former corporate employees as franchisees, employees who have an entrepreneurial drive and a passion for wildlife and customer service have multiple career path opportunities, be it ownership of the franchise or growth within our company. We believe there is meaningful opportunity for continued growth in our Wildlife business and look forward to updating you in the quarters ahead. I'd now like to discuss Hurricane Ida. Our hearts go out to our Gulf Coast region and those that were affected by the hurricane. But I must admit we are inspired by our team in that area. They implemented an amazing plan that helped our team members and alleviate the negative impact of the storm. I have shut down several of our branches for days, but 2 locations were shut down for about 2 weeks. The impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business in the quarter. Thankfully, all of our employees in the area were safe, yet they did need assistance. Through the Rollins Employee Relief Fund, we granted 137 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first week following the hurricane to enable employees to address their personal essential needs. Since then, another 7 employees who endured greater hardships received full grants to address their more significant needs. Additionally, our Orkin South Central division, led by Leland Morris, quickly initiated a preparedness and mitigation plan to assist our team members. This included immediate procurement of much needed supplies for our employees and their families, such as generators, fuel, portable air conditioners, fans, water and other essential emergency provisions that were not readily accessible to them locally. Our team members in adjacent areas that were fortunate to avoid the brunt of Ida's force volunteered their time and energy, often after work hours, to load these supplies into box trucks and drive them to those most in need. For weeks, they continue to shuttle fuel to these employees to keep their generators up and running. This was a total team effort, and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to one another. In fact, we're so pleased with their effort that we plan to expand and formalize this program in other areas of the country so that we can rapidly respond in case of a natural disaster or emergency. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials. The biggest headwind we had, Tim, this is Jerry, in the quarter, was fuel prices. Fuel expense was up significantly. We were able to manage the labor part pretty well. From -- as a percentage of revenue, labor wasn't as big of a deal. So we just had higher fleet expenses probably more than anything. John, what would you add to that? Anything? Yes. The call center has a lot of ability to look at data real time and make those adjustments to what they're selling, how they're selling it, what the demand is like and adjusting price based on that. But we also did implement our annual price increase this summer just as our core price increase that helps offset some of those costs. But certainly, the fuel is certainly the most impacted component of that this past quarter. I would say -- this is Jerry. Residential remains strong. I mean it's been real consistent all the way from the pandemic to now, it remains strong. The commercial function appears to have completely rebounded and, again, is doing well. I would probably see some acceleration on the termite side. And so there's really a lot of positive things going on in our termite and ancillary services across the board. And that's been probably a more important growth driver for us in the third quarter. But all are really strong and continue to trend in positive direction. I can. This is Jerry. So we are very heavily focused on adoption in the field of the phases that we're in and different operations in the field or different phases of -- or different, I guess, maturity levels of adoption. John often describes it like a baseball game and what inning we're in. And we're still -- there's still an awful lot of upside there for us to drive utilization. And with this increase that we're seeing in fuel, there's a lot more desire to get that done and increase the adoption along the way. So we still have plenty of runway in that regard to doing that. And we're continuing to see incremental improvements. And that's what we're all about is continuous improvement and getting better all the time. But we still have a long way to go. The early sides of the game? They must think we're playing football. Just an inning. It's okay. Right. But if it was a commercial customer that needed that service, say, a grocery store, it would hit commercial. But if it was a residential homeowner, it would hit residential. So it's going to -- it would be a mix of those. But the majority of their business is certainly residential."

            "name": "John Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our third quarter 2021 conference call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we will begin. Thank you, Julie. Before we begin, I am sure you have noticed that Gary is not on today's conference call. He is actively rehabbing from a knee replacement operation. And while he is recovering quickly, he is doing very well. He's just not in a position to physically join us today. We wish Gary well with his physical therapy and look forward to having him rejoin us on future calls. During the third quarter, we achieved some very strong business results, and Jerry will go over those with you shortly. In the interim, I wanted to share news of the latest addition to our Rollins Board of Directors. As you already know, over the previous year, we have enhanced and diversified that group with several new members. I am very pleased to announce our latest addition is Rollins' President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Gahlhoff. This is in recognition of his strong leadership and his deep commitment to the company's long-term success. We are proud to have Jerry serving on our Board moving forward. Jerry is an important part of the Rollins leadership team, and his in-depth knowledge of our business and experience gained from working in our industry since 1991 adds perspective. We're fortunate to have him assume a greater role in the direction and future of our company. Before turning the call over to Jerry, I have 2 items to first update you on. The first will represent a recent development in Rollins' environmental, social and governance commitment. We take very seriously the responsibility that we have to the communities in which we work and live. As a recent example, we're pleased to share that Rollins has made an in-kind donation originally costing $4.6 million worth of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, items during the third quarter. Working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and several philanthropic organizations, including the Friends of Disabled Adults and Children, the Foundation of Hope Food Bank as well as Cope Preparedness in Los Angeles, we donated 27 pallets or 6.8 million pieces of masks, gloves and other items. In addition to achieving the successful execution of our strategies as well as solid business results, we also have a responsibility to the communities in which we work and live. EFC is a facet of our business is becoming more and more important to us. We are proud to support these initiatives. Last, as we have previously disclosed, the company has been responding to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with accounting standard ASC 450, we have established a reserve related to this matter, which we consider immaterial. Given that the investigation is ongoing, we cannot answer any questions during our Q&A, but we remain focused on resolving this inquiry. With that, I will turn our call over to Jerry. Thank you, Julie. We are happy to take any questions at this time. Yes. I would second the labor part. I mean our labor as increase a percentage of revenue was -- one of the ways we track it, Tim, is our expenses growing less fast than our revenue, and that's always a focus for our operations. And labor was -- grew less than that 11% revenue increase. I think in our prepared remarks, Julie said $4 million in increased fuel cost, Tim. And as you know, we've had active routing and scheduling efforts for several years. With 1 million stops per month or more, without that effort and the reduced miles per stop that our field teams are achieving, it would have been worse. So you broke up a little bit on part of that. We've not taken any real extraordinary pricing action as a whole. As we talked about previously, many of our -- the vast majority of our people are paid on a productivity pay plan. So any sort of impact to wage inflation doesn't really reflect. What we do, do is use our call center team and our close rates and our branches to sort of evaluate do we have room in pricing. And then that's been a sort of effort that we've always looked at. But if our close rates in a particular market are trending well above the norm, then that tells us we have room for pricing increasing, no matter that the economic or concerns that are going on, right? And conversely, if it goes the other way, we have the same -- then we would take maybe a different action. No. Frankly, Ashish, I've been a little bit surprised and pleased in our team's ability to handle the load that we've put on them with the new customer influx over the summer and the increasing customers that we added over this last year. Our 2 primary measurements are customer sat for the near term or the medium term. And then our customer retention is more of a lagging indicator. And both have remained relatively steady. Do you want to handle that? Yes, well Go ahead. What I might add to that, our field leaders have adopted a sort of a mantra of, \"You bought it, now utilize it.\" So we've got a ton of technology that our IT team has done a great job in delivering to our end users. And we're really kind of pushing the mindset if you bought it, you're paying for it, now let's use it. And so that's what we're really working on in 2021. Michael, this is John. We've never added a fuel surcharge. Well, I said never. We may have at one time and found out that it really takes our customers off -- And so then what do you do when it goes down and you have to get that back. So I shouldn't say never. But we may have one time, but we found out really quickly how that made our customers feel. The inflation of fuel, additional fuel? Well, we'll keep pursuing the same mission we have with reducing miles were stop. And rounding our people more efficiently and as we add new customers then we of course improve gently. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. As you've heard during the past calls, we have several programs underway that will make our company better as well as improve our customers' experience and our financial results. We look forward to giving you an update on our fourth quarter and year-end call. Thanks again."

Don, having worked for many years in investment in commercial banking, including Wachovia Bank, brings a high level of knowledge and strategic financial transactions to the company. We're thrilled to add these individuals to the outstanding group of leaders on our Board, and we look forward to their counsel and contributions to our company. Now I will turn the call over to Jerry to provide an overview of the strong quarter just completed.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thanks, John. And good morning, everybody. As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand. For those who have followed us over the years, you may recall that Orkin was acquired by Rollins in 1964 and as the original company that first started our venture into pest control. Today, Orkin remains our largest brand, employing over 8,000 team members and completing millions of services annually worldwide. Orkin is very involved in the communities they serve, maintaining a strong commitment to education, public health and environmental responsibility. From collaborations with the centers for disease control and prevention and major universities to their work with the National Science Teachers Association, Orkin fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world around us. As we have previously shared with you over the past few years, Orkin has adopted new technologies, which has improved communications with customers, optimized routing and scheduling and increased technician efficiencies to name a few. Through the years, Orkin has grown, adding both new customers and new customer service offerings like bed bug, flea and tick, mosquito and most recently, VitalClean, our service designed to fight COVID-19. Overall, Orkin has significantly contributed to the long-term success of Rollins. As Gary mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 15.3% to $63.2 million compared to $553.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Net income grew to $98.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $75.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 13.6% and termite 16.3% over second quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation delivered an impressive 17.4% growth over second quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 11.3% growth over 2 years ago when we weren't experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. As you may recall, last year, we thought it was prudent to forgo our annual price increase during the pandemic. Now encouraged by the economic recovery that's underway, we have rolled out our 2021 annual price increases at all our brands. Implemented at the end of the second quarter, we expect that we will see the benefits of these increases as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Additionally, we're especially pleased with our commercial pest control growth, which has not only benefited from the economy reopening, but also from our InSite commercial technology. Through the use of InSite, Orkin's web reporting tool, our commercial customers have the ability to monitor pest activity and treatments within their facilities, reduce service tickets and receive specific pest alert notifications. This allows for quality assurance checks to be easily completed at the customer level. It also gives the customer the ability to produce timely reporting as necessary for regulatory or third party audits. We get great feedback from customers on InSite and are confident that this feature will strengthen our relationships with commercial clients. Overall, we've made strong progress during the first six months of 2021. And as we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and profitability in our business. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would like to recognize that the significant financial gains from this quarter are on top of the strong gains that we experienced during 2020. Even as we were all entering a different economic time back in Q2 of last year, our revenue grew at a steady 5.6%. That was converted into net income growth of 17.2%. Both of these 2020 numbers were at or above our historic averages. So for the second quarter 2021, as Jerry noted, all business lines presented strong revenue growth. Keys to the quarter included pricing strength, positively impacting revenue growth, continued mosquito service revenue improvement over 30% and commercial pest control revenue improving significantly. Additionally, for the first time, our mosquito service revenue has surpassed our bedbug revenue in this quarter was over 3% of our total revenue. Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $638.2 million was an increase of 15.3% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $553.3 million. Our income before income taxes was $133.9 million, or 29.4% above 2020. Our net income was $98.9 million, up 31.2% compared to 2020. Our earnings per share were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in 2020, or a 33.3% increase. As a reminder, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP results were positively impacted by our gain on sales of several of our properties. For the first six months of 2021, revenues were $1.174 billion, which was an increase of 12.7% over the prior year's first six months revenue of $1.014 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $253.8 million or 59.7% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $191.5 million or 61.4%, compared to 2020. Our GAAP EPS or earnings per were $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in 2020. Overall, like some companies that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, demand in most areas of our business in both 2020 and 2021 was strong. We maintained consistent revenue growth of 5.6% in 2020, followed by a healthy increase of 15.3% in 2021. It does not seem that pent up demand or stimulus checks have impacted our residential revenue growth, but rather a new awareness of pest needs based on more time spent at the home. It would be difficult to predict what these new demand levels will look like in the future, but we remain optimistic. Our total revenue increased for the quarter, up 15.3% and included 1.7% from significant acquisitions with the remaining 13.6% from pricing and new customer growth. Residential pest control made up 40% of our revenue; commercial pest control, 33%; and termite and other services made up approximately 21% of our revenue. In addition, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue less significant acquisitions, was up 13.6%. From that, residential was up 12.3%; commercial, excluding fumigation, increased 14.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 14.9%. In total, our gross margin decreased to 53.3% from 53.8% in the prior year's quarter. Improvements were made in total payroll but were negatively offset by higher overall fleet costs and a write-down of inventory of $2.7 million related to our PPE, or personal protective equipment. We will continue to assess our fluctuating future needs and market value for our PPE in the coming quarters. In addition to our continued Orkin US mileage savings, our Orkin Canada and Western Pest brands are making progress regarding their BOSS and routing and scheduling implementation. Each company has improved their on-day and on-time delivery since the project started. These savings will help support improvements in our overall fleet cost in the future quarters. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.4 million to $23.3 million, an increase of 6.3%. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.3 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Service in December 2020 and Adams Pest in Australia in July of last year. Sales, general and administrative expenses presented a 7.1% improvement for the quarter over 2020, decreasing from 30.9% of revenues to 28.7% of revenues in 2021. The quarter produced savings in administrative and sales salaries and benefits, as well as telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. As for our cash position, for the six months ending 6/30/2021, we spent $28.4 million on acquisitions compared to $56 million in the same period last year. We paid $79.7 million on dividends and had $13.2 million of CapEx compared to $12.4 million in 2020. We ended the period with $128.5 million in cash, of which $73.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Before I close out, I would like to mention our recent press release, where Rollins was named to the top 50 green fleet list as pushed by Automotive Fleets 2021 ranking. As part of our continuous improvement that I mentioned in my opening, we have lots of opportunity in the future in this area, but we are proud of this recognition by the industry. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10th, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business August 10th, 2021. Gary, I'll turn it back to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. And we're happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed.\nTim Mulrooney: Gary, John, Jerry, Julie, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions.\nGary Rollins: Good morning.\nJohn Wilson: Good morning.\nTim Mulrooney: So just a real quick housekeeping here. On the residential pest, can you give us those numbers again for total residential pest growth and organic? I think I missed that.\nJulie Bimmerman: Okay.\nGary Rollins: Yes. You got that Julie?\nJulie Bimmerman: Yes. Let me get that for you real quick, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. While you're looking that up, Julie, I'll just ask this next question to the broader group. This is my follow-up question. Last year, around this time, you guys highlighted the record level of new account sales, I think, particularly in residential. And I think that you had many all time record high new sales days throughout the quarter. Can you talk about how new account sales have trended through the second quarter of this year, now a year later? And how that compares to the really strong period that you had during the second quarter of last year? Thank you.\nJohn Wilson: So Tim, this is John Wilson. I'll take a stab at that. Our brand that we best track and that is, of course, Orkin being our largest. And for the second quarter, that continued to be up again this year. But of course, not by near the \u2013 near the same record number, but we are improved over a year ago in new customer accounts.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Okay. Thanks very much. And Julie, were you able to get the residential organic growth and total growth?\nJulie Bimmerman: Okay. Yes. So we're talking about the total growth and that may have [indiscernible] We actually had Jerry talk about the total, then I did talk about the organic, so from that standpoint. So for the quarter, we experienced the growth in residential increasing to 13.6%, the termite 16.3% and the commercial, excluding fume of 17.4%. You're listening?\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Got it. I'm with you.\nJulie Bimmerman: Okay. I just wanted to make sure. And then - not a problem, not a problem. Just bear with me, Tim. This is new for me. And then talking on the organic side for the residential was the 12.3%, commercial, excluding fume 14.8%, and termite at the 14.9%.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, okay. Perfect. Thanks so much, Julie. Thank you everybody\u2026\nJulie Bimmerman: Yes. Thanks, Tim.\nGary Rollins: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. Thank you for the time. I guess maybe just asking Tim's question a slightly different way. I guess how much of your organic growth - or maybe you can help us understand the organic growth build-up this quarter of how much was new customers, how much was cross-sell or new products introduced to existing customers? Was there any improvement on retention that contributed to organic growth as well? And then it sounds like you turned pricing back on, was that still in like the 1% to 2% range for the quarter as well?\nJulie Bimmerman: Okay. I will start on this and then anyone else, if you want to jump in feel free. First of all, on the pricing, we put in our normal price increase that we normally would have. So we did not do something additional because we held the price increase last year. So it would be within the normal ranges in answer to that. As to our retention rate, we have seen a consistent incremental growth on our retention over the last 5 years and still do see that trend continuing this year.\nJohn Wilson: Yes. So I'll add on to that, Mario. This is John Wilson. Pricing amounted to about 1.2%, which is kind of in line with our historic norm of what pricing adds. And the real answer to your question is all of the above. So cross selling had a piece of that, we don't track what that may add. So I don't - I can't give you a number on that. Retention improved, as Julie mentioned. And then, of course, we did have an increase, again, as I mentioned a minute ago with Tim, on our new accounts added.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. Thank you. And then just, I guess, a follow-up on the pricing and maybe whatever inflation that could potentially show up. I have been following you guys as long as some other guys. But I don't know maybe what you've done historically in higher inflation environment. If we do see inflation or wage and labor inflation kind of rear its ugly head for you, would you go above that range, that historical 1% to 2% range, like you did 1.2% this quarter. If you're seeing wages really ramp a lot higher, you're finding it a lot harder to find talent over the following - over the next year, would you kind of flex that pricing up a little higher to offset the increased costs?\nJohn Wilson: Yes. So we could. I mean, the market will, obviously, dictate what we can do. But we've always pointed to our call center that we have is a wonderful laboratory to test what our pricing elasticity is with our various close rates and what we're capable of getting there. So we would absolutely look at that, Mario. Right now, we don't feel a need to, but we'll take a look at it.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. And then just a quick housekeeping, and maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, did you guys disclose or say how many deals you closed in Q2 or year-to-date so far?\nJohn Wilson: I don't know that number.\nJulie Bimmerman: We just gave you the dollars on that.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thanks, Mario.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much. And since the others have focused more on sales, I'm going to focus on cost. So there's a little giveback in gross margin, but a meaningful improvement in SG&A. And on the gross margin, I'm trying to understand, is there not wage inflation as well versus - or is that embedded in fleet? And then on the SG&A, can you sustain less than 29% of revs from this point forward, given where you are?\nJulie Bimmerman: Hey, Michael. So within the gross margin, we did - I mean, we actually did see an improvement in our total payroll in answer to that. So overall, you've got to remember that technicians are directly tied with the work that they're producing. So their wages are tied to - at the - when they go through and complete their jobs, if you recall on that front. As far as the fleet cost, the fleet cost, yes, as you know, we did have an increase in that, and that was improved predominantly within the fuel [ph].\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then the G&A?\nJulie Bimmerman: On the G&A side, as you said, though, we definitely saw some SG&A improvements over the same quarter last year. And it was really administrative in sales salaries, and then also with our new contracts for our telephone that we were able to work on some better pricing.\nJerry Gahlhoff: This is Jerry, Michael. The other thing I would say is we've been very careful about adding costs back into our business over the past year. We made some changes in our business a year ago. And from an operations standpoint, we've been very careful about what we're adding back in terms of our cost structure. So - and a lot of that has to do with our - controlling our overhead expenses.\nGary Rollins: Well, on revenue and schedule, and this is Gary. Certainly, has given us an opportunity to get more done. And as Julie said, the vast majority of our pest control technicians are on a productivity pay plan. So as they do more, they make more and that helps with turnover reduction. So all those elements are coming together fortunately.\nMichael Hoffman: Terrific. And then my follow-up, you released a supplemental 8-K after the earnings release and made reference to an SEC investigation. Have they completed that because they never tell you when they're completing it? So can you tell us if they completed it?\nJohn Wilson: Yes. Michael. So I think the 8-K referred is that it's ongoing, and it is ongoing. It is not completed, no.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached - we do have a follow-up question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed.\nTim Mulrooney: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask about your virus side spend term [ph] because this is a topic across my services coverage universe. I know virus side spend has been elevated across your customer base, as folks are still highly sensitive to the issues of hygiene in virus protection. But with vaccination rates on the rise, I would assume that this offering would moderate over time. So am I right about that? Can you talk a little bit about demand for your virus side offering and how that's trending?\nJerry Gahlhoff: My best. This is Jerry, Tim. My best barometer [ph] that is talking to Freeman Elliott at Orkin. And while we have seen it moderate, I think that's the right term. There is also places where there is demand, still where people are coming back to office spaces and people are still concerned about their workers being in there and want that kind of disinfection service still occurring. So it's still there. Some markets are better than others where they've returned more people to the offices and things like that. So it's still a viable business, although, to your point, it has moderated.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. And while you got me here, maybe I'll try to squeeze one more in, but thanks for the color on that, Jerry. I wanted to ask about your M&A pipeline, and this is like big picture. So how would you say your pipeline looks today compared to say 5 years ago? Is it smaller given how much consolidation we've seen over the last 5 years? Or is it the other way? Is it larger because more pest control companies are emerging every day? Really curious how you all would characterize the M&A pipeline relative to 5, 10 years ago?\nJohn Wilson: Yes, Tim, so this is John. I'll take a stab at that at the start and maybe Jerry can add to it. I've used the word frothy in the past, and I think it's still that way. Our pipeline is - I would - I don't have that number from 5 years ago, but I would guess it's similar. And a big driver of late has been contemplated tax changes coming out of Washington, D.C., whether it's to you know, state taxes or whatever. And so some of that's driving some of the conversations that we've had. So Jerry, if you have anything to add to that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. We're still seeing plenty of deals looking at things and evaluating what makes sense to us at an appropriate price. So we still have plenty of action going on there.\nJulie Bimmerman: Okay. And let me jump on to that real quick, and this actually goes back to, I think, it was Mario's question. We have closed 18 deals through the end of Q2.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color, everybody\u2026\nJulie Bimmerman: And I do want to throw one other thing out there. Jerry just put a note in front of me. It sounds like when I said that residential pest control made up, I believe, I said 40% of our revenues, that is incorrect. It is 46% of our revenue. So\u2026 \nJerry Gahlhoff: I can't believe you're understating it.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. And look forward to reporting in October, our third quarter results and updating you on our progress. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Thank you, Jerry. At Rollins, we are constantly looking for ways to improve in all areas of our business. As many of you know, continuous improvement is an important part of our culture. We have a lot of opportunity for the remainder of 2021. But I would like to recognize that the significant financial gains from this quarter are on top of the strong gains that we experienced during 2020. Even as we were all entering a different economic time back in Q2 of last year, our revenue grew at a steady 5.6%. That was converted into net income growth of 17.2%. Both of these 2020 numbers were at or above our historic averages. So for the second quarter 2021, as Jerry noted, all business lines presented strong revenue growth. Keys to the quarter included pricing strength, positively impacting revenue growth, continued mosquito service revenue improvement over 30% and commercial pest control revenue improving significantly. Additionally, for the first time, our mosquito service revenue has surpassed our bedbug revenue in this quarter was over 3% of our total revenue. Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $638.2 million was an increase of 15.3% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $553.3 million. Our income before income taxes was $133.9 million, or 29.4% above 2020. Our net income was $98.9 million, up 31.2% compared to 2020. Our earnings per share were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in 2020, or a 33.3% increase. As a reminder, we reported both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP results were positively impacted by our gain on sales of several of our properties. For the first six months of 2021, revenues were $1.174 billion, which was an increase of 12.7% over the prior year's first six months revenue of $1.014 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $253.8 million or 59.7% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $191.5 million or 61.4%, compared to 2020.

As Orkin begins their 120th year of service, we thought it was an opportune time to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the recent successes of the brand. For those who have followed us over the years, you may recall that Orkin was acquired by Rollins in 1964 and as the original company that first started our venture into pest control. Today, Orkin remains our largest brand, employing over 8,000 team members and completing millions of services annually worldwide. Orkin is very involved in the communities they serve, maintaining a strong commitment to education, public health and environmental responsibility. From collaborations with the centers for disease control and prevention and major universities to their work with the National Science Teachers Association, Orkin fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world around us. As we have previously shared with you over the past few years, Orkin has adopted new technologies, which has improved communications with customers, optimized routing and scheduling and increased technician efficiencies to name a few. Through the years, Orkin has grown, adding both new customers and new customer service offerings like bed bug, flea and tick, mosquito and most recently, VitalClean, our service designed to fight COVID-19. Overall, Orkin has significantly contributed to the long-term success of Rollins. As Gary mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with our results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 15.3% to $63.2 million compared to $553.3 million for the second quarter of last year. Net income grew to $98.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $75.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share for the same period in 2020. Julie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly. For the quarter, we experienced solid growth in all our business lines with residential increasing 13.6% and termite 16.3% over second quarter 2020. Additionally, commercial, excluding fumigation delivered an impressive 17.4% growth over second quarter last year. This is also an improvement of 11.3% growth over 2 years ago when we weren't experiencing COVID-related shutdowns. As you may recall, last year, we thought it was prudent to forgo our annual price increase during the pandemic. Now encouraged by the economic recovery that's underway, we have rolled out our 2021 annual price increases at all our brands. Implemented at the end of the second quarter, we expect that we will see the benefits of these increases as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Additionally, we're especially pleased with our commercial pest control growth, which has not only benefited from the economy reopening, but also from our InSite commercial technology. Through the use of InSite, Orkin's web reporting tool, our commercial customers have the ability to monitor pest activity and treatments within their facilities, reduce service tickets and receive specific pest alert notifications. This allows for quality assurance checks to be easily completed at the customer level. It also gives the customer the ability to produce timely reporting as necessary for regulatory or third party audits. We get great feedback from customers on InSite and are confident that this feature will strengthen our relationships with commercial clients. Overall, we've made strong progress during the first six months of 2021. And as we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and profitability in our business. Now let me turn the call over to Julie to discuss our financials. This is Jerry, Michael. The other thing I would say is we've been very careful about adding costs back into our business over the past year. We made some changes in our business a year ago. And from an operations standpoint, we've been very careful about what we're adding back in terms of our cost structure. So - and a lot of that has to do with our - controlling our overhead expenses. My best. This is Jerry, Tim. My best barometer [ph] that is talking to Freeman Elliott at Orkin. And while we have seen it moderate, I think that's the right term. There is also places where there is demand, still where people are coming back to office spaces and people are still concerned about their workers being in there and want that kind of disinfection service still occurring. So it's still there. Some markets are better than others where they've returned more people to the offices and things like that. So it's still a viable business, although, to your point, it has moderated. Yes. We're still seeing plenty of deals looking at things and evaluating what makes sense to us at an appropriate price. So we still have plenty of action going on there. I can't believe you're understating it."

            "content": "Good morning. Yesterday, our Board of Directors appointed Julie Bimmerman, who many of you know, as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Eddie Northern has been moved into an operational role as Senior Vice President focused on sustainability. Julie has significant experience, both in finance and our industry as described in the press release we issued this morning. She has been with us since 2004, having most recently been Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Prior to joining Rollins, Julie worked in corporate accounting, internal audit and corporate tax audit role. She's known to many of you already and she will be available to analysts and institutional investors after the call as per usual. We also filed an 8-K updating developments in our SEC investigation this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Gary. Thank you, Gary. Over the past year, we have enhanced and diversified Rollins' Board of Directors with several new additions. I'd like to spend a moment today welcoming our two newest Board members, Gregory Morrison and Donald Carson. As detailed in our May press releases, Greg was the former Chief Information Officer, who led the information technology operations for Cox Enterprises, and he will add cyber expertise to our Board. Don, having worked for many years in investment in commercial banking, including Wachovia Bank, brings a high level of knowledge and strategic financial transactions to the company. We're thrilled to add these individuals to the outstanding group of leaders on our Board, and we look forward to their counsel and contributions to our company. Now I will turn the call over to Jerry to provide an overview of the strong quarter just completed. Good morning. So Tim, this is John Wilson. I'll take a stab at that. Our brand that we best track and that is, of course, Orkin being our largest. And for the second quarter, that continued to be up again this year. But of course, not by near the \u2013 near the same record number, but we are improved over a year ago in new customer accounts. Yes. So I'll add on to that, Mario. This is John Wilson. Pricing amounted to about 1.2%, which is kind of in line with our historic norm of what pricing adds. And the real answer to your question is all of the above. So cross selling had a piece of that, we don't track what that may add. So I don't - I can't give you a number on that. Retention improved, as Julie mentioned. And then, of course, we did have an increase, again, as I mentioned a minute ago with Tim, on our new accounts added. Yes. So we could. I mean, the market will, obviously, dictate what we can do. But we've always pointed to our call center that we have is a wonderful laboratory to test what our pricing elasticity is with our various close rates and what we're capable of getting there. So we would absolutely look at that, Mario. Right now, we don't feel a need to, but we'll take a look at it. I don't know that number. Yes. Michael. So I think the 8-K referred is that it's ongoing, and it is ongoing. It is not completed, no. Yes, Tim, so this is John. I'll take a stab at that at the start and maybe Jerry can add to it. I've used the word frothy in the past, and I think it's still that way. Our pipeline is - I would - I don't have that number from 5 years ago, but I would guess it's similar. And a big driver of late has been contemplated tax changes coming out of Washington, D.C., whether it's to you know, state taxes or whatever. And so some of that's driving some of the conversations that we've had. So Jerry, if you have anything to add to that?"

Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Thank you, Julie. Before we get started, you probably noticed that Eddie Northen is not joining us today on the call. John Wilson will share with you more about that now. Now to the exciting news. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter, and we remain well-positioned for 2021. John will share with you our recent additions to our Board of Directors, while Jerry and Julie will give you details of our financial results shortly. These results were made possible by the continued dedication and contribution of our incredible field and corporate teams. We truly appreciate their customer focus that has generated a significantly higher than normal growth and profitability so far in 2021. Now let me turn the call over to John. Thank you, Julie. And we're happy to take your questions at this time. Good morning. Yes. You got that Julie? Thank you. Well, on revenue and schedule, and this is Gary. Certainly, has given us an opportunity to get more done. And as Julie said, the vast majority of our pest control technicians are on a productivity pay plan. So as they do more, they make more and that helps with turnover reduction. So all those elements are coming together fortunately. Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company. And look forward to reporting in October, our third quarter results and updating you on our progress. Thanks, again."

I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964. Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only 2 Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. Randall Rollins was inducted as well. Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. On behalf of the entire Rollins family of employees, thank you, Henry. We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided. I'd also like to acknowledge Lee Crump's recent retirement from Rollins as Chief Information Officer. Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. We wish Lee all the best in his retirement. He's earned it. In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. They truly are our most valuable asset. While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year. Let me now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results. Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials. It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020. Next, I, too, would like to acknowledge the notable impact Mr. Tippie has made, not only on our company but with me, as well. I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus. They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward. We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee. As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. While we have spent the last 6 months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our businesses.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment. Turning to our mosquito service. As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future. Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry. Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands. Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations. Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in 2 additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials.\nEddie Northen: Thank you, Jerry. I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company. For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter. Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020. This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. As we move from what we would call Stage 2 to Stage 3 of our 5-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience. Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021. In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest 3 expense areas. At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: So you had a really strong year last year on the residential side. And I think one of the big questions on everyone's mind is how that might translate to organic growth in 2021. You've got some difficult comparisons coming up over the next several quarters in residential pest. But as I sit back, I'm thinking, then again, we're still largely in a work-from-home environment and I have to think that a lot of the accounts that you signed up last year are probably now finally turning profitable up to the third or fourth visit. So taking all that into account, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the residential side of the business as we continue to emerge from this pandemic.\nEddie Northen: Yes. So Tim, this is Eddie. So we're seeing continued good demand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have overall good weather in the first quarter. Don't know what that will look like as we move throughout the remainder of the year. But I think one of the things that we're seeing, and I think we're all living this in real time is we're seeing more of this hybrid work environment. So it's not only people necessarily working from home. They're not only working from the office, but we're seeing more of this hybrid environment, which we believe is still going to have some eyes that's going to create that demand that we've seen as we move through 2020. You see the numbers here. Our lead generation as we go into Q2 is still very strong for us, and that's starting to lap some of those numbers that you already talked about. So I don't know that any of us know exactly what this will look like as the entire year plays out. But I think there are things that are positive for us to be able to continue to see demand as we're moving forward.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. I appreciate those comments and good color on the lead generation. If I could pivot, I know I think it was Jerry that was talking about the technology that you're implementing BOSS in - or Orkin Canada. I know that's not new news, but I'm not sure I heard about Western before. So just curious if you could give us an update on maybe your technology rollout plans this year. Are there any other \"specialty brands\" that you're planning to roll out BOSS or VRM to any incremental, I guess, technology investments to keep in mind as we model out your expenses for 2021?\nEddie Northen: Yes. I'll answer and then let Jerry follow up from there. So yes, Orkin, we're a little bit further down the path as far as getting things moving more towards maturity. We've added Western to that queue. They're moving down the path of maturity. We'll take a pause at this point in time, make sure that we work through and then we get the benefits from those 2 units or those 2 brands before we were to make a decision or anything else. And we would let you know ahead of time that there was going to be anything significant to change our CapEx as a percent of revenue or anything else like that. But we - I always say, from a modeling standpoint, within the historic range of what we've seen over the last few years, is what our plans are right now. And if we make a decision to change that, we'll let you know what we know about that moving forward.\nGary Rollins: One thing I'd add to that, Eddie, there's technology improvements when we buy another company because typically, they don't have the best phone systems. They're not paying the best rates for communications. And there are some products available within the industry that, in some cases, are upgrades from what they currently have. So although BOSS is certainly important is going to be critical to our future. We are able to help these newly acquired companies with something short of BOSS. And of course, that will be on their plate in the future. Does that help...\nTim Mulrooney: Very helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: I just wanted to ask about organic growth. You guys are using the significant acquisitions verbiage when you're referring to, I guess, organic growth now. Are you able to provide what organic growth looks like, less all acquisitions in resi, commercial and in termite?\nEddie Northen: This is - yes, thanks for that question. So we didn't mean to add confusion here. This is the same way that we've measured it every quarter, probably for the last 15 years. We were just trying to give a little bit of clarity around that part. If we were to - or when we acquire a small tuck-in acquisition of, let's just say, 5 technicians, we acquired them on a Thursday. On a Monday, they have new uniforms, they're in new vehicles, and they're embedded into that Orkin branch. And we really don't have a way for that very small piece to be able to kind of parse that out. So this is - again, this is the same way that we've looked at it every quarter, again, at least for the last 15 years. So we really don't look at it because it's such an insignificant number from that perspective.\nMario Cortellacci: Just - and then maybe a follow-up to that. With those types of acquisitions, is the - are those like $1 million in revenue or like $500,000? Is it that insignificant that it's not even worth mentioning?\nJerry Gahlhoff: That's absolutely correct.\nEddie Northen: Yes. So again, we didn't mean to add confusion to this by wording that we have here. But again, this is the same way we've looked at it throughout time. And nothing else would be a part of it that would be material significant at all.\nMario Cortellacci: Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up would be on the labor market. You guys actually said that you're seeing labor efficiencies and you're seeing, I guess, maybe savings there or coming in better than expected. And I think commentary from other companies is that they're seeing difficulty in hiring new labor, essentially competing with the government for people looking for jobs with stimulus and unemployment checks. Are you seeing anything similar to that within your new hires? And we've also heard that, I guess, smaller pest companies are even offering bonuses to new hires that they sign and then they work for the first 30 days or 60 days or whatever it is and they'll get an additional bonus for staying with them. Are you doing something similar? Or is that really not in the cards for you?\nEddie Northen: Well, when we had demand levels that we've seen this quarter and even if you go back to last quarter that are significantly higher than what we would see on average and any times, it would always be a challenge to ensure that we're finding a hiring and retaining the right employees. The good news for us, and I'll kind of move to specifically your question, the good news for us is as our technology continues to mature on the routing and scheduling part, it enables us to automatically be more efficient. So during my prepared remarks, I talked about, let's just say, a technician that maybe went out with 9 stops in a day and then at 10:00 in the morning, someone called and said, well, they're not going to be available and not be home at 2:00. In our old world, that 2:00 slot basically would have gone empty and the technician would not have had anything to do. In this new world, the branch can see that in real time, our call center can see that in real time. So now when we have a new customer, we can slot a new customer into that time slot. So it's enabling us to continue to be more efficient with that, which is helping with that demand, with the new customer and also being able to move that existing customer as well. So with all that being said, with these demand levels, we are absolutely having issues to be able to go through and make sure that we're finding it and hiring the folks that we need to be able to keep the business moving forward. And HR group and the operations groups are doing a tremendous job with that. But it is a battle with the other companies that are out there that are offering some of the things that you've talked about.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And this is Jerry. John and I recently had a meeting with branch managers in the field at Orkin about your #1 job or your #1 priority as a branch leader is recruiting and building your team. We put a high emphasis that - that's first and foremost, the most important thing you can do. So we place a lot of emphasis and have good processes and procedures behind that. But as Eddie said, it is getting tougher. We do offer referral bonuses, there's a lot of activities on friend and family referrals for new employees, things along those lines that also incentivize people if they get referred and they stay longer, we pay referral bonuses over time, things along those lines. So we take advantage of everything that we can get our hands on to help keep a competitive advantage in the search for talent.\nEddie Northen: But again, this is nothing that's new - I mean, it might be a little bit more heightened at this moment right here, but this is nothing new for us in the service industry. We've gone - just in my time period that I've been here in 6 years, this is something that we're constantly focused on. John set the tone as far as the importance of that. Jerry set the tone as far as the importance of that over time. And we've been able to be successful with that, and we'll find ways to continue to be successful with it as we're moving forward as well.\nGary Rollins: And the other piece of the staffing situation is retention. And we have created in Orkin and in Western and in Canada, we've created a better job. It was very frustrating for that pest control tech to have that cancellation that Eddie just described and really not beginning to unravel the day's route. And now we have the tools that we can move a customer to that slot - a new customer to that slot typically, and he doesn't have or she doesn't have that frustration that how am I going to get through? How am I going to get it done? This has created a mess that ratchets all the way down through the day, et cetera. So it's going to be interesting to see what this does to retention. It has to make a better job for the pest control technician in those areas that have BOSS.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Michael Hoffman of Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: I met Henry Tippie almost at the very beginning of my career 33 years ago when I was covering Rollins Environmental, and he was - gave me sage advice then, which I've always followed in my modeling. So I wish him the best of luck. So the conversation about growth, and I get you're not doing anything different in the language of significant. But double-digit or very high single-digit organic growth in residential relative to the underlying market growth is phenomenal. So what are you doing different that you're producing that type of organic growth versus anybody else in the business because you're clearly gaining share in your well-run company? But what are you doing different, do you think, that allows, even if the comps have to come down because it's so strong last year, you're still gaining share? So what are you doing different?\nEddie Northen: Michael, I think it's a very intuitive question to ask. And trust me, as we've gone through this time of these higher demand levels, we've continued to really drill down into that to get a better understanding. I talked again in my prepared remarks, we did have good weather that we're up against that created. But I think the essential worker status and the seriousness that we took with that, especially as the pandemic started, to me, I think, is one of the things that separated us, for sure, in the service industry, and I would say, separated us within our pest control industry as well. So we already had a very professional technician. As we've talked about previously, we invested in PPE very early on. And when you combine that together with that trusted person that you already have, we believe that, that separated us potentially from others that are out there. We've all had people in different service industries that maybe showed up to do some sort of work that looked disheveled, didn't look professional. And they could have been the best person to be able to do that job that you would hope. But the impression didn't come across positively. And we believe that our technicians across the board in all of our brands come across professionally. And we believe that essential worker status really translated into a trusted brand. And as people have felt more comfortable opening their homes over this last, I'll say, 3, 4, 5 months, we believe that's translated more into a trusted brand, a trusted name, I'm open to them coming into my home and it's really been a reflection of this demand that we've seen that we've been able to go through and grow our business with. So we think that those are a few things. When you couple that with these continued enhancements in the routing and scheduling and how our communication with our customers continues to improve, we believe those are things that continue to separate us from the competition that's out there and enabling us to win on high demand and to retain it at a high rate.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Fair enough. You all updated your corporate presentation recently. By the way, it was a nice change. Had to admit, it took me a moment to realize I was clicking through a book. Just trying to make it rotate a different way. But you put in there about a $12 billion domestic market. And yet the major trade associations defining it as $9.6 billion, growing a little bit less than 3% last year. What's - can you bridge the gap between your market size and PCT's market size?\nEddie Northen: Michael, I have to get those numbers from you. I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to you probably later today or tomorrow. Let us talk to our marketing group and let's see what we can do to help out with the difference between those 2.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're optimistic about Rollins' opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment. Turning to our mosquito service. As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future. Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry. Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands. Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations. Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in 2 additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021. Now let me turn the call over to Eddie to discuss our financials. That's absolutely correct. And this is Jerry. John and I recently had a meeting with branch managers in the field at Orkin about your #1 job or your #1 priority as a branch leader is recruiting and building your team. We put a high emphasis that - that's first and foremost, the most important thing you can do. So we place a lot of emphasis and have good processes and procedures behind that. But as Eddie said, it is getting tougher. We do offer referral bonuses, there's a lot of activities on friend and family referrals for new employees, things along those lines that also incentivize people if they get referred and they stay longer, we pay referral bonuses over time, things along those lines. So we take advantage of everything that we can get our hands on to help keep a competitive advantage in the search for talent."

            "name": "John Wilson",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results. Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials. It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020. Next, I, too, would like to acknowledge the notable impact Mr. Tippie has made, not only on our company but with me, as well. I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus. They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward. We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee. As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. While we have spent the last 6 months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our businesses."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Eddie Northen",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerry. I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company. For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board. As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter. Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020. This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. As we move from what we would call Stage 2 to Stage 3 of our 5-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience. Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter. Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021. In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest 3 expense areas. At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021. Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you. Yes. So Tim, this is Eddie. So we're seeing continued good demand. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have overall good weather in the first quarter. Don't know what that will look like as we move throughout the remainder of the year. But I think one of the things that we're seeing, and I think we're all living this in real time is we're seeing more of this hybrid work environment. So it's not only people necessarily working from home. They're not only working from the office, but we're seeing more of this hybrid environment, which we believe is still going to have some eyes that's going to create that demand that we've seen as we move through 2020. You see the numbers here. Our lead generation as we go into Q2 is still very strong for us, and that's starting to lap some of those numbers that you already talked about. So I don't know that any of us know exactly what this will look like as the entire year plays out. But I think there are things that are positive for us to be able to continue to see demand as we're moving forward. Yes. I'll answer and then let Jerry follow up from there. So yes, Orkin, we're a little bit further down the path as far as getting things moving more towards maturity. We've added Western to that queue. They're moving down the path of maturity. We'll take a pause at this point in time, make sure that we work through and then we get the benefits from those 2 units or those 2 brands before we were to make a decision or anything else. And we would let you know ahead of time that there was going to be anything significant to change our CapEx as a percent of revenue or anything else like that. But we - I always say, from a modeling standpoint, within the historic range of what we've seen over the last few years, is what our plans are right now. And if we make a decision to change that, we'll let you know what we know about that moving forward. This is - yes, thanks for that question. So we didn't mean to add confusion here. This is the same way that we've measured it every quarter, probably for the last 15 years. We were just trying to give a little bit of clarity around that part. If we were to - or when we acquire a small tuck-in acquisition of, let's just say, 5 technicians, we acquired them on a Thursday. On a Monday, they have new uniforms, they're in new vehicles, and they're embedded into that Orkin branch. And we really don't have a way for that very small piece to be able to kind of parse that out. So this is - again, this is the same way that we've looked at it every quarter, again, at least for the last 15 years. So we really don't look at it because it's such an insignificant number from that perspective. Yes. So again, we didn't mean to add confusion to this by wording that we have here. But again, this is the same way we've looked at it throughout time. And nothing else would be a part of it that would be material significant at all. Well, when we had demand levels that we've seen this quarter and even if you go back to last quarter that are significantly higher than what we would see on average and any times, it would always be a challenge to ensure that we're finding a hiring and retaining the right employees. The good news for us, and I'll kind of move to specifically your question, the good news for us is as our technology continues to mature on the routing and scheduling part, it enables us to automatically be more efficient. So during my prepared remarks, I talked about, let's just say, a technician that maybe went out with 9 stops in a day and then at 10:00 in the morning, someone called and said, well, they're not going to be available and not be home at 2:00. In our old world, that 2:00 slot basically would have gone empty and the technician would not have had anything to do. In this new world, the branch can see that in real time, our call center can see that in real time. So now when we have a new customer, we can slot a new customer into that time slot. So it's enabling us to continue to be more efficient with that, which is helping with that demand, with the new customer and also being able to move that existing customer as well. So with all that being said, with these demand levels, we are absolutely having issues to be able to go through and make sure that we're finding it and hiring the folks that we need to be able to keep the business moving forward. And HR group and the operations groups are doing a tremendous job with that. But it is a battle with the other companies that are out there that are offering some of the things that you've talked about. But again, this is nothing that's new - I mean, it might be a little bit more heightened at this moment right here, but this is nothing new for us in the service industry. We've gone - just in my time period that I've been here in 6 years, this is something that we're constantly focused on. John set the tone as far as the importance of that. Jerry set the tone as far as the importance of that over time. And we've been able to be successful with that, and we'll find ways to continue to be successful with it as we're moving forward as well. Michael, I think it's a very intuitive question to ask. And trust me, as we've gone through this time of these higher demand levels, we've continued to really drill down into that to get a better understanding. I talked again in my prepared remarks, we did have good weather that we're up against that created. But I think the essential worker status and the seriousness that we took with that, especially as the pandemic started, to me, I think, is one of the things that separated us, for sure, in the service industry, and I would say, separated us within our pest control industry as well. So we already had a very professional technician. As we've talked about previously, we invested in PPE very early on. And when you combine that together with that trusted person that you already have, we believe that, that separated us potentially from others that are out there. We've all had people in different service industries that maybe showed up to do some sort of work that looked disheveled, didn't look professional. And they could have been the best person to be able to do that job that you would hope. But the impression didn't come across positively. And we believe that our technicians across the board in all of our brands come across professionally. And we believe that essential worker status really translated into a trusted brand. And as people have felt more comfortable opening their homes over this last, I'll say, 3, 4, 5 months, we believe that's translated more into a trusted brand, a trusted name, I'm open to them coming into my home and it's really been a reflection of this demand that we've seen that we've been able to go through and grow our business with.

Michael, I have to get those numbers from you. I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to you probably later today or tomorrow. Let us talk to our marketing group and let's see what we can do to help out with the difference between those 2."

            "name": "Gary Rollins",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2021 conference call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement and disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Thank you, Julie. I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964. Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only 2 Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. Randall Rollins was inducted as well. Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. On behalf of the entire Rollins family of employees, thank you, Henry. We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided. I'd also like to acknowledge Lee Crump's recent retirement from Rollins as Chief Information Officer. Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. We wish Lee all the best in his retirement. He's earned it. In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. They truly are our most valuable asset. While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year. Let me now turn the call over to John. Thank you, Eddie. We're happy to take your questions at this time. One thing I'd add to that, Eddie, there's technology improvements when we buy another company because typically, they don't have the best phone systems. They're not paying the best rates for communications. And there are some products available within the industry that, in some cases, are upgrades from what they currently have. So although BOSS is certainly important is going to be critical to our future. We are able to help these newly acquired companies with something short of BOSS. And of course, that will be on their plate in the future. Does that help... And the other piece of the staffing situation is retention. And we have created in Orkin and in Western and in Canada, we've created a better job. It was very frustrating for that pest control tech to have that cancellation that Eddie just described and really not beginning to unravel the day's route. And now we have the tools that we can move a customer to that slot - a new customer to that slot typically, and he doesn't have or she doesn't have that frustration that how am I going to get through? How am I going to get it done? This has created a mess that ratchets all the way down through the day, et cetera. So it's going to be interesting to see what this does to retention. It has to make a better job for the pest control technician in those areas that have BOSS. Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're optimistic about Rollins' opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thanks again."

These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release, and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that, Rollins closed out last year with continued strong revenue growth and solid financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we report revenue improved 10.2% to $661 million, and net income improvement of 26.1% to $84 million. For all of 2022, we achieved revenue growth of more than 11%, with net income improving as well. Jerry and Ken will provide greater detail, but all credit goes to our tremendous team, who continue to overcome many obstacles. As we begin 2023, the company remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that, we're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm also equally proud of the hard-working men and women of our company that continue to drive our growth through great customer service. I'd like to provide my comments on our 2022 fourth quarter performance. Ken will then address the financials in more detail in a moment. Reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies, Rollins delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, highlighted by total revenue growth of over 10% in the fourth quarter, and over 11% for the full year. Operationally, we have strong momentum in our markets. The company remains well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives, and we're seeing solid levels of growth in the business. As many of you are aware, Rollins has a long-standing company-wide focus on personal safety. Complementing our existing guidelines and protocols we continue to implement new initiatives designed to empower our employees and enable an accountable, safety-driven culture. First training remains crucial for keeping our customers out of harm's way. Second, we're updating incentive metrics and our compensation programs to emphasize safety down to the branch level. A branch manager's bonus plan will now have stronger ties to safety metrics for their operation. We're also working on a new employee-level program to incentivize the highest levels of safe-driving behaviors. We began to pilot this program later this year \u2013 or we plan to pilot this program later this year for our 10000-plus drivers at Rollins. We believe these initiatives will help ensure our workforce returns home to their family, safely each and every day. Looking closer at the financial results and the growth we delivered. Organic growth came in at 6.9% compared with 7.8% for the full year. While still strong, we realized slower growth in the residential sector. While market data indicates this to be consistent across the industry, we started 2023 with strong residential revenue performance in January. While a month is not a long-term trend it was good to see solid demand to start the year. We also continue to succeed in our other service lines particularly within our termite and ancillary, which grew 15.4% year-over-year. Rollins remains very well-positioned to drive ancillary growth within this business. We've taken on the responsibility to educate homeowners on termite prevention and treatment along with other ancillary offerings. And from the customer perspective these service offerings are from a trusted partner. We remain focused on driving revenue growth from cross-selling activities across our large and growing customer base. Our team continues to do a tremendous job here. Our commercial line has also presented a strong year for us with 10.3% growth over the prior year. The sales teams continue to perform very well on both locally sold and national account sales efforts across all our commercial brands. We're seeing strong results in this area with solid performance with customers in the retail, restaurant and office building segments. Across all the service lines I just discussed, a key driver of growth is pricing. During 2022 in light of the ongoing inflationary challenges, we brought forward our annual price increase program to earlier in the year. In 2023, we are bringing this forward even earlier. Most of these price increases will be initiated beginning in early March and some were already implemented in January. Furthermore, our non-Orkin brands are ramping up their focus on pricing the value of our services. Additionally, all our brands are increasing their rate cards. We expect the inflationary environment to persist into 2023 and are focused on managing the price/cost equation. Acquisitions remain a major focus as we start 2023. During 2022 we successfully completed 31 acquisitions representing a total of $119 million invested. This compares with 39 acquisitions and $146 million invested in 2021. While we successfully completed four acquisitions during the fourth quarter we proactively remain on the sidelines during the last few months of 2022 and turned our attention to 2023 deals in our pipeline. We're very optimistic about what's in store for the New Year as leveraging strategic acquisitions remains a focus of our growth strategy. Next, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive efficiency. As part of this we continue to leverage technology by adding a number of new applications to our portfolio of brands. For example, building off our successes with routing and scheduling technology at Orkin and Western Pest Services, we're rolling out routing and scheduling technology initiatives at Clark and HomeTeam. Each of these brands are making meaningful progress at improving efficiency. Clark expects to be at full utilization by the end of this quarter and is very excited about the results to-date. Robert Baker Clark's President went so far as to comment that this initiative is proving to be the best thing for Clark in many years. HomeTeam should complete their implementation and be at full utilization by the end of the second quarter. Both brands have seen an improvement in their on-time delivery metrics since implementation started. In addition to enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner, we found these initiatives can meaningfully reduce both our overall mileage between service visits and drive time for the technician. Not only does this lower our fuel requirements it also has a direct impact on our labor costs. With that, I look forward to answering your questions in a few moments. However, before I turn the call over to Ken I want to emphasize that our team at Rollins had a successful year in 2022 and we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in our business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. \nKenneth Krause: Thank you, Jerry and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter and finish to the year. Let me start with a few highlights. First, revenue growth was healthy with total revenue growing approximately 10% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. Acquisitions drove 3% of revenue growth in the quarter and for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunities that will enable us to continue to drive growth through acquisition in the quarters and years to come. Second, quarterly adjusted EBITDA margins were a healthy 22.1%, up approximately 180 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We saw strong results throughout the income statement. GAAP earnings per share were $0.17, up from $0.14 in the same period a year ago. It was good to see the strong growth in earnings on the healthy revenue growth. And last but not least, quarterly free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 20% versus the same period a year ago. We finished off another strong year with free cash flow growing over 16%. Let's look at the quarterly results in more detail. Quarterly revenue was $661 million, up just over 10% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced quarterly revenue growth by 70 basis points on the stronger dollar notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. Quarterly revenues were strong and it was good to see healthy growth across all of our service lines. Turning to profitability. Gross profit was 50.5% of revenue in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. We saw a good performance on gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. Pricing remains at the top of our agenda and we are evaluating opportunities to implement further price increases in the first quarter of 2023. For the year, we saw elevated costs associated with casualty reserves up $12 million for the year with $10 million of that in the third quarter alone. We discussed these charges with you back in October and continue to focus on implementing a number of key programs that Jerry mentioned previously, that are aimed at improving in this area. Additionally, people costs, most notably medical costs, were up about $7 million for the year. We saw higher costs in this area throughout the year. This wasn't necessarily as impactful in the quarter but was something that gradually got worse throughout the year. SG&A expense in the quarter was $191 million or just under 29% of revenues, up $3 million from the prior year, but improving 230 basis points when stated as a percentage of revenue. It was good to see the improvements in SG&A as a percentage of revenue to finish the year. While lower advertising expense due to timing drove 120 basis points of the leverage, it was good to see cost control carried across a number of categories. Management of SG&A represents a key focus area of ours as we start 2023. At just under 30% of revenue, we feel there are opportunities to drive improvement. Stay tuned on this front but know we are focused on taking action that will help improve performance in this area in years to come. Looking closer at profitability. We did not have any non-GAAP adjustments to operating income or EBITDA this year. GAAP operating income was $120 million or 18.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.1%, up a strong 180 basis points over the prior year adjusted EBITDA margin. As I indicated previously, we did not have any adjustments this year to EBITDA margin. If you recall, we adjusted the prior year quarterly EBITDA margin by the impact of the non-recurring SEC matter. As we discussed on the last call, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. In the quarter, on an as-reported basis, we generated incremental adjusted EBITDA margins that we're approaching 40%. When you take out the lower advertising spend I mentioned previously, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30% for the quarter. And even with incurring the higher casualty charges in the second half, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins for the second half were approaching 30%. This is certainly good to see. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $84 million or $0.17 in adjusted earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong to finish the year. We generated $116 million of free cash flow on $84 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 20% in the quarter and was up a very healthy 16% for the entire year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash was well above 100% for the quarter and the full year. We made acquisitions totaling $9 million and we paid $64 million in dividends during the quarter. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We were in a net cash position to finish the year. Year-to-date we have made acquisitions totaling just over $119 million and paid dividends of approximately $212 million. Debt balances are down $100 million since the beginning of the year and cash is down $10 million finishing at $95 million at the end of 2022. We are actively evaluating options to refinance our credit facilities that are set to expire in April of 2024. We expect to make progress on this in the first quarter. Also during the quarter, we corrected immaterial misstatements in the financial statements. Our press release and our 10-K that we expect to file later today will include more information on these changes. But in summary these are non-cash-related items that reduced what we originally reported for earnings by an immaterial amount. By making this change historical earnings increased by $0.01 per share per year. Let me repeat we understated historical reported earnings by $0.01 per share per year. The immaterial changes are related to purchase accounting for acquisitions. The short of it is that the company allocated too much of the acquired asset value to amortizable intangible assets in the past and this adjustment corrects for this. In closing, our fourth quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust and we are very well positioned to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is very healthy and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us very well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry for closing remarks. Jerry?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: Jerry, Ken, John, Julie good morning.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning.\nKenneth Krause: Good morning.\nJulie Bimmerman: Good morning.\nJohn Wilson: Good morning.\nTim Mulrooney: Just a couple of quick ones for me. So your SG&A as a percentage of sales, it was below 29% in the fourth quarter and it's been coming down every year by a couple of call it 10, 20, 30 sometimes 40 basis points every year. But the fourth quarter below 29% that was below what most folks were anticipating and what we'd typically see from you guys. Are there deliberate cost savings programs happening here, or is it primarily just the leverage that you would expect to get on higher volumes and the savings from advertising expense? What I'm trying to get at is, there was a surprise here at the level of cost savings that you had and you had a nice EBITDA beat primarily because of it. Is it fair to expect to see continued leverage on your fixed costs like this as we move through 2023, or would you expect maybe them to come up a little bit as you layer investments back in the business? Thank you.\nKenneth Krause: Thanks for the question, Tim. This is Ken. I'll take this question. But I would agree with you. We had really good performance in the fourth quarter with respect to our cost control programs and SG&A. As I'd indicated in my prepared commentary, we had an advertising benefit of about $7 million. So that's about 120 basis points of the improvement. However, we certainly continue to look at a number of opportunities to continue to improve our cost structure going forward. We certainly did leverage it with the higher growth rates that we were able to deliver in the quarter, but we also are very actively evaluating and continue to contemplate cost changes and cost reduction measures across our business.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes, Tim, this is Jerry. Since Ken's been here it's one of the hot topics on his radar screen is our SG&A and how can we get better and how can we improve and Ken has challenged us and brought that equation to the table. And as you know we're always looking to get better. And so we're -- and Ken's finding some ways to help us do that. \nTim Mulrooney: Ken's cracking the whip?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Thanks Jerry, and thanks Ken. One more just a question on pricing. I mean it sounds like you're pulling forward the pricing increases even earlier this year which was surprising. But how should we think about that level of pricing increase? I know it was higher than historical levels last year, which makes sense. But with the consumer outlook may be a little bit murkier as we turn the corner into 2023 I'm curious how you're thinking about the level of pricing this year. Do you expect it to be more in line with the historical average, or still above that historical average level? Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff : So, Tim this is Jerry. So on the -- really on the Orkin side, we are looking to very similar levels to what we did in prior year, where we've actually gotten more aggressive in our other brands than we were at prior year. So if anything on the whole the net result of that is what we expect is better performance out of pricing going forward in 2023.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is on the residential side. You talked about some pretty good improvement in January. I was just wondering if you can talk about what's really driving it. Is it driven by better execution? Can you talk about how you're better using technology and other tools to improve the residential growth in 2023? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff : We -- you got to keep in mind that as we wound down 2022 November, December, we reduced marketing -- some of our marketing spend or advertising spend in the back half of the year and so that softened the end of the fourth quarter of last year. And we began turning our advertising and marketing efforts back on in January. Across the board, I think, we had pretty good weather. We had a pretty good business environment. We had a lot less of the impact of COVID than we did the prior year in January. It was just an overall better environment not necessarily something about technology or anything along those lines. It was just an overall better environment that helped with demand. I don't know John you have anything to add to that? \nJohn Wilson: Only maybe staffing. We were better staffed and a better staff position. Part of that's related to COVID. \nJerry Gahlhoff : Post-COVID, yes.\nJohn Wilson: We were really racked with people out sick with COVID in January a year ago. And so this year we were better positioned to handle the opportunity that we had. \nAshish Sabadra: That's great. And then maybe just a broader question on organic growth. If we look at over the last three years organic growth has improved materially compared to the pre-pandemic level. And so as we look into 2023, but also with the mid-term not looking from a guidance perspective but just as we think about the organic growth trajectory, should we think about it more being in line with the recent history particularly the organic growth being more in line with the recent history? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff : As you know, Ashish, we don't provide guidance. However, we do -- when we do look at our business I think we all know that this is a very attractive market with attractive growth opportunities. And if you look at the business over the long-term and eliminating some of the fluctuations and volatility that you saw during COVID and recovery from COVID, this market has the opportunity to continue to grow at that mid to high single digits. So we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow our business over the long term at that mid to high single-digit sort of growth rate all the while continuing to be very active on the acquisition front.\nKenneth Krause: We have no intention to take the foot off the gas and slow it down. So our goal is always to try to get better and maintain or beat those rates year-over-year. So that's our aim. We're going to keep going.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great. And congrats on a solid quarter. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nHans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans on for Stephanie. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just wanted to dig in a bit more on the resi business in Q4. Obviously, realize a bit slower growth there and in your prepared remarks you kind of referenced it's kind of been consistent across the industry. I just wondered if you could talk about some of those trends in the industry more broadly? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: The main data point that we look at is we can get information from for example, search engines like Google, where they can report \u2013 they report to us the volume of category searches. So for example, the number of people searching for the category or words like pest control. And those were down \u2013 I think Julie, I think \u2013 I remember the number was in the 15% range is what we heard across the industry. The category search was down around the 15% mark. So that seems \u2013 it appears to be across the board. And those are data that we get from companies like Google.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just maybe I want to dig in a bit more on sort of cost inflation. Could you talk a bit about what you're seeing \u2013 where you're seeing cost inflation a bit more sticky in your business and then maybe where it's moderating a bit? And then just kind of your ability to price in excess of cost inflation given some of the pull forward in pricing for 2023? \nKenneth Krause: Yes certainly. When we look at the business, there's two or three broad buckets of costs. There's people, there's materials and then there's fleet. And when we look at the business, we started to see gradual improvement in fleet as we move throughout the year. The pressures that we felt earlier in the year when oil was much higher than where it is currently, started to abate as we went throughout the year. The one point that was good to see for us as we finished the year was actually improvements in materials and supplies. And so the second category of costs that I spoke about materials and supplies was certainly \u2013 it was helpful to see some improvement as a percentage of sales to close the year out in that area. And last but certainly not least, our people costs, we continue to manage that very closely. It's a challenging market. Our focus is on hiring the best and the brightest, retaining and providing the tools that will continue to drive that high level of engagement across our workforce that in turn results in that high level of customer service that we're known for. And so we're continuing to manage the inflationary pressures. And that's part of the reason why Jerry spoke about our intent and desire to pull forward the pricing. We're trying to stay ahead of the inflationary cycle that we're all feeling and trying to pass along that price and price our \u2013 the value of the services that we're providing to our customers.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And Ken, while the fleet is \u2013 we're seeing some improvement largely driven by fuel. Where we haven't seen any relief is in repairs and maintenance. The cost of replacing just a single tire remains sky high. Basic service on a vehicle is \u2013 continues to climb. And we've just got no relief there. That's one element within fleet. But as Ken said, on the M&S side, we've got those margins back in line. Our teams have fought to help us do that in the procurement side. Those have seemed to have come back to normalized levels. So that's good news for us.\nHans Hoffman: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn. Please proceed with your question.\nOliver Davies: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just firstly, just what are you seeing in terms of the international markets that you operate in? And is growth kind of higher or lower out in those markets than it is in the US? \nKenneth Krause: Those markets continue to be very attractive for us. We continue to grow our business. And in fact last year we made significant acquisitions in the UK market. We build out our platform of businesses and services that we're providing in the UK because we view that as a very attractive market. We'll continue to deploy capital internationally, but I have to remind you also that the US is our largest market it's our fastest growing market and it's highly fragmented. So it provides us tremendous amount of growth opportunities as we go forward. So we're pretty bullish, we're pretty optimistic and we feel like we've got a great growth plan that spans the globe.\nOliver Davies: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess on the termite side, I'm assuming a decent amount of that grows from ancillary sales. So what are you seeing on just the termite business?\nKenneth Krause: We don't break out the termite business from the ancillary, so it's hard to report that. But what I would say is we continue to see demand for the termite business. A lot of people look at the non-residential -- or the residential housing market and get concerned about a slowdown in new housing starts and such. And while we are managing through the challenges associated with higher interest rates, we're seeing good growth come through that business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And we have great performance driving the sales of our termite baiting programs to customers as well. We very good take rates on that. It's got very high customer retention and we try to make sure we bundle that with all our service offerings.\nOliver Davies: Thanks so much.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Butler: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah, we can.\nBrian Butler: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the organic growth. Can you provide maybe some color on how much maybe was cross-selling versus price and how that opportunity for cross-selling looks going into 2023?\nKenneth Krause: It's hard to parse it down into that level of detail. But what I can tell you is when we look at the overall growth rate of roughly 10 or so percent, you back off just over 3% of that for acquisitions so you arrive at about 7% or so of total growth. As Jerry indicated, last year we pulled the price increase forward a bit. So we actually saw a little bit more of pricing not only from pulling it forward, but because we were passing along a higher pricing -- price inflation to our customers. And so if you -- if -- we had talked previously about passing along roughly a 4% price increase, we probably realized something in the 2% to 3%. So you could see that our underlying real growth rate is in that 4% to 5% is what we estimate. And it's just an estimation, but that's what we're estimating that our underlying growth rate is without price.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And in terms of the opportunity to continue to drive cross-sell through the business at this point the upside looks endless. We have plenty of customers, but we still haven't touched to add our mosquito programs too as well as any of our -- any host of our ancillary service offerings. So when we look at the percentage of our customers with multiple services with two or more services, three or more services that percentage is still low enough that we have a long runway to continue to sell through.\nJohn Wilson: And Jerry if I may add as it relates to cross-selling, a critical aspect of that is being well-staffed in both your sales management arena and your sales team. And currently we are well-staffed. That's why we believe that cross-selling will continue to increase. Without the staff you can't -- you're having to offer those services proactively. And so without a staff out there to do it, it just doesn't happen.\nJerry Gahlhoff: That's a good point, John. And we do continue to ramp up our sales staffing, even in our 2023 plans are to continue to ramp up our sales team volume to be able to handle, and be out there talking to our existing customers about adding services to their programs.\nBrian Butler: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then when you think about that pricing kind of pulling it forward again in 2023, how much \u2013 I mean, I think you stated it was fully offsetting inflation? So does that continue to drive those incremental margins of 30% through 2023, or is it even better than that?\nKenneth Krause: We're hopeful that \u2013 I mean, we've got a number of levers that we're pulling to continue to maintain our margin profile. Pricing is only one of them. And so we are optimistic about our ability to continue to drive margins. We're not committing to necessarily a specific margin target, but we do see an opportunity to continue to improve our margin profile over the long term.\nBrian Butler: Okay. And if I could slip maybe one last one. On the M&A kind of rollover into 2023, any color on what's already embedded in there from deals that you closed in 2022?\nKenneth Krause: The only thing, I would say, there is 2022, as you know is a little bit of a light year for us with respect to acquisitions. If you go back to 2020 and 2021, we spent almost $150 million each of those years on acquisitions. This past year, we spent \u2013 just about $120 million. So you could see that the rollover may not be at or above 3% like, it has been the last couple of years, it might be slightly lower than that. But what I \u2013 what we've reiterated in our prepared comments is we are incredibly active with respect to acquisitions. And so we continue to go after and court opportunities across the country across the world. And so we continue to be very active on this front. Stay tuned on this front, because it's an area that Jerry and I are spending a lot of our time.\nBrian Butler: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for final comments.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we appreciate your interest in our company. We will be filing our 10-K with the SEC later today after the close of the market, and we look forward to updating you in April on our first quarter earnings call. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jerry and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter and finish to the year. Let me start with a few highlights. First, revenue growth was healthy with total revenue growing approximately 10% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. Acquisitions drove 3% of revenue growth in the quarter and for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunities that will enable us to continue to drive growth through acquisition in the quarters and years to come. Second, quarterly adjusted EBITDA margins were a healthy 22.1%, up approximately 180 basis points versus the same period a year ago. We saw strong results throughout the income statement. GAAP earnings per share were $0.17, up from $0.14 in the same period a year ago. It was good to see the strong growth in earnings on the healthy revenue growth.

If you recall, we adjusted the prior year quarterly EBITDA margin by the impact of the non-recurring SEC matter. As we discussed on the last call, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. In the quarter, on an as-reported basis, we generated incremental adjusted EBITDA margins that we're approaching 40%. When you take out the lower advertising spend I mentioned previously, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30% for the quarter. And even with incurring the higher casualty charges in the second half, incremental adjusted EBITDA margins for the second half were approaching 30%. This is certainly good to see. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $84 million or $0.17 in adjusted earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong to finish the year. We generated $116 million of free cash flow on $84 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 20% in the quarter and was up a very healthy 16% for the entire year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash was well above 100% for the quarter and the full year. We made acquisitions totaling $9 million and we paid $64 million in dividends during the quarter. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We were in a net cash position to finish the year. Year-to-date we have made acquisitions totaling just over $119 million and paid dividends of approximately $212 million. Debt balances are down $100 million since the beginning of the year and cash is down $10 million finishing at $95 million at the end of 2022. We are actively evaluating options to refinance our credit facilities that are set to expire in April of 2024. We expect to make progress on this in the first quarter. Also during the quarter, we corrected immaterial misstatements in the financial statements. Our press release and our 10-K that we expect to file later today will include more information on these changes. But in summary these are non-cash-related items that reduced what we originally reported for earnings by an immaterial amount. By making this change historical earnings increased by $0.01 per share per year. Let me repeat we understated historical reported earnings by $0.01 per share per year. The immaterial changes are related to purchase accounting for acquisitions. The short of it is that the company allocated too much of the acquired asset value to amortizable intangible assets in the past and this adjustment corrects for this. In closing, our fourth quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust and we are very well positioned to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is very healthy and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us very well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry for closing remarks. Jerry? Good morning. Thanks for the question, Tim. This is Ken. I'll take this question. But I would agree with you. We had really good performance in the fourth quarter with respect to our cost control programs and SG&A. As I'd indicated in my prepared commentary, we had an advertising benefit of about $7 million. So that's about 120 basis points of the improvement. However, we certainly continue to look at a number of opportunities to continue to improve our cost structure going forward. We certainly did leverage it with the higher growth rates that we were able to deliver in the quarter, but we also are very actively evaluating and continue to contemplate cost changes and cost reduction measures across our business. We have no intention to take the foot off the gas and slow it down. So our goal is always to try to get better and maintain or beat those rates year-over-year. So that's our aim. We're going to keep going. Yes certainly. When we look at the business, there's two or three broad buckets of costs. There's people, there's materials and then there's fleet. And when we look at the business, we started to see gradual improvement in fleet as we move throughout the year. The pressures that we felt earlier in the year when oil was much higher than where it is currently, started to abate as we went throughout the year. The one point that was good to see for us as we finished the year was actually improvements in materials and supplies. And so the second category of costs that I spoke about materials and supplies was certainly \u2013 it was helpful to see some improvement as a percentage of sales to close the year out in that area. And last but certainly not least, our people costs, we continue to manage that very closely. It's a challenging market. Our focus is on hiring the best and the brightest, retaining and providing the tools that will continue to drive that high level of engagement across our workforce that in turn results in that high level of customer service that we're known for. And so we're continuing to manage the inflationary pressures. And that's part of the reason why Jerry spoke about our intent and desire to pull forward the pricing. We're trying to stay ahead of the inflationary cycle that we're all feeling and trying to pass along that price and price our \u2013 the value of the services that we're providing to our customers. Those markets continue to be very attractive for us. We continue to grow our business. And in fact last year we made significant acquisitions in the UK market. We build out our platform of businesses and services that we're providing in the UK because we view that as a very attractive market. We'll continue to deploy capital internationally, but I have to remind you also that the US is our largest market it's our fastest growing market and it's highly fragmented. So it provides us tremendous amount of growth opportunities as we go forward. So we're pretty bullish, we're pretty optimistic and we feel like we've got a great growth plan that spans the globe. We don't break out the termite business from the ancillary, so it's hard to report that. But what I would say is we continue to see demand for the termite business. A lot of people look at the non-residential -- or the residential housing market and get concerned about a slowdown in new housing starts and such. And while we are managing through the challenges associated with higher interest rates, we're seeing good growth come through that business. Thank you. It's hard to parse it down into that level of detail. But what I can tell you is when we look at the overall growth rate of roughly 10 or so percent, you back off just over 3% of that for acquisitions so you arrive at about 7% or so of total growth. As Jerry indicated, last year we pulled the price increase forward a bit. So we actually saw a little bit more of pricing not only from pulling it forward, but because we were passing along a higher pricing -- price inflation to our customers. And so if you -- if -- we had talked previously about passing along roughly a 4% price increase, we probably realized something in the 2% to 3%. So you could see that our underlying real growth rate is in that 4% to 5% is what we estimate. And it's just an estimation, but that's what we're estimating that our underlying growth rate is without price. We're hopeful that \u2013 I mean, we've got a number of levers that we're pulling to continue to maintain our margin profile. Pricing is only one of them. And so we are optimistic about our ability to continue to drive margins. We're not committing to necessarily a specific margin target, but we do see an opportunity to continue to improve our margin profile over the long term. The only thing, I would say, there is 2022, as you know is a little bit of a light year for us with respect to acquisitions. If you go back to 2020 and 2021, we spent almost $150 million each of those years on acquisitions. This past year, we spent \u2013 just about $120 million. So you could see that the rollover may not be at or above 3% like, it has been the last couple of years, it might be slightly lower than that. But what I \u2013 what we've reiterated in our prepared comments is we are incredibly active with respect to acquisitions. And so we continue to go after and court opportunities across the country across the world. And so we continue to be very active on this front. Stay tuned on this front, because it's an area that Jerry and I are spending a lot of our time. Thank you."

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that, we're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'm also equally proud of the hard-working men and women of our company that continue to drive our growth through great customer service. I'd like to provide my comments on our 2022 fourth quarter performance. Ken will then address the financials in more detail in a moment. Reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies, Rollins delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, highlighted by total revenue growth of over 10% in the fourth quarter, and over 11% for the full year. Operationally, we have strong momentum in our markets. The company remains well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives, and we're seeing solid levels of growth in the business. As many of you are aware, Rollins has a long-standing company-wide focus on personal safety. Complementing our existing guidelines and protocols we continue to implement new initiatives designed to empower our employees and enable an accountable, safety-driven culture. First training remains crucial for keeping our customers out of harm's way. Second, we're updating incentive metrics and our compensation programs to emphasize safety down to the branch level. A branch manager's bonus plan will now have stronger ties to safety metrics for their operation. We're also working on a new employee-level program to incentivize the highest levels of safe-driving behaviors. We began to pilot this program later this year \u2013 or we plan to pilot this program later this year for our 10000-plus drivers at Rollins. We believe these initiatives will help ensure our workforce returns home to their family, safely each and every day. Looking closer at the financial results and the growth we delivered. Organic growth came in at 6.9% compared with 7.8% for the full year. While still strong, we realized slower growth in the residential sector. While market data indicates this to be consistent across the industry, we started 2023 with strong residential revenue performance in January. While a month is not a long-term trend it was good to see solid demand to start the year. We also continue to succeed in our other service lines particularly within our termite and ancillary, which grew 15.4% year-over-year. Rollins remains very well-positioned to drive ancillary growth within this business. We've taken on the responsibility to educate homeowners on termite prevention and treatment along with other ancillary offerings. And from the customer perspective these service offerings are from a trusted partner. We remain focused on driving revenue growth from cross-selling activities across our large and growing customer base. Our team continues to do a tremendous job here. Our commercial line has also presented a strong year for us with 10.3% growth over the prior year. The sales teams continue to perform very well on both locally sold and national account sales efforts across all our commercial brands. We're seeing strong results in this area with solid performance with customers in the retail, restaurant and office building segments. Across all the service lines I just discussed, a key driver of growth is pricing. During 2022 in light of the ongoing inflationary challenges, we brought forward our annual price increase program to earlier in the year. In 2023, we are bringing this forward even earlier. Most of these price increases will be initiated beginning in early March and some were already implemented in January. Furthermore, our non-Orkin brands are ramping up their focus on pricing the value of our services. Additionally, all our brands are increasing their rate cards. We expect the inflationary environment to persist into 2023 and are focused on managing the price/cost equation. Acquisitions remain a major focus as we start 2023. During 2022 we successfully completed 31 acquisitions representing a total of $119 million invested. This compares with 39 acquisitions and $146 million invested in 2021. While we successfully completed four acquisitions during the fourth quarter we proactively remain on the sidelines during the last few months of 2022 and turned our attention to 2023 deals in our pipeline. We're very optimistic about what's in store for the New Year as leveraging strategic acquisitions remains a focus of our growth strategy. Next, we remain committed to investing in our business to drive efficiency. As part of this we continue to leverage technology by adding a number of new applications to our portfolio of brands. For example, building off our successes with routing and scheduling technology at Orkin and Western Pest Services, we're rolling out routing and scheduling technology initiatives at Clark and HomeTeam. Each of these brands are making meaningful progress at improving efficiency. Clark expects to be at full utilization by the end of this quarter and is very excited about the results to-date. Robert Baker Clark's President went so far as to comment that this initiative is proving to be the best thing for Clark in many years. HomeTeam should complete their implementation and be at full utilization by the end of the second quarter. Both brands have seen an improvement in their on-time delivery metrics since implementation started. In addition to enabling us to reach our customers in a more efficient and productive manner, we found these initiatives can meaningfully reduce both our overall mileage between service visits and drive time for the technician. Not only does this lower our fuel requirements it also has a direct impact on our labor costs. With that, I look forward to answering your questions in a few moments. However, before I turn the call over to Ken I want to emphasize that our team at Rollins had a successful year in 2022 and we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in our business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Good morning. Yes, Tim, this is Jerry. Since Ken's been here it's one of the hot topics on his radar screen is our SG&A and how can we get better and how can we improve and Ken has challenged us and brought that equation to the table. And as you know we're always looking to get better. And so we're -- and Ken's finding some ways to help us do that. Yes. So, Tim this is Jerry. So on the -- really on the Orkin side, we are looking to very similar levels to what we did in prior year, where we've actually gotten more aggressive in our other brands than we were at prior year. So if anything on the whole the net result of that is what we expect is better performance out of pricing going forward in 2023. We -- you got to keep in mind that as we wound down 2022 November, December, we reduced marketing -- some of our marketing spend or advertising spend in the back half of the year and so that softened the end of the fourth quarter of last year. And we began turning our advertising and marketing efforts back on in January. Across the board, I think, we had pretty good weather. We had a pretty good business environment. We had a lot less of the impact of COVID than we did the prior year in January. It was just an overall better environment not necessarily something about technology or anything along those lines. It was just an overall better environment that helped with demand. I don't know John you have anything to add to that? Post-COVID, yes. As you know, Ashish, we don't provide guidance. However, we do -- when we do look at our business I think we all know that this is a very attractive market with attractive growth opportunities. And if you look at the business over the long-term and eliminating some of the fluctuations and volatility that you saw during COVID and recovery from COVID, this market has the opportunity to continue to grow at that mid to high single digits. So we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow our business over the long term at that mid to high single-digit sort of growth rate all the while continuing to be very active on the acquisition front. Thank you. The main data point that we look at is we can get information from for example, search engines like Google, where they can report \u2013 they report to us the volume of category searches. So for example, the number of people searching for the category or words like pest control. And those were down \u2013 I think Julie, I think \u2013 I remember the number was in the 15% range is what we heard across the industry. The category search was down around the 15% mark. So that seems \u2013 it appears to be across the board. And those are data that we get from companies like Google. And Ken, while the fleet is \u2013 we're seeing some improvement largely driven by fuel. Where we haven't seen any relief is in repairs and maintenance. The cost of replacing just a single tire remains sky high. Basic service on a vehicle is \u2013 continues to climb. And we've just got no relief there. That's one element within fleet. But as Ken said, on the M&S side, we've got those margins back in line. Our teams have fought to help us do that in the procurement side. Those have seemed to have come back to normalized levels. So that's good news for us. And we have great performance driving the sales of our termite baiting programs to customers as well. We very good take rates on that. It's got very high customer retention and we try to make sure we bundle that with all our service offerings. Yeah, we can. And in terms of the opportunity to continue to drive cross-sell through the business at this point the upside looks endless. We have plenty of customers, but we still haven't touched to add our mosquito programs too as well as any of our -- any host of our ancillary service offerings. So when we look at the percentage of our customers with multiple services with two or more services, three or more services that percentage is still low enough that we have a long runway to continue to sell through. That's a good point, John. And we do continue to ramp up our sales staffing, even in our 2023 plans are to continue to ramp up our sales team volume to be able to handle, and be out there talking to our existing customers about adding services to their programs."

Julie will read our forward-looking statement disclaimer and then we'll begin. Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that, Rollins closed out last year with continued strong revenue growth and solid financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we report revenue improved 10.2% to $661 million, and net income improvement of 26.1% to $84 million. For all of 2022, we achieved revenue growth of more than 11%, with net income improving as well. Jerry and Ken will provide greater detail, but all credit goes to our tremendous team, who continue to overcome many obstacles. As we begin 2023, the company remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry. Good morning. Only maybe staffing. We were better staffed and a better staff position. Part of that's related to COVID. We were really racked with people out sick with COVID in January a year ago. And so this year we were better positioned to handle the opportunity that we had. And Jerry if I may add as it relates to cross-selling, a critical aspect of that is being well-staffed in both your sales management arena and your sales team. And currently we are well-staffed. That's why we believe that cross-selling will continue to increase. Without the staff you can't -- you're having to offer those services proactively. And so without a staff out there to do it, it just doesn't happen."

I'm pleased to report that Rollins' third quarter performance was highlighted by continued growth and solid financials. As we look ahead, the company remains well positioned to continue accomplishment of our long-term business objectives. I'm also proud to welcome Rollins' new Chief Financial Officer, Kenneth Krause. Ken is a highly regarded business executive with more than two decades of financial and accounting experience. Ken is already contributing to our success. We welcome him to our team. Jerry will share more about Ken later. Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our Vice Chairman, who will provide some business updates. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Rollins delivered another strong performance this quarter, reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies. I want to continue to emphasize that Rollins' success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work for our company. This incredible team works hard every day to achieve our objectives and take great care of our customers. At Rollins, our people are our most valuable asset. Pursuant to that, we are always looking to improve our employee training and benefit offerings as well as providing a workplace where they are respected and able to grow professionally. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Everside Health to offer on-site health center providing primary care at our Atlanta home office and virtually nationally. This new program offers free or reduced cost primary care for all employees. We're pleased to share that since its opening four months ago, this effort has registered over 500 employee visits and filled over 300 prescriptions. We are very focused on enabling our employees to live healthier lives at home and at work, while enjoying multiple benefits within this effort. With same day and next day appointments, this help center handles everything from routine screenings to chronic disease management. It also offers on-site lab draws, medication prescriptions, immunizations, mental health services, as well as the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. Further, we plan to expand this free primary care offering to the covered dependence of our team members starting January 1st. Feedback to date has been extremely positive with a very high satisfaction rate. Ultimately, we believe that by providing easier access to these kinds of services, we are facilitating better health outcomes and happier, healthier employees. We also recently expanded our employee stock purchase plan. This plan allows employees the option to purchase shares of Rollins' common stock at a 10% discounted price through payroll deductions. Since we launched the plan in July 2022, we are pleased that over 2,200 employees have enrolled. This represents greater than 130% growth in employee stock ownership participants compared to our previous program. Most importantly, we want to encourage employee ownership in Rollins as we want everything - everyone to think and act like owners in our company. In summary, guided by our commitment to employees and our culture, we feel these types of benefit programs an improvement - are important to our long term success, not only by retaining and incentivizing our valued employees at all levels and for them to have a vested interest in our performance but also, to effectively position Rollins brands as a leading contender for top talent. Last, I would like to discuss Hurricane Ian. Thank goodness, all of our employees in the Ian's path are safe, but they have needed an assistance. Through our Rollins Employee Relief Fund, our team provided over 170 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first 10 days following the hurricane to enable team members to address essential needs. Since then, the relief team has been processing multiple full grants to address employees who have endured even greater hardship. Our hearts go out to those affected by the hurricane, but I must acknowledge how excited we were about all our team members who have jumped in to assist those impacted in various ways. They quickly volunteered their time and energy often after work hours to gather, load and deliver supplies to those most in need. This was a total team effort and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to help one another. Overall, while Ian shut down a total of 28 branch offices, 18 were only closed for a day or two, while the remainder opened by the end of the following week. Between these few location closures and the loss of several vehicles within our fleet, the impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. In early August, we announced that Ken Krause will be joining Rollins as our new Chief Financial Officer effective September 1st. Ken has many years of finance experience, most recently as the CFO of a large publicly-traded global manufacturer. You'll hear from him in a little bit, but for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of speaking with him yet, he is passionate about business, very experienced and has a unique combination of strategic, operational and financial expertise. We are extremely pleased to have him as a member of our leadership team. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 third quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment. Looking at our financial results, Rollins' third quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 12.2% to $730 million compared to $650 million in last year's third quarter. Net income was $108 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This is compared to $94 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. Operationally during the quarter, all of Rollins business lines continue to experience solid growth. Residential pest control increased 9.8%, commercial pest control was up 11.4%, and termite increased 18.9%. Overall, organic presented a strong 8.6% total growth for the quarter. Next, I'd like to turn to the expense side. During the last few conference calls, we have discussed various inflationary pressures, primarily fleet-related costs, specifically fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. We've also provided insights into the proactive actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. In this context, I'm pleased to note that during Q3, we're beginning to see a gradual improvement in fuel prices. We've also been reducing our overall mileage per service visit through routing and scheduling initiatives. Overall, when compared to last quarter, Q3 presented a 5% reduction in fuel expense. On the fleet side, as we discussed previously, we're keeping our trucks longer forcing higher than normal cost for items like basic maintenance and tires, as well as some repairs outside of the norm. Recently, a small amount of new fleet vehicles are beginning to arrive from our primary manufacturers, which certainly will help. However, the quantities are less than what we historically received by this point of the year. Looking ahead, we're told by our manufacturers that the supply environment is improving and that potentially we could expect an uptick in inflow levels for new vehicles in the coming quarters. As we've received similar assurances last year, we're certainly keeping a watchful eye on this and we'll keep you updated on future conference calls. On the labor side, even though the tight labor market, Rollins remain well positioned in effectively attracting, retaining and deploying talent by prioritizing employee well-being, workplace inclusion and professional development opportunities, while also providing attractive employee benefit offerings. We have a track record of being a premier destination for talent. As we headed into peak hiring season this year, we successfully integrated a recruiting software platform to allow our hiring managers to more efficiently recruit and engage with potential new candidates. This talent recruitment platform makes it easier for prospective team members to explore open positions on our career portals and apply for open positions in just a few minutes and they can do so easily from a mobile device. Our hiring managers can more easily pre-screen candidates, communicate with them and schedule interviews in a more streamlined way. As a result of this new improved process, we averaged 35,000 job applicant submittals per month for the third quarter. And over the last five months, we have almost matched the total year 2021 application submittals. In short, by offering candidates an enhanced hiring experience, we've been able to successfully source and add qualified talent across the country despite the tight labor market. Next, I'd like to turn to acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have completed 27 acquisitions. Five of these were completed in the third quarter across Canada, Australia and the U.S. In August, we announced the acquisition of Bug House Pest Control. Bug House Pest Control was Founded by Mike Prosperi in 1993, and has grown to be one of the largest pest control companies in Georgia. Bug House serves residential and commercial customers throughout Central and South Georgia. We are proud to welcome their more than 220 team members to Rollins. We continue to pursue potential opportunities as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, our pipeline remains strong. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins' strong third quarter performance. We are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Krause: Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and I look forward to working with Jerry and the team across Rollins as we continue to drive value for all of our stakeholders. During my first 60 or so days, I've had the opportunity to spend time with several of our key stakeholders. I've spoken with investors and attended investor conferences. I've spent time at industry trade shows and visited with our teams in the field. It has been beneficial to interact with our investors, employees, vendors and customers. As I reflect on my experiences thus far, I want to highlight two key observations. First, Rollins has a strong commitment to doing what is right and best for all of our stakeholders. Our commitment to our customers and employees is second to none. The company places a tremendous amount of effort on promoting a culture that is focused on solving our customers' problems the first time and providing our employees with a workplace where they can build a long and rewarding career. Second, our strategy is driving strong results. We have a very valuable business model, well recognized brands and a strong financial position by which we can drive profitable growth. Let me start by highlighting a few key accomplishments in the quarter. First, revenue growth was strong with organic revenue growing just under 9% on an as reported basis. Second, EBITDA margins were healthy at 23.3%, up 10 basis points versus the same period a year ago, despite incurring higher casualty reserve charges. These charges weighed down EBITDA margins by approximately 140 basis points in the quarter. I will spend more time on the casualty reserve in a bit, but it was good to see the strong margin performance in this challenging inflationary period. Earnings per share improved 15% to $0.22 per share and free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 60% versus the same period a year ago. Let's now dive into the quarterly results in more detail. Quarterly revenue was $730 million, up just over 12% on a reported basis. This includes approximately 4% of growth from acquisitions. Currencies reduced sales growth by 50 basis points on the stronger dollar notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. It was good to see strong organic growth across our service lines. All services commercial, residential and termite services grew at a double-digit growth rate with very strong organic growth in commercial and termite businesses. Residential revenues increased approximately 10% with growth stemming from both acquisitions and organic activity. We also had strong growth across substantially all of our brands. We are not seeing any significant signs of slowing and retention rates are not changing materially. Overall, demand for our services remains robust to start the fourth quarter. Turning to profitability. Gross profit was 52.3% of sales in the quarter, down 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The decline is driven primarily by an increase in our casualty reserve related to auto claims. As I said earlier, this increase drove EBITDA margins down by 140 basis points in the quarter with the most significant impact on gross profit. This expense in the quarter was driven by a number of auto-related claims that matured in the quarter. These claims tend to change from time-to-time and we either reached resolution or received additional information about the nature of the claim that provided for a better estimation of the total liability associated with the claim in the quarter. Excluding this, we saw improvement in gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures and increases associated with people, fleet and other areas. Pricing and managing our margins remains at the top of our agenda. SG&A expense in the quarter was just under $214 million or 29.3% of sales, up approximately $20 million from the prior year. As a percent of revenue, we realized 60 basis points of leverage in SG&A on the double-digit sales growth, which helped to offset the gross profit headwinds. GAAP operating income was $145 million or 19.7% of revenue, up 20 basis points from the year ago period. EBITDA margin was 23.3%, up 10 basis points over the prior year. As I indicated, the increased expense associated with claims activity negatively impacted EBITDA margins by 140 basis points. I like to look at the business using incremental margins or what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. And in the quarter, on an as reported basis, we generated 24% incremental margins, but over 35% when you consider the quarter included the higher expense associated with the claims activity. GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.22 in earnings per share, increasing 15% versus the same period a year ago on the 12% increase in reported revenue. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated over $120 million of free cash flow on a $108 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 60% in the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling approximately $60 million in the third quarter and we paid just under $50 million of dividends. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1 times on a gross level. Cash balances approximated debt balances to end the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions totaling just over $110 million and paid dividends of approximately $148 million. Debt balances are down $30 million since the beginning of the year and cash is up over $16 million, finishing at $122 million to finish the third quarter. Speaking of dividends, we increased our regular quarterly dividend last night to $0.13 per share, an increase of 30% versus the third quarter a year ago. With this announcement, this will enable us to realize an increasing dividend again in 2022. We are well positioned to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. Our focus is to consistently fund a regular dividend that increases as our business grows, while continuing to use our balance sheet to fund additional acquisition-related growth. Our third quarter performance demonstrated the strength of our business model. Organic demand remains robust and we are well positioned to continue to use our balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is very healthy and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving a long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Gary for closing remarks. Gary?\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes. Good morning, everybody.\nGary Rollins: Good morning.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning.\nKenneth Krause: Good morning.\nTim Mulrooney: So, first I wanted to ask on the residential business. Well, first I should say congratulations on a great quarter, but I wanted to dig into the residential business for just a second, because there is some concern right now about the state of the consumer, and I was hoping that you could comment on the trends that you're seeing with respect to volumes in your resi business specifically. Are you starting to see any slowdown as we move from August to September to October, given the increased macro uncertainty, and could you maybe comment on how lead generation these days compares to maybe to last year?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Tim, this is Jerry. The residential businesses is - it remain strong. Certainly, leads are down a little bit. It's hard to always - you don't know if it's economic, if - is it weather driven, those kinds of things. It's hard to attribute it. Despite that, we still have our challenges keeping up with the lead volume that we get in the quarter. And when you also look at the quarter on the residential side, we were impacted at the end of the quarter if you see it kind of dragging a little lower than the other two categories. We were impacted the worst possible time for that hurricane was end the month at the end of the quarter, and that was a revenue drag in Southwest Florida and parts of Florida, where we're very heavily weighted on the residential side. And so that - to end the quarter, that was a bit challenging but - and that's certainly had more of a drag on residential revenue than necessarily some change in demand. John or anybody you have anything to add there?\nJohn Wilson: Well, the only thing I would add Tim is that leads for residential have been down for some time. Quality of lead and lead closure has been up, leading to increased sales and increasing organic revenue but lead closure or leads receives excuse me as a measure of the strength of the residential business is not really unnecessarily a good yardstick. We continue to close at a higher rate and our - and where we can give some labor challenges, our teams are getting to the work. So we're still seeing strength in it. Is it as strong as it was over the last couple of years? Maybe not, but we're very optimistic still about residential.\nKenneth Krause: The only thing I would add as well is from a revenue perspective as Jerry had pointed out. We had good revenue growth throughout the quarter. It was interesting, when we look at the revenue growth by month throughout the quarter in the residential area, we saw a little bit of weakness in July associated with just some COVID exposures and some challenges with COVID, but August was exceptionally strong and September was very healthy as well, but unfortunately, our ability to deliver services was hampered by the hurricane, which hit us late in the quarter. So overall, business remains pretty well intact on the residential side.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And let's not forget that hurricane also impacted South Carolina as well, went through there, which is another area where we have a large - a very large presence on the residential standpoint.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color everybody. So it sounds like - yes and Jerry you're right like that's exactly what I was looking at. I was looking at the trend slowing down in residential, but it seems like that might be much more related to the hurricane than anything else and it's still a very strong result. So it sounds like demand remained strong there. My last question is maybe for Ken or Julie. It's just a quick one. The 8.6% organic growth figure, does that just exclude acquisitions? In other words, if I exclude the 50 basis points of foreign currency headwind, would organic growth have been more like 9.1% for the quarter?\nKenneth Krause: You're thinking about that correct, Tim. We had a 50 basis point headwind on revenues. The 8.6% is an as reported organic number. So adding back the currency headwind, your organic growth would have been just north of 9%.\nTim Mulrooney: Thank you everybody.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question, and again, let me add my congrats as well to the solid quarter. I just wanted to focus more on the cross-selling opportunities. I was wondering if you could talk about how much traction are you getting on cross selling into your existing customer base? And also as the technicians are more appropriately staffed, how is that helping drive better sales momentum among your existing but also new customers? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: So a lot of what you see in the termite ancillary growth is a result of cross-selling to your existing customer base, so that's where we get a lot of the lift - is on the termite ancillary side is directly through cross-sell opportunity. So that continues to remain strong and continues to be a great opportunity for us for certainly for years to come. We have seen a nice uptick this year also in technicians sales that has in some ways offset our - a little bit of the lead decline, and the better we know the better staffed we are with technicians, the more technicians will actively sell. So getting that formula right is good and we have certainly seen an uptick in technician involved sales, where it could be upgrades on the commercial side but as well as on the residential side as well. We see - we do see sales productivity ticking up with technicians.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great. And maybe if I can just have a follow up question on the margins. The incremental margins of 35% excluding the one-time item looks like a very strong margin growth profile. As we think about going forward, not necessarily from a guidance perspective but as we think about some of the puts and takes and inflation rolling over and revenue momentum being strong, is that the right way to think about the incremental margins going forward? Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: Ashish, I don't want to commit to something too early here. I am only 60 days or so in, but what I'll tell you is the gross margin profile of 50 plus percent is certainly an appealing gross margin profile and provides me a sense of confidence in our ability to generate that type of margin profile, but what I'd ask for is a little bit of time to better understand the business and some of the drivers that we have in the business. But nonetheless, that gross margin profile that we do have and the pricing opportunities we have in our business gives me some confidence in our ability to continue to improve our margins going forward.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great. Congrats once again on such a good quarter.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nSeth Weber: Hey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Ken. I guess, I just wanted to ask a question on pricing. Can you just kind of catch us up on where you're at with pricing? I think you pushed through increases in April and May and I think on the last call, you talked about that was going to be it for like for the year, but can just maybe talk to us about your thoughts on pricing going forward, whether you - if the inflationary environment continues, whether you might take another shot at raising pricing and just whether it sounds like maybe there has been a little bit of push back, maybe some - maybe attrition ticked up a little bit is what it's sounded like from your messaging, but if there is - if you're seeing any kind of customer churn based on the pricing actions you've taken? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: So we feel like our price increase program was very successful this year and certainly, as Ken noted, it attributed some of our success here in the third quarter to pricing, not only to our - through rate increases, but also increasing our rate cards and our new sales pricing is up rather significantly, that's been helpful. Our strategy will be to get through the rest of this fiscal year. In January, we'll all meet again, and we'll have a discussion about our price increase strategy for 2023 and assess what the economic environment looks like, what's going on and make some determinations at that point. We need to have those discussions in - fairly early in the year if we're going to keep it on the same cycle to be able to deploy that price increase by March and April timeframes, should we - depend on what levels we go at. So - and part of that process in January will also be a very lengthy look back - detailed look back into our price increase campaign this year, what the impact on rollbacks and customer retention was, and we'll use those data to help us determine what we will - what our plan will look like in 2023. We've monitored that. We haven't noticed any real significant jump in retention due to pricing, so we feel pretty good about where we are right now.\nSeth Weber: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just maybe can you just touch on what you're seeing in the international markets? I know, it's not a big part of your business, but if there's any notable changes in trends internationally versus U.S.? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I guess, internationally, we see some of the - feeling a little bit of some of the impact in the U.K. of their inflationary pressures there, but our business in the United Kingdom is doing quite well, that team there is thriving. Same in Australia. They're performing very well. So we're very happy with the results that we're getting internationally. Singapore is a little down. They've had some a little more challenges on the revenue growth side and that's been largely - they were engaged during the peak of COVID with a lot of disinfection services and some of those disinfection services have disappeared. And so they've struggled a little bit more, not necessarily because of any economic conditions more just a shift in what's going on in the market from a pest control and disinfection standpoint. But overall, internationally, you think of Canada as well, our Canadian operations are doing fantastic and they're growing well. So it's all very positive on that front.\nSeth Weber: Great. Okay. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nHans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering, could you maybe dive in a bit on kind of what drove the strength in the commercial and termite business?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I didn't quite catch what you asked for. So, could you repeat your question for me?\nHans Hoffman: Yes. Could you just talk a little bit sort of what drove the strength in the commercial and termite business?\nJerry Gahlhoff: A lot of that is having feet on the street and staff and having the staffing and the quality team on both the commercial and the number of home inspectors we have in the field. It's really about being staffed to handle demand and drive those - drive the sales results that we get. You look at our headcount of commercial account managers and our head - the volume of home inspectors that we've added over the last 12 to 18 months. That's by far the largest driver of the growth that we're seeing. Those folks have been very successful given - with the tools and infrastructure that we give them to be successful in their sales jobs. And by far, I think that's been the biggest driver. John, do you have any other opinion on that?\nJohn Wilson: Yes. I think you hit the nail on the head, Jerry. It's all about having the right amount of people to handle the production of the sales needed to grow those service lines. That only grows by having feet on the street, not by - it's not lead driven, I guess. I'm trying to say like the residential side. So you got to have those bodies in front of those customers.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you in February for our fourth quarter earnings. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here and I look forward to working with Jerry and the team across Rollins as we continue to drive value for all of our stakeholders. During my first 60 or so days, I've had the opportunity to spend time with several of our key stakeholders. I've spoken with investors and attended investor conferences. I've spent time at industry trade shows and visited with our teams in the field. It has been beneficial to interact with our investors, employees, vendors and customers. As I reflect on my experiences thus far, I want to highlight two key observations. First, Rollins has a strong commitment to doing what is right and best for all of our stakeholders. Our commitment to our customers and employees is second to none. The company places a tremendous amount of effort on promoting a culture that is focused on solving our customers' problems the first time and providing our employees with a workplace where they can build a long and rewarding career. Second, our strategy is driving strong results. We have a very valuable business model, well recognized brands and a strong financial position by which we can drive profitable growth. Let me start by highlighting a few key accomplishments in the quarter. First, revenue growth was strong with organic revenue growing just under 9% on an as reported basis. Second, EBITDA margins were healthy at 23.3%, up 10 basis points versus the same period a year ago, despite incurring higher casualty reserve charges. These charges weighed down EBITDA margins by approximately 140 basis points in the quarter. I will spend more time on the casualty reserve in a bit, but it was good to see the strong margin performance in this challenging inflationary period. Earnings per share improved 15% to $0.22 per share and free cash flow was very healthy with operating cash flow growing over 60% versus the same period a year ago. Let's now dive into the quarterly results in more detail. Quarterly revenue was $730 million, up just over 12% on a reported basis. This includes approximately 4% of growth from acquisitions. Currencies reduced sales growth by 50 basis points on the stronger dollar notably versus the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. It was good to see strong organic growth across our service lines. All services commercial, residential and termite services grew at a double-digit growth rate with very strong organic growth in commercial and termite businesses. Residential revenues increased approximately 10% with growth stemming from both acquisitions and organic activity. We also had strong growth across substantially all of our brands. We are not seeing any significant signs of slowing and retention rates are not changing materially. Overall, demand for our services remains robust to start the fourth quarter. Turning to profitability. Gross profit was 52.3% of sales in the quarter, down 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. The decline is driven primarily by an increase in our casualty reserve related to auto claims. As I said earlier, this increase drove EBITDA margins down by 140 basis points in the quarter with the most significant impact on gross profit. This expense in the quarter was driven by a number of auto-related claims that matured in the quarter.

GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.22 in earnings per share, increasing 15% versus the same period a year ago on the 12% increase in reported revenue. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated over $120 million of free cash flow on a $108 million of earnings in the quarter. Free cash flow increased by over 60% in the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling approximately $60 million in the third quarter and we paid just under $50 million of dividends. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1 times on a gross level. Cash balances approximated debt balances to end the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions totaling just over $110 million and paid dividends of approximately $148 million. Debt balances are down $30 million since the beginning of the year and cash is up over $16 million, finishing at $122 million to finish the third quarter. Speaking of dividends, we increased our regular quarterly dividend last night to $0.13 per share, an increase of 30% versus the third quarter a year ago. With this announcement, this will enable us to realize an increasing dividend again in 2022. We are well positioned to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. Our focus is to consistently fund a regular dividend that increases as our business grows, while continuing to use our balance sheet to fund additional acquisition-related growth.

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. In early August, we announced that Ken Krause will be joining Rollins as our new Chief Financial Officer effective September 1st. Ken has many years of finance experience, most recently as the CFO of a large publicly-traded global manufacturer. You'll hear from him in a little bit, but for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of speaking with him yet, he is passionate about business, very experienced and has a unique combination of strategic, operational and financial expertise. We are extremely pleased to have him as a member of our leadership team. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 third quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment. Looking at our financial results, Rollins' third quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 12.2% to $730 million compared to $650 million in last year's third quarter. Net income was $108 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This is compared to $94 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. Operationally during the quarter, all of Rollins business lines continue to experience solid growth. Residential pest control increased 9.8%, commercial pest control was up 11.4%, and termite increased 18.9%. Overall, organic presented a strong 8.6% total growth for the quarter. Next, I'd like to turn to the expense side. During the last few conference calls, we have discussed various inflationary pressures, primarily fleet-related costs, specifically fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. We've also provided insights into the proactive actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. In this context, I'm pleased to note that during Q3, we're beginning to see a gradual improvement in fuel prices. We've also been reducing our overall mileage per service visit through routing and scheduling initiatives. Overall, when compared to last quarter, Q3 presented a 5% reduction in fuel expense. On the fleet side, as we discussed previously, we're keeping our trucks longer forcing higher than normal cost for items like basic maintenance and tires, as well as some repairs outside of the norm. Recently, a small amount of new fleet vehicles are beginning to arrive from our primary manufacturers, which certainly will help. However, the quantities are less than what we historically received by this point of the year. Looking ahead, we're told by our manufacturers that the supply environment is improving and that potentially we could expect an uptick in inflow levels for new vehicles in the coming quarters. As we've received similar assurances last year, we're certainly keeping a watchful eye on this and we'll keep you updated on future conference calls. On the labor side, even though the tight labor market, Rollins remain well positioned in effectively attracting, retaining and deploying talent by prioritizing employee well-being, workplace inclusion and professional development opportunities, while also providing attractive employee benefit offerings. We have a track record of being a premier destination for talent. As we headed into peak hiring season this year, we successfully integrated a recruiting software platform to allow our hiring managers to more efficiently recruit and engage with potential new candidates. This talent recruitment platform makes it easier for prospective team members to explore open positions on our career portals and apply for open positions in just a few minutes and they can do so easily from a mobile device. Our hiring managers can more easily pre-screen candidates, communicate with them and schedule interviews in a more streamlined way. As a result of this new improved process, we averaged 35,000 job applicant submittals per month for the third quarter. And over the last five months, we have almost matched the total year 2021 application submittals. In short, by offering candidates an enhanced hiring experience, we've been able to successfully source and add qualified talent across the country despite the tight labor market. Next, I'd like to turn to acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have completed 27 acquisitions. Five of these were completed in the third quarter across Canada, Australia and the U.S. In August, we announced the acquisition of Bug House Pest Control. Bug House Pest Control was Founded by Mike Prosperi in 1993, and has grown to be one of the largest pest control companies in Georgia. Bug House serves residential and commercial customers throughout Central and South Georgia. We are proud to welcome their more than 220 team members to Rollins. We continue to pursue potential opportunities as we look ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, our pipeline remains strong. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins' strong third quarter performance. We are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and improving profitability in the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Good morning. Tim, this is Jerry. The residential businesses is - it remain strong. Certainly, leads are down a little bit. It's hard to always - you don't know if it's economic, if - is it weather driven, those kinds of things. It's hard to attribute it. Despite that, we still have our challenges keeping up with the lead volume that we get in the quarter. And when you also look at the quarter on the residential side, we were impacted at the end of the quarter if you see it kind of dragging a little lower than the other two categories. We were impacted the worst possible time for that hurricane was end the month at the end of the quarter, and that was a revenue drag in Southwest Florida and parts of Florida, where we're very heavily weighted on the residential side. And so that - to end the quarter, that was a bit challenging but - and that's certainly had more of a drag on residential revenue than necessarily some change in demand. John or anybody you have anything to add there? And let's not forget that hurricane also impacted South Carolina as well, went through there, which is another area where we have a large - a very large presence on the residential standpoint. Thank you. So a lot of what you see in the termite ancillary growth is a result of cross-selling to your existing customer base, so that's where we get a lot of the lift - is on the termite ancillary side is directly through cross-sell opportunity. So that continues to remain strong and continues to be a great opportunity for us for certainly for years to come. We have seen a nice uptick this year also in technicians sales that has in some ways offset our - a little bit of the lead decline, and the better we know the better staffed we are with technicians, the more technicians will actively sell. So getting that formula right is good and we have certainly seen an uptick in technician involved sales, where it could be upgrades on the commercial side but as well as on the residential side as well. We see - we do see sales productivity ticking up with technicians. Thank you. So we feel like our price increase program was very successful this year and certainly, as Ken noted, it attributed some of our success here in the third quarter to pricing, not only to our - through rate increases, but also increasing our rate cards and our new sales pricing is up rather significantly, that's been helpful. Our strategy will be to get through the rest of this fiscal year. In January, we'll all meet again, and we'll have a discussion about our price increase strategy for 2023 and assess what the economic environment looks like, what's going on and make some determinations at that point. We need to have those discussions in - fairly early in the year if we're going to keep it on the same cycle to be able to deploy that price increase by March and April timeframes, should we - depend on what levels we go at. So - and part of that process in January will also be a very lengthy look back - detailed look back into our price increase campaign this year, what the impact on rollbacks and customer retention was, and we'll use those data to help us determine what we will - what our plan will look like in 2023. We've monitored that. We haven't noticed any real significant jump in retention due to pricing, so we feel pretty good about where we are right now. I guess, internationally, we see some of the - feeling a little bit of some of the impact in the U.K. of their inflationary pressures there, but our business in the United Kingdom is doing quite well, that team there is thriving. Same in Australia. They're performing very well. So we're very happy with the results that we're getting internationally. Singapore is a little down. They've had some a little more challenges on the revenue growth side and that's been largely - they were engaged during the peak of COVID with a lot of disinfection services and some of those disinfection services have disappeared. And so they've struggled a little bit more, not necessarily because of any economic conditions more just a shift in what's going on in the market from a pest control and disinfection standpoint. But overall, internationally, you think of Canada as well, our Canadian operations are doing fantastic and they're growing well. So it's all very positive on that front. I didn't quite catch what you asked for. So, could you repeat your question for me? A lot of that is having feet on the street and staff and having the staffing and the quality team on both the commercial and the number of home inspectors we have in the field. It's really about being staffed to handle demand and drive those - drive the sales results that we get. You look at our headcount of commercial account managers and our head - the volume of home inspectors that we've added over the last 12 to 18 months. That's by far the largest driver of the growth that we're seeing. Those folks have been very successful given - with the tools and infrastructure that we give them to be successful in their sales jobs. And by far, I think that's been the biggest driver. John, do you have any other opinion on that?"

            "content": "Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Rollins delivered another strong performance this quarter, reflecting solid execution of our operating strategies. I want to continue to emphasize that Rollins' success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work for our company. This incredible team works hard every day to achieve our objectives and take great care of our customers. At Rollins, our people are our most valuable asset. Pursuant to that, we are always looking to improve our employee training and benefit offerings as well as providing a workplace where they are respected and able to grow professionally. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership with Everside Health to offer on-site health center providing primary care at our Atlanta home office and virtually nationally. This new program offers free or reduced cost primary care for all employees. We're pleased to share that since its opening four months ago, this effort has registered over 500 employee visits and filled over 300 prescriptions. We are very focused on enabling our employees to live healthier lives at home and at work, while enjoying multiple benefits within this effort. With same day and next day appointments, this help center handles everything from routine screenings to chronic disease management. It also offers on-site lab draws, medication prescriptions, immunizations, mental health services, as well as the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. Further, we plan to expand this free primary care offering to the covered dependence of our team members starting January 1st. Feedback to date has been extremely positive with a very high satisfaction rate. Ultimately, we believe that by providing easier access to these kinds of services, we are facilitating better health outcomes and happier, healthier employees. We also recently expanded our employee stock purchase plan. This plan allows employees the option to purchase shares of Rollins' common stock at a 10% discounted price through payroll deductions. Since we launched the plan in July 2022, we are pleased that over 2,200 employees have enrolled. This represents greater than 130% growth in employee stock ownership participants compared to our previous program. Most importantly, we want to encourage employee ownership in Rollins as we want everything - everyone to think and act like owners in our company. In summary, guided by our commitment to employees and our culture, we feel these types of benefit programs an improvement - are important to our long term success, not only by retaining and incentivizing our valued employees at all levels and for them to have a vested interest in our performance but also, to effectively position Rollins brands as a leading contender for top talent. Last, I would like to discuss Hurricane Ian. Thank goodness, all of our employees in the Ian's path are safe, but they have needed an assistance. Through our Rollins Employee Relief Fund, our team provided over 170 emergency grants to impacted employees within the first 10 days following the hurricane to enable team members to address essential needs. Since then, the relief team has been processing multiple full grants to address employees who have endured even greater hardship. Our hearts go out to those affected by the hurricane, but I must acknowledge how excited we were about all our team members who have jumped in to assist those impacted in various ways. They quickly volunteered their time and energy often after work hours to gather, load and deliver supplies to those most in need. This was a total team effort and we are tremendously proud of their care, compassion and commitment to help one another. Overall, while Ian shut down a total of 28 branch offices, 18 were only closed for a day or two, while the remainder opened by the end of the following week. Between these few location closures and the loss of several vehicles within our fleet, the impact to our employees in the days following the storm was far worse than the impact to our business. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our quarter. Well, the only thing I would add Tim is that leads for residential have been down for some time. Quality of lead and lead closure has been up, leading to increased sales and increasing organic revenue but lead closure or leads receives excuse me as a measure of the strength of the residential business is not really unnecessarily a good yardstick. We continue to close at a higher rate and our - and where we can give some labor challenges, our teams are getting to the work. So we're still seeing strength in it. Is it as strong as it was over the last couple of years? Maybe not, but we're very optimistic still about residential. Yes. I think you hit the nail on the head, Jerry. It's all about having the right amount of people to handle the production of the sales needed to grow those service lines. That only grows by having feet on the street, not by - it's not lead driven, I guess. I'm trying to say like the residential side. So you got to have those bodies in front of those customers."

Management will make some operating remarks, and we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin?\nGary Rollins: Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2022 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement disclaimer, and then we'll begin.\nJulie Bimmerman: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a very strong financial performance in the second quarter and remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. On today's call, I'm excited to share our strategic management succession plan that has been unanimously approved by our Board of Directors. We firmly believe that this is the right time to initiate this important leadership transition. Effective January 1, 2023, Jerry Gahlhoff, the Rollins Chief Operating Officer and President, will be elevated to the position of Chief Executive Officer or CEO. I'll remain Chairman of the Board, and Jerry will continue in his current role as President of Rollins. The following five months will be transitional while Jerry becomes more familiar with the areas involving his future responsibilities. The Company is well positioned financially and operationally. We have a proven management team, leading brands and a very strong culture. I'm extremely confident in the future of Rollins and look forward to working closely with Jerry to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. While I'll be moving away from the day-to-day operations, as I continue serving as our company Chairman of the Board, I will remain active and focused on our business goals and strategic plans. As many of you know, Jerry has been with Rollins since the 2008 acquisition of HomeTeam. And he's been instrumental in our success. What most don't know is that Jerry grew up in an Orkin household as his father worked for the Company for 26 years. His dad was a great employee. Jerry is an exceptional leader with great vision and a deep understanding of our industry and our customers. His years of service to Rollins has been marked by outstanding performance and accomplishments. He was promoted to Rollins President and Chief Operating Officer in 2020 and has had a unique opportunity to be intimately involved in most every facet of our organization. In 2021, Jerry joined the Rollins Board of Directors. His business acumen, leadership experience, strong sense of duty and his devotion to our company make him a natural fit to assume our President and Chief Executive Officer role. I have the utmost confidence that Jerry will continue to foster our strong company heritage record of accomplishments and promote the culture of Rollins. Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our Vice Chairman, who will provide some business updates. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of all of us here at Rollins, I would like to congratulate Jerry on his long successful tenure as Rollins CEO. Gary's 56-year career with our company has been marked by superior achievements and an unrelenting focus on our customers, our shareholders and our employees. He's a tremendous leader. And in addition to his impressive business results over the multiple decades, he has been steadfast in leading Rollins' high-performance culture. But the best part about this change is that he isn't going anywhere and will continue to be a valuable resource to all of us. Turning to our performance. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results with revenue increasing to $714 million and net income totaling $100 million or $0.20 per share. Overall, we experienced solid growth across our numerous pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Finally, you've heard me say this many times, we regard our employees as our most important asset. They are an integral part of our success. As we continue to grow, we recognize the talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for that talent. Consistent with that approach, we're continually looking to improve our employee benefits and I'm pleased to announce that Rollins has partnered with Everside Health to offer an on-site health center located at our Atlanta home office. This new health center offers convenient primary care services for everything from screenings and prevention to chronic disease management and urgent care for several thousand of our employees in the area. There are multiple benefits and features to this program, including same-day and next-day appointments, on-site lab draws, medications and immunizations, mental health services and the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. In addition to our Atlanta facility, our U.S. employees have access to over 70 Everside Health clinics, and we are live in 37 states for virtual primary care. The safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority, and we believe offering this new benefit will lead to better health outcomes, allowing employees to live healthier lives. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business. Congratulations, Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. Before I get into our second quarter operating review, I would like to say a few words about Gary. As Gary mentioned, I came to Rollins through the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. As many of you know, those can be tensed in uncertain times for those being acquired. Gary talked with me personally. His words and subsequent actions reassured me that I had found a home at Rollins and my experience here has been meaningful and worthwhile. Over the past 14 years, I've learned so much from Gary, and there's one thing I'm sure of, he has an unwavering commitment to our company, our customers and our employees. The proof of this is in his actions and results. It's truly an honor to succeed Gary as CEO and lead this incredible company of more than 17,000 exceptional employees, each of whom brings a commitment to deliver the best for our customers every day. With Gary and John's continued guidance, I look forward to continuing to build on our great success as we begin this new chapter of the Company's future. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 second quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our financial results. Rollins second quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 11.9% to $714 million compared to $638 million in last year's second quarter. Net income was $100.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share. This is compared to $98.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, during the quarter, all our business lines continued to experience solid growth. In fact, we grew double digits in all service lines. Residential pest control increased 11%, commercial pest control was up 11.2% and termite increased 15%. Keep in mind that this level of growth came on top of our company's highest historical recorded growth in Q2 last year of 15.3%. On the expense side, we continue to feel inflationary pressures during the second quarter from fleet-related costs like fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these as well as provide an update on the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. While we're efficiently navigating through this period and believe that our proactive initiatives have helped, we're keeping a watchful eye on inflationary pressures, fuel costs and supply chain costs and how they may affect Rollins. Management of fuel expense is a notable example. As we grow, we improved customer density. And when coupled with our routing and scheduling technology initiatives, we continue to reduce our overall mileage between service visits, which lowers our fuel requirements. We saved over 5.8 million miles driven in the quarter or $1.3 million. This savings was slightly offset by increased average price per gallon over Q2 2021 of over $400,000, equating to net fuel savings of $875,000. This has also helped manage labor costs as our technicians have less unproductive windshield time, plus we've created a better job for them along the way. As we move through the second half of 2022, we expect we'll see the ongoing benefits of these improvements. Furthermore, looking ahead, we're committed to enhancing the overall efficiency of our fleet while also reducing carbon emissions. In June, we announced that BMW Group ranked Rollins 15th out of the top 50 green fleets in the United States. This primarily reflects Rollins use of hybrid sedans that are being driven by our sales and management personnel. However, we recently began testing the use of light-duty hybrid trucks. Given their excellent fuel economy, we are focused on having a sizable uptick in our hybrid truck fleet by 2024. Additionally, given recent technology advancements, we've been testing the use of battery-powered application equipment going from gas power to battery provides us with a compelling opportunity to reduce emissions without sacrificing the effectiveness of our service. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives in the quarters ahead. As you may recall from prior conference calls, we've been proactively addressing increased supply chain costs in our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. This includes termite and ancillary service offerings as well. We have solid long-term working relationships with our manufacturers and have deep visibility into the supply process, often a few levels up in the supply chain. In doing so, we're often able to achieve greater operational efficiencies and overall flexibility by not only having materials shipped quickly but also having real-time insights advising us when we need to order materials. We continue to seek opportunities to diversify through alternative suppliers and actively seek shipping and freight efficiencies. On the subject of pricing, we successfully implemented our annual price increase programs earlier this year. As mentioned on our last conference call, aggressive service price increases were initiated within all our brands during April and May as compared to historical timing of the early summer months and prior years. We are already realizing a notable benefit from this initiative more than doubling our traditional 1% to 2% net growth levels from our past price increase programs. Overall, we saw little resistance from our customers on the higher price increases put into place, which is a confirmation of service satisfaction. Next, on our acquisition pipeline, it remains strong, and we have plenty of potential opportunities that we are actively pursuing. So far in 2022, we have completed 22 strategic acquisitions within the U.S., United Kingdom and Australia. In the U.K., we achieved an important milestone during the quarter with the acquisition of Europest. In addition to expanding our geographic footprint within the U.K., it is also our first location in Wales. Strategically, we now have full coverage within the United Kingdom, as this tuck-in transaction comes on the heels of another recent U.K. acquisition, NBC Environment, which provided our first locations within Scotland. Moving forward, Strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow and expand our business. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins second quarter results and that we remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie?\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, Jerry. First, I would like to congratulate both Gary and Jerry on reaching the next pinnacles in their careers. Gary, your extraordinary impact on Rollins has been legendary. Jerry, you definitely have large shoes to fill as CEO. Jerry, also watching your career grow from our early days at HomeTeam to President of Rollins has been exciting, and I have no doubt that you will excel in this new role. I appreciate your trust and leadership through the years and cannot wait to see what the future holds. So now on to the numbers. We delivered a strong second quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial metrics. As a reminder, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discussed during today's earnings presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on News and Events and presentation. Our second quarter revenues of $714 million represented an increase of 11.9% actual exchange rate, 8.7% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth totaled 10.7% with 7.5% organic. As Jerry mentioned, residential, commercial and termite all presented strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Residential grew 11%, 7% organic. Commercial grew 11.2%, 9.3% organic. Lastly, we have termite, which grew 15% with 11.2% organic. Now on to our income. For the second quarter and year-to-date, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for 2021 for comparison purposes due to the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties of $450,000 in Q2 of last year, and $31.5 million year-to-date in 2021. Second quarter EBITDA of 2022 was $159.2 million or 1.2% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $157.3 million. Second quarter 2022 EPS was $0.20 per diluted share equal to 2021 adjusted EPS. Second quarter 2022 gross margin decreased to 52.8% or 0.5 point below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q2 2022 primarily from fuel presenting an increase of $6.8 million and vehicle repairs of $1.7 million over last year. Fuel increases were driven by over a 50% increase in our average price paid per gallon in Q2 2022 over 2021. Vehicle repairs were up due to the continued delay in receipt of new vehicles from the manufacturers. We keep our trucks longer, forcing repairs outside of our norm. Combined, these fleet expenses -- these fleet expense increases equated to 0.9 point in additional cost, taking these fleet-related increases out of the equation, gross margin increased over last year. Sales, general, administrative, or SG&A as a percentage of revenue for Q2 2022 increased over 2021 by 2.1% to 30.8%. Travel was a contributor as this increased 65.7% over Q2 2021. This was due to a return to normalized levels for leadership travel to branch locations along with overall increased cost in air travel and rental cars. We also saw an increase in advertising from a combination of an increase in our advertising campaign to counteract the late arrival of spring along with the impact of a change in our process for estimating and accruing our advertising expenses. Aligning these costs with our high Q2 sales equated to an increase in advertising of 2% of revenues over Q2 2021. For the full year, we expect overall normalized historical spend levels for advertising. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends Q2 2022, totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 22% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions increased 218.7% to $36.4 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $221 million in cash, of which, $62.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our free cash flow for Q2 was $119.4 million or an increase of 26.6% over last year. This increase was primarily driven by timing of income tax payments. Last, I'm pleased to share that yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on September 9, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business August 10, 2022. This represents a 25% increase over the dividend paid in September 2021. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the second quarter of 2022, it situates our financial strength and the Board's confidence in our continued growth. Gary, I'll turn it back over to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: First, I just want to say to Gary, congratulations. Very few CEOs can boast the same level of tenure and success that you can and I look forward to staying in touch regardless.\nGary Rollins: Thank you.\nTim Mulrooney: First one, EBITDA margins were down a little bit more this quarter than I was expecting. And what was helpful last quarter as you guys bucketed these things for us. The primary buckets being fuel or I don't know if you want to call it, fleet, another major cost bucket is labor and another one is materials, if you were going to rank those headwinds in terms of the things that impacted your EBITDA margins the most and if there's any way to quantify it. I think that would be really helpful for investors, it certainly was very helpful for us last quarter.\nJulie Bimmerman: Sure. Tim, this is Julie. So I'll jump in. So I would say the -- our largest impact was getting back to the advertising expenses we said, which was gain -- or excuse me, an increase of 2% of our revenues. And I do want to go ahead and go over this. This is where we updated our quarterly processes for estimating and accruing our advertising expenses to better reflect our shift to digital advertising. I do want to make a point on this, though, and this is the key point is this, we will maintain the normalized historical percentage of revenue spend for the advertising when you look at the year as a whole. So we are dealing with timing there. The next largest item would have been our fuel and the fuel itself was a $6.8 million increase over last year. So that was significant over Q2 of last year.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would add that from a labor standpoint, we did a pretty good job of keeping service wages, in particular, relatively flat year-over-year. That really wasn't a significant driver of everything. It's heavily on what Julie mentioned.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. So I mean that's very consistent with what you said last quarter. I guess, labor had more disruption in January. But you were saying that, that wouldn't be as much of an issue going forward. It sounds like it's not, it's mostly fleet and advertising expense. So that's really helpful.\nJerry Gahlhoff: January, it was driven by the COVID situation, which is just seems to be ramping back up again, but we're managing through it a little better right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Congrats to both of you, Gary and Jerry. My first question would be on the revenue growth, pretty strong momentum there across all businesses. I was wondering if you could help parse out -- you obviously talked about a more aggressive price increase, but also if you can talk about the improved retention as well as on the sales momentum side, can you talk about how the improved ad campaign helped you more on the inbound, but also the technicians being appropriately staffed? How is that helping you drive sales momentum. So if you could just parse out some of the growth drivers and quantify some of those tailwinds?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Well, I think on the -- Julie, on the revenue growth side, we certainly got some additional lift from the price increase part that helped us quite a bit. We were lapping a pretty big second quarter last year, in particular, our -- the month of April and in 2021 was really difficult to lap from a growth standpoint, but we managed through it pretty well, and things picked up quite a bit in May and June to help recover from there. Retention remains -- customer retention remains strong, and our team is doing a pretty good job on service delivery. We're staffed better than we were a year ago from a technician standpoint, being able to get to new customers, service our existing customers. So that's all good. We've gotten a lot of positive response to, in particular, Orkin's transition to -- with their new ad campaigns. Especially with the Orkin Pro, we've received a lot of very strong feedback. Our -- the people that work at Orkin, our team members at Orkin really like it. It's getting a lot of attention. I know it's good when I hear about it from my children because they're seeing it on TikTok. And so they see those ads on TikTok and seem to have a lot of fun with them.\nJulie Bimmerman: Yes. And then to add on to that, just as a reminder, I think Jerry commented on his section of the script is our price increase that brought in over double what we typically see from our annual price increase. So that was a part of that growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hamza Mazari with Jefferies.\nHans Hoffman: This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. Could you just give us a sense of how much capacity you have in your sales force and what your hiring plans are going forward?\nJerry Gahlhoff: We're pretty well staffed on the sales side, both in the commercial and residential side. we can always -- there's always room for improvements to drive -- when you have a salesperson at full capacity or selling high levels monthly, the next step to do is hire another and build them back up and continue to drive that incremental growth and get improvements. So we always -- there's always a little bit of capacity there to do better. But as we get closer to capacity, we look to add staffing where it makes sense. And we're always -- that's just kind of a numbers game and math game that we play.\nJulie Bimmerman: Yes. And that's where we really worked hard at the end of last year is when we started doing the heavy staff up on our commercial side of our sales force just so that we could be prepared for this year and be able to honestly be able to close the deals that we're closing today.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And certainly, the commercial results that we're getting are a result of those -- the increased staffing and the increased productivity for sales rep that we're seeing.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities.\nSeth Weber: Congratulations, guys. I just had a question on, I think fuel prices started picking up last June, June 2021. So is it -- so now that we have kind of an apples-to-apples compare going forward, should we expect gross margin to be up year-over-year for the rest of the year or is that the right way to think about it?\nJulie Bimmerman: I'll start, and then I'm sure Jerry will want to jump in as well. Everything -- we're all reading the same thing when it comes to fuel is we -- a lot of things -- areas say that the fuel prices are going to be going down, but then we see things that are happening on the other side of the globe that gives the impression that it could go up. So, so much depends on that. So if you're assuming that fuel does not keep on having that variability, we'll definitely -- that's one thing to keep in mind. But I also want to address materials and supplies. Jerry commented on this as well. And I'm going to jump in and use the phrase that Jerry has commented on in the Board meeting yesterday. He said that sometimes we feel like we're playing whack-a-mole with the materials and supplies because we have different vendors and different that are looking at -- they have to make increases to cover either their shipping or cover their supply costs themselves. And we keep on having to jump in. We're having to look every single day and see in our purchasing group is saying, where do we need to go. Where should we be purchasing. And really monitoring these relationships. It's a long way of saying it depends what's going to happen with our vendors. It depends what's going to happen with our suppliers. And honestly, the fuel prices. All of that being said, if that calms down, then yes, margins would improve. Do you want to add to that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would agree that those are the two main variables. It's going to be what happens with fuel and fleet and can we get our -- the trucks on time that we are expecting to be delivered to us. Can we get -- they can get delivered and we can start heading off some of these repair expenses that we're having. And then plus we have the ongoing benefit of offsetting some of these costs over the coming months with routing and scheduling, more of the technology adoption and advancement that we can get out there and increase usage of the tools they have, especially during busy season, that will help us with those offsets. Not too concerned about the labor side. I think we'll manage the labor. But certainly, fuel and vehicle repairs and materials supplies. Those are the wildcards that were basically managed through a very -- it seems like every week, we're getting notified about some other price increase that we're having to make adjustments to from suppliers. So that's why Julie said it's like playing whack-a-mole. So as long as we remain vigilant on that, and we'll see what happens from a fuel standpoint. That's the wildcard.\nOperator: Our final question is from Brian Butler with Stifel.\nBrian Butler: Just to follow up, I guess, on pricing and inflation. If inflation continues to move higher or even accelerate, is there a potential another rate increase the back half of 2022 or maybe a surcharge that would be used to offset that? Or would Rollins wait until maybe next year to catch up and then address the higher costs?\nGary Rollins: We've done quite a bit of research as far as our price increases are concerned. And certainly, we would be opposed to having another price increase this year. We really studied the frequency and the amount very carefully. And it's been our experience that you really need to have some time in between and don't get greedy.\nOperator: Thank you. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. And thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. Before I get into our second quarter operating review, I would like to say a few words about Gary. As Gary mentioned, I came to Rollins through the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. As many of you know, those can be tensed in uncertain times for those being acquired. Gary talked with me personally. His words and subsequent actions reassured me that I had found a home at Rollins and my experience here has been meaningful and worthwhile. Over the past 14 years, I've learned so much from Gary, and there's one thing I'm sure of, he has an unwavering commitment to our company, our customers and our employees. The proof of this is in his actions and results. It's truly an honor to succeed Gary as CEO and lead this incredible company of more than 17,000 exceptional employees, each of whom brings a commitment to deliver the best for our customers every day. With Gary and John's continued guidance, I look forward to continuing to build on our great success as we begin this new chapter of the Company's future. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 second quarter performance, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the period. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our financial results. Rollins second quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 11.9% to $714 million compared to $638 million in last year's second quarter. Net income was $100.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share. This is compared to $98.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, during the quarter, all our business lines continued to experience solid growth. In fact, we grew double digits in all service lines. Residential pest control increased 11%, commercial pest control was up 11.2% and termite increased 15%. Keep in mind that this level of growth came on top of our company's highest historical recorded growth in Q2 last year of 15.3%. On the expense side, we continue to feel inflationary pressures during the second quarter from fleet-related costs like fuel and vehicle repairs and materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these as well as provide an update on the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these pressures. While we're efficiently navigating through this period and believe that our proactive initiatives have helped, we're keeping a watchful eye on inflationary pressures, fuel costs and supply chain costs and how they may affect Rollins. Management of fuel expense is a notable example. As we grow, we improved customer density. And when coupled with our routing and scheduling technology initiatives, we continue to reduce our overall mileage between service visits, which lowers our fuel requirements. We saved over 5.8 million miles driven in the quarter or $1.3 million. This savings was slightly offset by increased average price per gallon over Q2 2021 of over $400,000, equating to net fuel savings of $875,000. This has also helped manage labor costs as our technicians have less unproductive windshield time, plus we've created a better job for them along the way. As we move through the second half of 2022, we expect we'll see the ongoing benefits of these improvements. Furthermore, looking ahead, we're committed to enhancing the overall efficiency of our fleet while also reducing carbon emissions. In June, we announced that BMW Group ranked Rollins 15th out of the top 50 green fleets in the United States. This primarily reflects Rollins use of hybrid sedans that are being driven by our sales and management personnel. However, we recently began testing the use of light-duty hybrid trucks. Given their excellent fuel economy, we are focused on having a sizable uptick in our hybrid truck fleet by 2024. Additionally, given recent technology advancements, we've been testing the use of battery-powered application equipment going from gas power to battery provides us with a compelling opportunity to reduce emissions without sacrificing the effectiveness of our service. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives in the quarters ahead. As you may recall from prior conference calls, we've been proactively addressing increased supply chain costs in our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. This includes termite and ancillary service offerings as well. We have solid long-term working relationships with our manufacturers and have deep visibility into the supply process, often a few levels up in the supply chain. In doing so, we're often able to achieve greater operational efficiencies and overall flexibility by not only having materials shipped quickly but also having real-time insights advising us when we need to order materials. We continue to seek opportunities to diversify through alternative suppliers and actively seek shipping and freight efficiencies. On the subject of pricing, we successfully implemented our annual price increase programs earlier this year. As mentioned on our last conference call, aggressive service price increases were initiated within all our brands during April and May as compared to historical timing of the early summer months and prior years. We are already realizing a notable benefit from this initiative more than doubling our traditional 1% to 2% net growth levels from our past price increase programs. Overall, we saw little resistance from our customers on the higher price increases put into place, which is a confirmation of service satisfaction. Next, on our acquisition pipeline, it remains strong, and we have plenty of potential opportunities that we are actively pursuing. So far in 2022, we have completed 22 strategic acquisitions within the U.S., United Kingdom and Australia. In the U.K., we achieved an important milestone during the quarter with the acquisition of Europest. In addition to expanding our geographic footprint within the U.K., it is also our first location in Wales. Strategically, we now have full coverage within the United Kingdom, as this tuck-in transaction comes on the heels of another recent U.K. acquisition, NBC Environment, which provided our first locations within Scotland. Moving forward, Strategic acquisitions will continue to be an important component in our initiatives to further grow and expand our business. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins second quarter results and that we remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Julie? I would add that from a labor standpoint, we did a pretty good job of keeping service wages, in particular, relatively flat year-over-year. That really wasn't a significant driver of everything. It's heavily on what Julie mentioned. January, it was driven by the COVID situation, which is just seems to be ramping back up again, but we're managing through it a little better right now. Well, I think on the -- Julie, on the revenue growth side, we certainly got some additional lift from the price increase part that helped us quite a bit. We were lapping a pretty big second quarter last year, in particular, our -- the month of April and in 2021 was really difficult to lap from a growth standpoint, but we managed through it pretty well, and things picked up quite a bit in May and June to help recover from there. Retention remains -- customer retention remains strong, and our team is doing a pretty good job on service delivery. We're staffed better than we were a year ago from a technician standpoint, being able to get to new customers, service our existing customers. So that's all good. We've gotten a lot of positive response to, in particular, Orkin's transition to -- with their new ad campaigns. Especially with the Orkin Pro, we've received a lot of very strong feedback. Our -- the people that work at Orkin, our team members at Orkin really like it. It's getting a lot of attention. I know it's good when I hear about it from my children because they're seeing it on TikTok. And so they see those ads on TikTok and seem to have a lot of fun with them. We're pretty well staffed on the sales side, both in the commercial and residential side. we can always -- there's always room for improvements to drive -- when you have a salesperson at full capacity or selling high levels monthly, the next step to do is hire another and build them back up and continue to drive that incremental growth and get improvements. So we always -- there's always a little bit of capacity there to do better. But as we get closer to capacity, we look to add staffing where it makes sense. And we're always -- that's just kind of a numbers game and math game that we play. And certainly, the commercial results that we're getting are a result of those -- the increased staffing and the increased productivity for sales rep that we're seeing. I would agree that those are the two main variables. It's going to be what happens with fuel and fleet and can we get our -- the trucks on time that we are expecting to be delivered to us. Can we get -- they can get delivered and we can start heading off some of these repair expenses that we're having. And then plus we have the ongoing benefit of offsetting some of these costs over the coming months with routing and scheduling, more of the technology adoption and advancement that we can get out there and increase usage of the tools they have, especially during busy season, that will help us with those offsets. Not too concerned about the labor side. I think we'll manage the labor. But certainly, fuel and vehicle repairs and materials supplies. Those are the wildcards that were basically managed through a very -- it seems like every week, we're getting notified about some other price increase that we're having to make adjustments to from suppliers. So that's why Julie said it's like playing whack-a-mole. So as long as we remain vigilant on that, and we'll see what happens from a fuel standpoint. That's the wildcard."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of all of us here at Rollins, I would like to congratulate Jerry on his long successful tenure as Rollins CEO. Gary's 56-year career with our company has been marked by superior achievements and an unrelenting focus on our customers, our shareholders and our employees. He's a tremendous leader. And in addition to his impressive business results over the multiple decades, he has been steadfast in leading Rollins' high-performance culture. But the best part about this change is that he isn't going anywhere and will continue to be a valuable resource to all of us. Turning to our performance. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results with revenue increasing to $714 million and net income totaling $100 million or $0.20 per share. Overall, we experienced solid growth across our numerous pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Finally, you've heard me say this many times, we regard our employees as our most important asset. They are an integral part of our success. As we continue to grow, we recognize the talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for that talent. Consistent with that approach, we're continually looking to improve our employee benefits and I'm pleased to announce that Rollins has partnered with Everside Health to offer an on-site health center located at our Atlanta home office. This new health center offers convenient primary care services for everything from screenings and prevention to chronic disease management and urgent care for several thousand of our employees in the area. There are multiple benefits and features to this program, including same-day and next-day appointments, on-site lab draws, medications and immunizations, mental health services and the ability to reach a care team 24/7 for urgent needs. In addition to our Atlanta facility, our U.S. employees have access to over 70 Everside Health clinics, and we are live in 37 states for virtual primary care. The safety and well-being of our employees is a top priority, and we believe offering this new benefit will lead to better health outcomes, allowing employees to live healthier lives. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our business. Congratulations, Jerry."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our second quarter 2022 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement disclaimer, and then we'll begin. Thank you, Julie. I'm very pleased to report that Rollins delivered a very strong financial performance in the second quarter and remains well positioned to deliver on our long-term business objectives. On today's call, I'm excited to share our strategic management succession plan that has been unanimously approved by our Board of Directors. We firmly believe that this is the right time to initiate this important leadership transition. Effective January 1, 2023, Jerry Gahlhoff, the Rollins Chief Operating Officer and President, will be elevated to the position of Chief Executive Officer or CEO. I'll remain Chairman of the Board, and Jerry will continue in his current role as President of Rollins. The following five months will be transitional while Jerry becomes more familiar with the areas involving his future responsibilities. The Company is well positioned financially and operationally. We have a proven management team, leading brands and a very strong culture. I'm extremely confident in the future of Rollins and look forward to working closely with Jerry to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. While I'll be moving away from the day-to-day operations, as I continue serving as our company Chairman of the Board, I will remain active and focused on our business goals and strategic plans. As many of you know, Jerry has been with Rollins since the 2008 acquisition of HomeTeam. And he's been instrumental in our success. What most don't know is that Jerry grew up in an Orkin household as his father worked for the Company for 26 years. His dad was a great employee. Jerry is an exceptional leader with great vision and a deep understanding of our industry and our customers. His years of service to Rollins has been marked by outstanding performance and accomplishments. He was promoted to Rollins President and Chief Operating Officer in 2020 and has had a unique opportunity to be intimately involved in most every facet of our organization. In 2021, Jerry joined the Rollins Board of Directors. His business acumen, leadership experience, strong sense of duty and his devotion to our company make him a natural fit to assume our President and Chief Executive Officer role. I have the utmost confidence that Jerry will continue to foster our strong company heritage record of accomplishments and promote the culture of Rollins. Let me now turn the call over to John Wilson, our Vice Chairman, who will provide some business updates. John? Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Thank you. We've done quite a bit of research as far as our price increases are concerned. And certainly, we would be opposed to having another price increase this year. We really studied the frequency and the amount very carefully. And it's been our experience that you really need to have some time in between and don't get greedy. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. And thanks again."

We'll be following that slide presentation on a call this morning, and encourage you to view that with us. On the line with me today and speaking are Gary Rollins, Rollins' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Wilson, Vice Chairman, Jerry Gahlhoff Jr. President and Chief Operating Officer and Julie Bimmerman, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks. And then we'll open the line for your questions. Gary, would you like to begin?\nGary Rollins: Yes. Thank you, Joe and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2022 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement, disclaimer, and then we will begin.\nJulie Bimmerman: Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and for our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term objectives. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters ahead. I would now like to give an update on our SEC investigation. Rollins reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission on April 18th. The settlement fully resolves the SEC's investigation into certain adjustments to accruals and reserves and their impact on reported earnings per share in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017. Rollins paid a $8 million civil penalty, which was fully accrued in a third and fourth quarters of 2021. Under terms of the settlement Rollins, neither admits or denies the SEC's findings in this matter. The settlement completes the SEC's investigation and there will be no restatement of Rollins financials related to this matter. I want to take a moment to highlight the actions that we've taken to strengthen Rollins controls and procedures to prevent something like this from happening in the future. From the beginning, we took this matter very seriously and hired outside consultants to evaluate and strengthen our financial reporting. This included improving processes, procedures, and supporting documentation, that impact financial results. We also hired a Chief Accounting Officer, Traci Hornfeck, last October and added two retired E&Y partners to our audit committee, Susan Bell and Pat Gunning. Susan currently serves as Chair of that committee. We have also hired and added several experienced accounting personnel to further strengthen our team. Jerry will share with you details of our active CFO search to further improve this area. It is noteworthy that the SEC recognizes within the order that Rollins \"cooperation and the remedial acts were promptly undertaken to prevent and detect the type of misconduct described in the order\". Out of respect for the process, we will not answer any questions during our Q&A on this matter. I assure you that integrity is at the core of who we are as a company. And we remain committed to doing the right thing for our employees, investors, and customers. And finally, we are pleased that this matter is resolved. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some business updates. John?\nJohn Wilson: Thank you and good morning everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter financial results, with revenue increasing to $590.7 million and net income totaling $72.4 million or $0.15 per share. Overall, we experience solid growth across our family of pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Over the past couple of years, we have been actively strengthening and solidifying our Board of Directors and board committees, reflecting our commitment to effective corporate governance. For those of you who are familiar with Rollins, our Board consists of outstanding directors who have diverse backgrounds and bring invaluable experience, strong governance and their unique perspectives to our company. As part of that process, our directors have also been a key component of driving Rollins long-term strategic vision. We are pleased to announce that Gregory Morrison has been recently appointed to Rollins audit committee. Some of you may recall that Greg who joined as a Director of Rollins in 2021 served 18 years as Vice President and Corporate Chief Information Officer for Cox Enterprises. At Cox, he was responsible for the management and operations of all information technology, including cybersecurity solutions, which we believe makes him particularly well suited to join the audit committee. In addition to his responsibilities as a member of our Board's human capital management and compensation committee. We are also pleased to announce that Don Carson has been appointed to our nominating and governance committee. Don also joined our Board in 2021 and is a trusted advisor to Catheter Precision, where he also serves as a Director. Don also acts as a trustee for The Cook and Bynum Fund. Furthermore, we strengthened our Board with the recent selection of seasoned and executive Louise Sams. Louise has also been appointed to our nominating and governance committee and the compensation committee. For almost 20 years, Louise was an Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Turner Broadcasting System. As General Counsel, Louise oversaw legal work relating to Turner's business activities and at subsidiaries worldwide, including licensing and production of content for Turner Television. She was also involved in the sale and distribution of those networks. The protection of intellectual property, employment matters, as well as litigation and transactional work relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. Most recently, Louise focused on issues related to technology, information security, use of data and consumer privacy, as well as enterprise-wide risk management. We are pleased to have Louise joint our Board, and we believe her broad experience will help to further strengthen Rollins and guide our strategic direction. At our core, we are foremost a service company. Our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. Toward this end, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter Rollins was awarded a 2022 top workplaces award by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Rollins will rank 17th in the large business category, marking the sixth consecutive year we've received this award. This recognition is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution and leadership, more than 2,900 Atlanta companies participated in this program. And over 68,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. Another recent recognition that I am particularly proud of is that Newsweek ranked Rollins number eight in their article on America's Most Trustworthy Companies for 2022 in the consulting and professional services category. Over 110,000 of valuations were collected and reviewed regarding customer trust, investor trust and employee trust to receive this recognition. We remain committed to providing a workplace where our team members can grow professionally and have a positive impact on the community and many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve all the credit for Rollins achieving these honors. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John and hello everyone. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 first quarter financial results, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the quarter. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our numbers. Rollins first quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 10.3% to $590.7 million compared to $535.6 million in last year's first quarter. Net income was $72.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share. This is compared to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. This decline in EPS was primarily the result of last year's gain on the sale of Clark properties. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, all our business lines experience good growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 10.2%, commercial pest control rising 9.1% and termite increasing 13.3%. On the expense side, in the first quarter, we felt significant inflationary pressures in fleet and pest control materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these and an overview of the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these expense pressures. As you may recall from last quarter, we've been proactively addressing supply chain issues and our termite and ancillary service offerings. With our procurement team seeking alternate products and suppliers, while our operation teams have been successfully initiated increases in our rate card pricing where needed to counteract the rise in some of these material costs. We believe we've struck the right balance and these efforts are helping to bring material costs back in line for our termite and ancillary business. In the first quarter, we began experiencing similar inflationary headwinds within our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. Given the successes we've achieved, mitigating M&S costs in termite, we're implementing a proactive approach within our pest control business by adjusting our rate cards and diversifying through alternative suppliers and also by seeking shipping and freight efficiencies. Most important to improve our profit margin, we're also implementing our annual price increase programs earlier this year. These more aggressive price increases were initiated within all our brands in late spring as compared to typical timing of the early summer months in prior years. In short, we're proactive managing through this. Our fuel expense is an important example. We gave up seven tenths of a point in margin to increases in fleet expense in Q1. Through extensive routing and scheduling initiatives, we have reduced our overall mileage necessary, which lowers our fuel requirements. For our first quarter of 2022, our fuel would've been approximately $700,000 higher if we had not begun these routing and scheduling processes. This equates to an estimated addition of over 3.2 million miles driven if our miles between stops had not been reduced using our routing and scheduling technologies. We expect that we will see ongoing benefits of these improvements as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Furthermore, we continue to increase the number of hybrid and electric vehicles in our fleet, as we now have over 800 currently deployed. Next for a quick update on our acquisition pipeline. Fortunately, it's full. We have plenty of potential opportunity that we're actively engaged with. Our acquisition team has been busy, both domestic and internationally. One of our latest acquisitions highlighted in a recent press release NBC Environment, headquartered in the U.K., closed April 1st and now gives us full coverage within the U.K., including multiple locations within Scotland. Before closing, I'd like to provide an update on our Chief Financial Officer search. While we don't have an announcement to make today, we have engaged an executive search firm to assist with identifying an exceptional candidate to join our leadership team. We are focused on getting a seasoned, talented financial executive as our CFO. The search is progressing well, and we look forward to providing an update this summer. Julie has been filling in remarkably as our Interim CFO, and you can all rest assure that Julie will be remaining with Rollins as our Group Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. I know that I sleep better at night knowing that. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are of our first quarter results, given the inflationary pressures we faced and remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Bimmerman: Thank you, Jerry. We delivered a strong first quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial me metrics. Like last quarter, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discussed during today's earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. Now onto the numbers. Our first quarter revenues of $590.7 million was an increase of 10.3% actual exchange rate and 7% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth totaled 9.6%, with 6.3% organic. As previously mentioned residential, commercial and termite all presented strong growth for the quarter. Residential grew 10.2%, 5.8% organic, commercial grew 9.1%, 7.9% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.3% with 5 8, excuse me, with 8.5% organic. Now onto our income. For the first quarter, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties of $31 million in Q1 of last year. First quarter EBITDA 2022 was $117.8 million or 4.2% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. First quarter 2022 EPS was $0.15 per diluted share or 7.1% improvement over 2021 adjusted EPS. For the first quarter 2022, gross margin decreased to 50% or 1.2 points below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q1, 2022, primarily from fuel in the amount of $4.6 million and vehicle repairs of $1.2 million over last year. Combined, these fleet expense increases equated to seven tenths of a point in additional cost. Service salaries were up four tenths of a point, while pest control materials and supplies were up $2.9 million or one 10th of a point. Fuel increases were driven by a 42% increase in average price paid per gallon in Q1, 2022, over 2021. This along with customer growth brought a 55% increase in our total fuel cost for the quarter. The service wages increase was a combination of COVID sick time taken and overtime paid to cover work for employees out sick with COVID. We face some difficult challenges in January as our reported number of employees testing positive for COVID-19 increased 154% over January, 2021. Additional overtime pay required to complete our routes and cover for these COVID cases contributed to a 21% increase over Q1, 2021. We believe this to be a one-time event unless another COVID surge occurs. Sales, general and administrative, or SG&A on the other hand, held flat Q1, 2022, over 2021 with both quarters coming in at 30.3%. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends for Q1, 2022 totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 25% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions declined 22% to $13.2 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $258.3 million in cash, of which $86.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As you've probably noted, we have also increased our term loan over last year. This will put us in a strong position to act quickly on either potential acquisitions or stock repurchases as opportunities may arise. Now to free cash flow. For the quarter of 2022, our free cash was $79.5 million or a decrease of 28.8% over last year. The decline was related to $30.6 million in payroll taxes deferred under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, in 2022 and subsequently paid in the third quarter of 2021. In comparing the current first quarter to last year, the deferral was within the Q1, 2021 operating activities. Last, I am please to share that yesterday the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2022 to shareholders of a record at the close of business May 10th, 2022. This represents a 25% increase over the dividends paid in June, 2021. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the quarter of 2022, accentuates our financial strength, the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn the call back to you.\nGary Rollins: Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nTim Mulrooney: Gary, Julie, Jerry, John, good morning.\nJulie Bimmerman: Good morning.\nGary Rollins: Good morning.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning.\nTim Mulrooney: Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just had a couple about pricing, and I appreciate the color that Jerry gave. But the first one is, pricing is typically, call it, 1% to 2%. How much do you expect it to be this year? I mean, we've spoken to several regional providers who are talking about price increases of more than 5% this year. So, we're wondering if Orkin is thinking along the same lines.\nJulie Bimmerman: So, I'll start with this and then any of the guys can jump in if they want to add to that, Tim. As you know, our price increase will typically equate to 1% to 2% of our overall growth. And we have said bringing it 4% earlier this year and the fact that we are being more aggressive than we do expect it to increase over that. We're obviously not going to give you an exact number. As you know, we -- I'll never really do that. But keep in mind what this means by being more aggressive is there are customers that in the past that we may have considered not doing the increase or holding off a little bit longer, we'll do that. Also, there may be some areas that we may push that envelope a little bit and increase it higher by -- region by region.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah. Tim, this is Jerry. We took a hard look and as we said, we've been more aggressive than we probably ever have been in the future. And we looked at it as to from a standpoint of what will the market bear and we've just been considerably more aggressive than we have in prior years with our percentage increases.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Well, I'll take what I can get. Thank you. Maybe for my follow-up on pricing, can you talk a little bit about -- look, I think we know how it works on the residential side, you send out your price increase in the second quarter every year. So we -- that makes sense. But on the commercial side, I think it could be a little more nuanced, please correct me if I'm wrong. But I mean, my question, I guess, is, are there opportunities for pricing conversations every time you visit a commercial customer, or is it once per year or is the price fixed through the duration of the contract length? Could you just give us a little more insight on how that dynamic occurs on the commercial side?\nJohn Wilson: Tim, yeah. This is John. I'll take that. I guess, the easy answer is it depends. It depends entirely on that that customer, the contract arrangement and where we are in terms of service duration. Most of our commercial customers sort of equate service duration to the price they pay. And so, if -- we get some pretty robust reporting out of our systems to provide our managers and field sales folks with the information they need to then kind of have that conversation if service durations are exceeding kind of what our revenue per hour goal might be. So, it just depends entirely on the customer and where they are relative to all that.\nGary Rollins: I'd like to add something, John. This is Gary. We have been doing price increases on a consistent program or a routine program for the last 20-plus years. And we have a tremendous database that we're able to compare the price that the customer is paying related to the current rate card, look at the exact gap, if you will, between the rate card and the price and study quite carefully what the results are going to be and so forth. So, I think it it's not a hit or miss deal. And we measure rollbacks. This would be a situation where the customer objects and we feel like -- customer is certainly profitable obviously. But we've learned that that really there's not much difference between the customers that are being rolled back. In other words, we have branches that rollback very few, maybe 10% of their customers. So, we really share that data and -- which really kind of adds integrity to what we're doing, because there there's no need to change the pricing. And then we even get something. Our attitude is, they may not have -- maybe not require the full amount of the pricing increase, but we do get some amount. So, this is something that we've been watching carefully, and it's made a big difference to our company.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would add, Tim. This is Jerry, that we were just as aggressive within our brands if not in some brands, more aggressive on the commercial side than residential even. So, we were -- we definitely touched the commercial business in a great way as it relates to price increase.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. That's great color. Thank you everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe on the gross margins, just given all the mitigations that you put together in terms of price increases as well as scheduling, is it fair for us to assume that the rent of the headwinds were faced in the first quarter and those headwinds moderate going forward? And again, I understand you don't give guidance, but is there a way to think about when does it inflect from being a headwind to potentially being -- where we start to start seeing gross margin expansion? Could that -- could we start to see that in the back half of the year, or do we need to wait for next to really start gross margin expanding again? Thanks.\nJulie Bimmerman: I'll start on that and then let everyone else jump in. So, basically, yes. On the service salaries we were talking -- we do believe that that is something that we have overcome, because we do believe that that is related to the COVID experience that we had in the early part of the year. So, unless as I say another wave of COVID comes through, we believe that we're done with that.  Also as Jerry commented, as far as the pest control M&S, yes, we're taking care of that and going through and adjusting through our procurement group. And then, also through our rate cards to make sure that we take care of that, that leaves our fuel cost from that 10 point. And so, that's where our price increase will definitely be beneficial in helping cover that. And then also as our fleet group -- I think Jerry had commented that is shifting and looking at the type of vehicles that we're using and the ones that are coming into our fleet in the future. So, most of these or half of these expenses that we're talking about, we are -- we do believe are -- were beyond those. Jerry, do you want to jump in on anything?\nJerry Gahlhoff: As we also move through the year on this fuel side, we started seeing those -- the price increases in fuel by mid-year. And some of that will be a little more in our run rate of what we're accustomed to as we move through the year as well. So, there's -- that headwind will be mitigated from a year-over-year comparison standpoint as we move through the year.\nJulie Bimmerman: And let me add one last thing is the fact that Jerry had commented is keep in mind with our price increase coming in, we've actually brought that forward to where it is going in earlier as well to help mitigate those costs.\nGary Rollins: If I could add something, most of our pest control technicians have an element of productivity and their pay plans. So, when we raised the customer's price, the technician benefits from that as well. So, it's kind of a win-win situation and makes you feel good that they're getting a raise too.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color. Thank you very much. And maybe if I can ask a quick follow-up on the M&A pipeline. As you mentioned, M&A pipeline is pretty solid. I was just wondering if you could comment on the valuation. And also, on the last call, there was a comment made around restructuring foreign entities to make cash available from foreign operations more readily. So, would it be fair for us to assume that we could potentially see bigger M&A in the international markets as well? Any comments on that front? Thanks.\nJulie Bimmerman: I'll address the second part of that, which was on the -- we talked about the foreign subsidiaries -- or excuse me -- the cash held by foreign subsidiaries. As you noted, we had -- I believe, it was $86 million held at the end of March. Our acquisition that occurred on April 1st in the U.K., NBC was a prime example of how when we have those funds already on the -- within the foreign soil. We can use those for the acquisitions immediately and -- which we do so at that time. And we're always looking for acquisitions. We do not earmark our dollars to be domestic or international, wherever that next right company, the one that has the correct culture fit is the direction -- the acquisition we will make. So, just understand that we do not say that these dollars have to be for one or the other. Did you want to address anything else on the pipeline?\nJerry Gahlhoff: And I would add on the valuation part. We really haven't seen a significant change in valuation in the market. I think, it's still a very competitive acquisition market. There's probably more private equity players involved now than there were even two years ago. There's still plenty of competition there on the valuation side that's keeping the prices of some of these businesses fairly well propped up.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks again. Very helpful color and congrats on the strong momentum in the business. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. \nMario Cortellacci: Hi, guys. Really appreciate the time. Just my first question around kind of what the organic growth looks like in Q2, or in the back half of the year. You guys are coming up on tougher comps. I know that you guys have ramped your Salesforce as well. So, maybe you could just help us understand how much pricing is playing into helping alleviate some of that comp pressure? And then, also how much that extra Salesforce capacity that you guys have will help potentially maintain high single digit growth in Q2 and the back half of the year?\nJohn Wilson: So, Mario, this is John. I'll start and then maybe Jerry might have something to add. So, I think, when you look at the -- with the -- our business by the kind of the service line, the residential after two years of really pretty explosive growth, we'll -- I think we saw it soften in the first quarter and I think that will continue, especially given some of the weather challenges in the first four months or so of the year. But I think where the Salesforce's expansion that you mentioned will help us is on the commercial and the termite side. And I would expect our organic growth there to remain in that high single digit that you mentioned.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And this is Jerry. We think -- John is absolutely right about commercial and termite that ramped up the Salesforce. I would add to the color that spring hasn't fully sprung. In that when we look at our call center data -- and you just look at the call volume from existing customers that are calling in because I have -- I need an extra service or I see something. We just see that the volume isn't quite there yet that we would expect. I think we're probably weeks late from a seasonal standpoint as well. So, we'll probably have some better color around that as we move through Q2 and see how the weather plays out and what that one spring -- one spring has sprung, we will probably have a better feel for that residential pest control side.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. I appreciate it. And then, just for my follow-up, I haven't asked you guys about this in a while. Just around technology and kind of connected technology or connected tools. How penetrated are you within your customer base on that connected technology front? I'm assuming it's probably more weighted towards the commercial customer base and the residential customer base. But any kind of quantification there would be extremely helpful. And maybe where do you think that could go over time? I mean, we're seeing in other industries where automation is helping reduce headcount or at least allow headcount to be used more efficiently. I'm just wondering if you guys have kind of thought about it internally about potential cost savings or efficiency through using kind of a connected products or Internet of Things type of tools.\nJerry Gahlhoff: The work that we've done technology-wise, you're right, is very heavily on the commercial side. And I would say, at this point in time, most of the technology that we're thinking about on the residential side, all has to do with customer communication and helps us -- helping us improve our relationships with customers to improve customer retention. We have not been as focused on automation and back office type stuff, although the routing and scheduling effects if -- automated scheduling and a lot of what were manual processes can be eliminated over time with that through the routing and scheduling technologies. But most of our technology on the residential side is focused on that relationship building with the customer communications, notifications. Hey, our truck is on the way. You can see the truck on its path coming to you, those types of things that we think will improve customer loyalty.\nMario Cortellacci: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much everybody for taking the question. So, I'd like to come back to price with a little different angle and clarity. The -- if I understand the way you're describing the timing of it, first quarter 2022 does not reflect the benefit of being more aggressive. And therefore, that's in front of us coming into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q.\nJulie Bimmerman: Exactly. You're thinking correctly, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And on the commercial growth, can you help us understand -- I'm trying to get a feel for the macro. So, this is as much as about your businesses that is a read through just given all the things that are going on a geopolitical basis. I have this sense that there's been a trend of new business formation happening in North America, but really began to ramp in the second half of last year. And that has not peaked. Do you think your commercial organic growth reflects that there is new business formation, meaning you're adding incremental new customers as opposed to upselling existing?\nJerry Gahlhoff: We're probably doing a better job at adding new customers and then adding services on to the existing. Yeah. We're growing through new customers.\nMichael Hoffman: So, you would support the idea that there's new business formation going on still that we have -- that has not peaked. So, whatever fears about slowing consumer demand and recessions and what have, you haven't seen that come through on somebody starting a business in the empty storefront that needs a pest service.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I don't know that there are start-ups from new businesses or it's just existing businesses making a change or initiating services for the first time. We really don't have much insight into that unfortunately for you, Michael. Sorry.\nMichael Hoffman: No. Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.\nGary Rollins: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We're optimistic about our opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Our earnings release discusses our business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual risks may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to today's press release and for our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for more information and the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. Thank you, Jerry. We delivered a strong first quarter highlighted by significant growth across many key financial me metrics. Like last quarter, we are including a slide deck on our website, which presents the numbers we discussed during today's earnings call presentation. To view the deck, please go to rollins.com, click on news and events, then presentation. Now onto the numbers. Our first quarter revenues of $590.7 million was an increase of 10.3% actual exchange rate and 7% organic. For the constant exchange rate, the total revenue growth totaled 9.6%, with 6.3% organic. As previously mentioned residential, commercial and termite all presented strong growth for the quarter. Residential grew 10.2%, 5.8% organic, commercial grew 9.1%, 7.9% organic. Lastly, we have termite which grew 13.3% with 5 8, excuse me, with 8.5% organic. Now onto our income. For the first quarter, we are presenting adjusted EBITDA for comparison purposes due to the impact of our gain on sale of several of our Clark properties of $31 million in Q1 of last year. First quarter EBITDA 2022 was $117.8 million or 4.2% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $113 million. First quarter 2022 EPS was $0.15 per diluted share or 7.1% improvement over 2021 adjusted EPS. For the first quarter 2022, gross margin decreased to 50% or 1.2 points below last year. As mentioned, fleet created another quarter of strong headwinds in Q1, 2022, primarily from fuel in the amount of $4.6 million and vehicle repairs of $1.2 million over last year. Combined, these fleet expense increases equated to seven tenths of a point in additional cost. Service salaries were up four tenths of a point, while pest control materials and supplies were up $2.9 million or one 10th of a point. Fuel increases were driven by a 42% increase in average price paid per gallon in Q1, 2022, over 2021. This along with customer growth brought a 55% increase in our total fuel cost for the quarter. The service wages increase was a combination of COVID sick time taken and overtime paid to cover work for employees out sick with COVID. We face some difficult challenges in January as our reported number of employees testing positive for COVID-19 increased 154% over January, 2021. Additional overtime pay required to complete our routes and cover for these COVID cases contributed to a 21% increase over Q1, 2021. We believe this to be a one-time event unless another COVID surge occurs. Sales, general and administrative, or SG&A on the other hand, held flat Q1, 2022, over 2021 with both quarters coming in at 30.3%. Now for a few notes regarding our cash flow. Our dividends for Q1, 2022 totaled $49.2 million or an increase of 25% over 2021, while cash used for acquisitions declined 22% to $13.2 million for 2022. We ended the current period with $258.3 million in cash, of which $86.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As you've probably noted, we have also increased our term loan over last year. This will put us in a strong position to act quickly on either potential acquisitions or stock repurchases as opportunities may arise. Now to free cash flow. For the quarter of 2022, our free cash was $79.5 million or a decrease of 28.8% over last year. The decline was related to $30.6 million in payroll taxes deferred under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, in 2022 and subsequently paid in the third quarter of 2021. In comparing the current first quarter to last year, the deferral was within the Q1, 2021 operating activities. Last, I am please to share that yesterday the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.10 per share that will be paid on June 10th, 2022 to shareholders of a record at the close of business May 10th, 2022. This represents a 25% increase over the dividends paid in June, 2021. The dividend increase reflects our strong performance in the quarter of 2022, accentuates our financial strength, the Board's confidence in our outlook for continued growth. Gary, I'll turn the call back to you. Good morning. So, I'll start with this and then any of the guys can jump in if they want to add to that, Tim. As you know, our price increase will typically equate to 1% to 2% of our overall growth. And we have said bringing it 4% earlier this year and the fact that we are being more aggressive than we do expect it to increase over that. We're obviously not going to give you an exact number. As you know, we -- I'll never really do that. But keep in mind what this means by being more aggressive is there are customers that in the past that we may have considered not doing the increase or holding off a little bit longer, we'll do that. Also, there may be some areas that we may push that envelope a little bit and increase it higher by -- region by region. I'll start on that and then let everyone else jump in. So, basically, yes.

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John and hello everyone. I'd now like to walk through our 2022 first quarter financial results, focusing on items that directly impacted our operations during the quarter. Julie will address the non-GAAP adjustments a little later. Looking at our numbers. Rollins first quarter 2022 was highlighted by revenue growth of 10.3% to $590.7 million compared to $535.6 million in last year's first quarter. Net income was $72.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share. This is compared to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. This decline in EPS was primarily the result of last year's gain on the sale of Clark properties. As mentioned, Julie will review GAAP and non-GAAP results as well as organic revenue growth numbers shortly. Operationally, all our business lines experience good growth during the quarter, with residential pest control up 10.2%, commercial pest control rising 9.1% and termite increasing 13.3%. On the expense side, in the first quarter, we felt significant inflationary pressures in fleet and pest control materials and supplies. I'll give insight on these and an overview of the actions we've been implementing to mitigate these expense pressures. As you may recall from last quarter, we've been proactively addressing supply chain issues and our termite and ancillary service offerings. With our procurement team seeking alternate products and suppliers, while our operation teams have been successfully initiated increases in our rate card pricing where needed to counteract the rise in some of these material costs. We believe we've struck the right balance and these efforts are helping to bring material costs back in line for our termite and ancillary business. In the first quarter, we began experiencing similar inflationary headwinds within our residential and commercial pest control materials and supplies. Given the successes we've achieved, mitigating M&S costs in termite, we're implementing a proactive approach within our pest control business by adjusting our rate cards and diversifying through alternative suppliers and also by seeking shipping and freight efficiencies. Most important to improve our profit margin, we're also implementing our annual price increase programs earlier this year. These more aggressive price increases were initiated within all our brands in late spring as compared to typical timing of the early summer months in prior years. In short, we're proactive managing through this. Our fuel expense is an important example. We gave up seven tenths of a point in margin to increases in fleet expense in Q1. Through extensive routing and scheduling initiatives, we have reduced our overall mileage necessary, which lowers our fuel requirements. For our first quarter of 2022, our fuel would've been approximately $700,000 higher if we had not begun these routing and scheduling processes. This equates to an estimated addition of over 3.2 million miles driven if our miles between stops had not been reduced using our routing and scheduling technologies. We expect that we will see ongoing benefits of these improvements as we move throughout the remainder of the year. Furthermore, we continue to increase the number of hybrid and electric vehicles in our fleet, as we now have over 800 currently deployed. Next for a quick update on our acquisition pipeline. Fortunately, it's full. We have plenty of potential opportunity that we're actively engaged with. Our acquisition team has been busy, both domestic and internationally. One of our latest acquisitions highlighted in a recent press release NBC Environment, headquartered in the U.K., closed April 1st and now gives us full coverage within the U.K., including multiple locations within Scotland. Before closing, I'd like to provide an update on our Chief Financial Officer search. While we don't have an announcement to make today, we have engaged an executive search firm to assist with identifying an exceptional candidate to join our leadership team. We are focused on getting a seasoned, talented financial executive as our CFO. The search is progressing well, and we look forward to providing an update this summer. Julie has been filling in remarkably as our Interim CFO, and you can all rest assure that Julie will be remaining with Rollins as our Group Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. I know that I sleep better at night knowing that. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to emphasize how pleased we are of our first quarter results, given the inflationary pressures we faced and remain well positioned for 2022. I'll now turn the call over to Julie. Good morning. Yeah. Tim, this is Jerry. We took a hard look and as we said, we've been more aggressive than we probably ever have been in the future. And we looked at it as to from a standpoint of what will the market bear and we've just been considerably more aggressive than we have in prior years with our percentage increases. I would add, Tim. This is Jerry, that we were just as aggressive within our brands if not in some brands, more aggressive on the commercial side than residential even. So, we were -- we definitely touched the commercial business in a great way as it relates to price increase. As we also move through the year on this fuel side, we started seeing those -- the price increases in fuel by mid-year. And some of that will be a little more in our run rate of what we're accustomed to as we move through the year as well. So, there's -- that headwind will be mitigated from a year-over-year comparison standpoint as we move through the year. And I would add on the valuation part. We really haven't seen a significant change in valuation in the market. I think, it's still a very competitive acquisition market. There's probably more private equity players involved now than there were even two years ago. There's still plenty of competition there on the valuation side that's keeping the prices of some of these businesses fairly well propped up. And this is Jerry. We think -- John is absolutely right about commercial and termite that ramped up the Salesforce. I would add to the color that spring hasn't fully sprung. In that when we look at our call center data -- and you just look at the call volume from existing customers that are calling in because I have -- I need an extra service or I see something. We just see that the volume isn't quite there yet that we would expect. I think we're probably weeks late from a seasonal standpoint as well. So, we'll probably have some better color around that as we move through Q2 and see how the weather plays out and what that one spring -- one spring has sprung, we will probably have a better feel for that residential pest control side. The work that we've done technology-wise, you're right, is very heavily on the commercial side.

            "content": "Thank you and good morning everyone. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter financial results, with revenue increasing to $590.7 million and net income totaling $72.4 million or $0.15 per share. Overall, we experience solid growth across our family of pest management brands and continue to achieve strong levels of customer growth. Over the past couple of years, we have been actively strengthening and solidifying our Board of Directors and board committees, reflecting our commitment to effective corporate governance. For those of you who are familiar with Rollins, our Board consists of outstanding directors who have diverse backgrounds and bring invaluable experience, strong governance and their unique perspectives to our company. As part of that process, our directors have also been a key component of driving Rollins long-term strategic vision. We are pleased to announce that Gregory Morrison has been recently appointed to Rollins audit committee. Some of you may recall that Greg who joined as a Director of Rollins in 2021 served 18 years as Vice President and Corporate Chief Information Officer for Cox Enterprises. At Cox, he was responsible for the management and operations of all information technology, including cybersecurity solutions, which we believe makes him particularly well suited to join the audit committee. In addition to his responsibilities as a member of our Board's human capital management and compensation committee. We are also pleased to announce that Don Carson has been appointed to our nominating and governance committee. Don also joined our Board in 2021 and is a trusted advisor to Catheter Precision, where he also serves as a Director. Don also acts as a trustee for The Cook and Bynum Fund. Furthermore, we strengthened our Board with the recent selection of seasoned and executive Louise Sams. Louise has also been appointed to our nominating and governance committee and the compensation committee. For almost 20 years, Louise was an Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Turner Broadcasting System. As General Counsel, Louise oversaw legal work relating to Turner's business activities and at subsidiaries worldwide, including licensing and production of content for Turner Television. She was also involved in the sale and distribution of those networks. The protection of intellectual property, employment matters, as well as litigation and transactional work relating to acquisitions and joint ventures. Most recently, Louise focused on issues related to technology, information security, use of data and consumer privacy, as well as enterprise-wide risk management. We are pleased to have Louise joint our Board, and we believe her broad experience will help to further strengthen Rollins and guide our strategic direction. At our core, we are foremost a service company. Our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. Toward this end, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter Rollins was awarded a 2022 top workplaces award by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Rollins will rank 17th in the large business category, marking the sixth consecutive year we've received this award. This recognition is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution and leadership, more than 2,900 Atlanta companies participated in this program. And over 68,000 of their employees were surveyed about their workplace experience. Another recent recognition that I am particularly proud of is that Newsweek ranked Rollins number eight in their article on America's Most Trustworthy Companies for 2022 in the consulting and professional services category. Over 110,000 of valuations were collected and reviewed regarding customer trust, investor trust and employee trust to receive this recognition. We remain committed to providing a workplace where our team members can grow professionally and have a positive impact on the community and many thanks go to our leadership team who deserve all the credit for Rollins achieving these honors. Now, let me turn the call over to Jerry who will provide more details on our business. Tim, yeah. This is John. I'll take that. I guess, the easy answer is it depends. It depends entirely on that that customer, the contract arrangement and where we are in terms of service duration. Most of our commercial customers sort of equate service duration to the price they pay. And so, if -- we get some pretty robust reporting out of our systems to provide our managers and field sales folks with the information they need to then kind of have that conversation if service durations are exceeding kind of what our revenue per hour goal might be. So, it just depends entirely on the customer and where they are relative to all that. So, Mario, this is John. I'll start and then maybe Jerry might have something to add. So, I think, when you look at the -- with the -- our business by the kind of the service line, the residential after two years of really pretty explosive growth, we'll -- I think we saw it soften in the first quarter and I think that will continue, especially given some of the weather challenges in the first four months or so of the year. But I think where the Salesforce's expansion that you mentioned will help us is on the commercial and the termite side. And I would expect our organic growth there to remain in that high single digit that you mentioned."

            "name": "Gary Rollins",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Joe and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2022 investor call. Julie will read our forward-looking statement, disclaimer, and then we will begin. Thank you, Julie. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term objectives. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters ahead. I would now like to give an update on our SEC investigation. Rollins reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission on April 18th. The settlement fully resolves the SEC's investigation into certain adjustments to accruals and reserves and their impact on reported earnings per share in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017. Rollins paid a $8 million civil penalty, which was fully accrued in a third and fourth quarters of 2021. Under terms of the settlement Rollins, neither admits or denies the SEC's findings in this matter. The settlement completes the SEC's investigation and there will be no restatement of Rollins financials related to this matter. I want to take a moment to highlight the actions that we've taken to strengthen Rollins controls and procedures to prevent something like this from happening in the future. From the beginning, we took this matter very seriously and hired outside consultants to evaluate and strengthen our financial reporting. This included improving processes, procedures, and supporting documentation, that impact financial results. We also hired a Chief Accounting Officer, Traci Hornfeck, last October and added two retired E&Y partners to our audit committee, Susan Bell and Pat Gunning. Susan currently serves as Chair of that committee. We have also hired and added several experienced accounting personnel to further strengthen our team. Jerry will share with you details of our active CFO search to further improve this area. It is noteworthy that the SEC recognizes within the order that Rollins \"cooperation and the remedial acts were promptly undertaken to prevent and detect the type of misconduct described in the order\". Out of respect for the process, we will not answer any questions during our Q&A on this matter. I assure you that integrity is at the core of who we are as a company. And we remain committed to doing the right thing for our employees, investors, and customers. And finally, we are pleased that this matter is resolved. With that, let me turn the call over to John who will provide some business updates. John? Thank you, Julie. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Good morning. I'd like to add something, John. This is Gary. We have been doing price increases on a consistent program or a routine program for the last 20-plus years. And we have a tremendous database that we're able to compare the price that the customer is paying related to the current rate card, look at the exact gap, if you will, between the rate card and the price and study quite carefully what the results are going to be and so forth. So, I think it it's not a hit or miss deal. And we measure rollbacks. This would be a situation where the customer objects and we feel like -- customer is certainly profitable obviously. But we've learned that that really there's not much difference between the customers that are being rolled back. In other words, we have branches that rollback very few, maybe 10% of their customers. So, we really share that data and -- which really kind of adds integrity to what we're doing, because there there's no need to change the pricing. And then we even get something. Our attitude is, they may not have -- maybe not require the full amount of the pricing increase, but we do get some amount. So, this is something that we've been watching carefully, and it's made a big difference to our company. If I could add something, most of our pest control technicians have an element of productivity and their pay plans. So, when we raised the customer's price, the technician benefits from that as well. So, it's kind of a win-win situation and makes you feel good that they're getting a raise too. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We're optimistic about our opportunities ahead and appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our progress. Thank you again."

Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was an outstanding year for Rollins as we achieved a milestone of $3.1 billion in revenue. Demand from our customers remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. While full-year revenue increased 14% versus last year, we grew earnings per share by over 18% and adjusted earnings per share by 20%, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and a commitment to continuous improvement in our business. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter and observed sustained strength in the pest control markets we serve. We also continue to drive share gains in our markets by leveraging a multi-brand, multichannel approach at scale to differentiate ourselves competitively. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods help us reach new customers and enhance engagement with existing customers to support organic growth. We have also strategically allocated resources to the commercial side of our business to capitalize on opportunities within key verticals. Most notably, we have grown our sales force and invested in training and tools to enable their success. Our service quality is high, and our offerings are customized, which helps new sales professionals gain confidence and become successful quickly. Additionally, we are leveraging the scale of our Orkin brand across North America to effectively serve commercial customers coast-to-coast in both the U.S. and Canada. While we're still early with respect to our efforts in this area, we see good results as demonstrated by approximately 11% commercial revenue growth for the year. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. And in 2023, we welcomed 24 new businesses into our company through acquisition. This includes the addition of Fox Pest Control, which was the second largest acquisition in our company's history. Our synergistic approach to integration has gone well with the Fox team exceeding the financial targets we outlined last April. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we divested certain non-core businesses, most notably our lawn care business, which includes insect, fertilization, and weed control for turf grafts. We recognized a pretax gain on sales of that transaction of approximately $15 million. The decision to divest this asset aligns with our strategy to focus on profitable growth in core pest control operations. Operationally, we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams. The hiring environment improved in 2023 as we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions as well as the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing levels help us capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year. 2023 was also an important year with respect to continuous improvement and safety was a key area of focus for us. During the year, we implemented an app that monitors driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. The app protects unsafe driving maneuvers associated with acceleration, breaking and speed, then converts data collected into a driver safety score. I'm pleased to report that by year-end, our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor increased over 30% from the beginning of the year, but we aren't stopping there. Improving the safety culture isn't something that is done overnight. But we are proud of the progress we have made and have set ambitious goals for ourselves to encourage safe behaviors throughout our organization. We believe these efforts will improve our ability to serve customers, help mitigate potentially negative financial impacts on our business and most importantly, ensure our people return home safe every day. Our continuous improvement efforts also set our own initiatives to modernize our back office and support functions. This is a work in progress, but we took some important steps to upgrade talent and systems during the year. These efforts are aimed at further enabling our growth priorities and increasing productivity as we work to become a better, more effective provider of shared services for our brands. In closing, our performance in 2023 demonstrates the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of pest control brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience and investing meaningfully in our team to drive growth both organically, as well as through disciplined acquisitions. We're pleased with where our business stands today and the momentum we carry into 2024. And I want to thank each of our 19,000 plus associates around the world for their efforts and contribution to our success in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect continued strong execution by the team. Let me begin with a few highlights for 2023. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of 14% for the year with double-digit growth across each of our service offerings. It was encouraging to see organic growth of 8% for the year, while acquisitions continue to be a meaningful part of our growth profile, accounting for approximately 6% of our total revenue growth. Second, we made good progress on profitability improvement in 2023. Full-year gross margins were healthy as we were positive on the price cost equation and saw improvement across several key cost categories. Adjusted operating margin finished the year at 19.7%, improving 140 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. This translated into GAAP EPS of $0.89 per share, up over 18% for the year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 20% for the year. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of almost 30% for the year and on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 28% for the year. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $528 million and free cash flow of $495 million, both up over 13% versus last year. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying nearly $1 billion of capital in 2023 with a focus on investing for growth, while returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. Turning to our fourth quarter performance. The team delivered a strong quarter with revenue up 14% to $754 million. Currencies had a negligible impact on quarterly revenue growth. We saw a good balance of growth between organic and inorganic activities as organic revenue was up over 7% with acquisitions accounting for the other 7% of growth. Jerry mentioned that we divested certain non-core businesses in the quarter, most notably our lawn care business. The purchase price for the transaction was $18 million. We received $15 million in proceeds during 2023 and recorded a pretax gain of $15 million on the sale. This business doesn't provide the growth or profitability profile of our core pest control business. Going forward, we don't anticipate any significant divestitures associated with portfolio rationalization in the foreseeable future. In the fourth quarter, Residential revenues increased approximately 18%, Commercial Pest Controls rose nearly 11%, and Termite and Ancillary was up over 13%. Organic growth was healthy across the portfolio with growth of nearly 5% in Residential, approximately 9% in Commercial, and over 11% in Termite and Ancillary. We normally see a step down in revenue as well as growth in Q4 along with Q1 due to seasonality. Comparing Q4 this year to last year, we saw an acceleration in organic growth across all service lines. Gross margin improved 40 basis points to 50.9% in the quarter. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 30 basis points, we saw 10 basis points of improvement in organic margins as leverage from people costs and fleet offset pressure from materials and supplies and higher insurance-related costs. Gross profit also steps down in Q4 and Q1, primarily due to lower volume levels associated with the seasonality of our business I previously discussed. With that said, I'm pleased with the fourth quarter performance as we saw improvement year-over-year and recorded our highest Q4 gross margin level in the last several decades. Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points in the quarter. We saw nice leverage on people costs, which offset increased advertising and selling expense associated with the growth initiatives that Jerry discussed previously. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $139 million, up 16% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million, up over 20% versus the prior year on 14% total revenue growth. Quarterly EBITDA was $181 million, up 24% versus last year, and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24%, up 190 basis points versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million, up 14% and representing a 22.1% margin, flat versus last year. While we saw nice leverage with respect to both gross profit and SG&A, adjusted EBITDA margins were negatively impacted by about 40 basis points in the quarter due to lower non-operational gains on property and vehicle sales that were included in other income when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This impacted incremental EBITDA margins in the quarter as well. The effective tax rate was 25.8% for both the quarter and the full-year period. And for 2024, we're expecting an effective rate -- tax rate of approximately 26%. Quarterly GAAP net income was approximately $109 million or $0.22 per share, an increase of nearly 30% from $0.17 per share in the same period a year ago. For the fourth quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items that I mentioned earlier, totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. We also recognized the $15 million pretax benefit associated with a gain on the sale of our non-core business. Taking into account these adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $101 million or $0.21 per share, increasing over 23% from the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 24% in the quarter to $153 million. We generated $142 million of free cash flow on $109 million of GAAP earnings, a 22% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 100% for the quarter. Debt remains low and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross and net level. We continued to fund our dividend in the quarter. Going back to the fourth quarter of 2022, we have increased our dividend 45% and we remain committed to funding our growing dividend as cash flow improves. As we look to 2024, we remain encouraged by the strength of our markets and the execution by our team. We are focused on delivering another year of robust growth and healthy incremental margins, further complemented by a strategic and disciplined approach to M&A. From a pricing perspective, we remain focused on effectively pricing the value of our services to remain positive on the price cost equation. And we have begun to raise prices for 2024 in the first quarter at a rate that is consistent with 2023 levels. We also continue to be active in managing our rate cards. Our focus remains on driving consistent growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and compounding cash flow that will enable a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on investing in growth initiatives in our core market. Before I turn the call back to Jerry, I wanted to announce that we will be holding an investor and analyst conference on the morning of May 17th in New York City, where we will share more about our strategic priorities and how we are positioning ourselves for continued success in the future. We're looking forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks and months. But for now, please hold the date. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: Jerry, Ken, good morning.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning.\nKenneth Krause: Good morning.\nTim Mulrooney: A couple of questions here. On the resi organic growth, Ken, as you highlight, it decelerated from 7% to 5% from the third to the fourth quarter. But you're right. As I look at results historically, I do see a slight deceleration seasonally from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, typically. So could you just talk about what those seasonal factors are? Like onetime revenue or whatever else. And if that's the case, could you also talk about how your recurring -- your residential recurring revenue stream looked like in the fourth quarter?\nKenneth Krause: Certainly, Tim, I'll start, and then turn it over to Jerry for additional comments as well. But when we look at the business, the business, as you so well indicate has a high degree of recurring revenue. And so as a result, there is a consistent base to the revenue that we enjoy and we benefit from. The one thing that does have an impact on our business from time-to-time is what we call onetime type of service. And when we look at the quarter in the fourth quarter, we did see a decel and the deceleration in the rate of growth in those areas of our business. That's probably the largest area of impact on the revenue growth in the quarter. We were really encouraged, quite frankly with the level of growth that we continue to see from the recurring business. It was a healthy level of growth for us, despite being stacked up against last October, you may recall was more beneficial because hurricane season was pretty tough in September. And so some of that business pushed into the fourth quarter of last year. There's always puts and takes, of course, in this business with weather. But we continue to be pretty encouraged with respect to our growth, especially in the resi sector.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And I would add, Ken, as I think about residential pest control, your -- every other month in your quarterly service frequency offerings of your recurring base, that's your bread and butter. That is the healthiest indicator of what's going on in our business as we are growing our business, increasing our volumes and are we ending the year from a positive standpoint and customer -- in net customers -- net new customers to start the year, we certainly did that. And that quarterly and EOM pest control is your bread and butter and the onetime is that gravy on top. And sometimes you don't always get that gravy and that's what's really caused the slowdown in addition to the divestiture of the lawn care, that was about another $1 million on the residential side that also impacted that number in the quarter as well, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Okay. So there was a little less gravy in the fourth quarter, which implies that your recurring revenue in that business is above your stated organic growth in the fourth quarter. Am I correct on that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. Absolutely. Our recurring quarterly every other month service definitely outpaced our organic overall number.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. The other one for me, and thank you for that, is on digital [indiscernible]. You mentioned last quarter that digital marketing [indiscernible] were, I think the language was flat to down slightly. Correct me if I'm wrong about that. But I was just curious if that trend carried through the fourth quarter or if it moves up or down at all?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. So as we look at the digital queries we saw in the fourth quarter, the digital queries, we saw modest increases in the quarter versus the prior year. But we did -- so it did result in some healthy increases in lead starts and sales both from a digital as well as just overall in our business. We did see a lift there. It was certainly better than flat. It wasn't stellar performance, but it was an improvement year-over-year. So we believe we continue to benefit from a diversified approach that we're not overly reliant on all the digital space. And that's a key part of the formula in our organic growth.\nKenneth Krause: Yes. It's interesting, Jerry, just adding on to that. When we look at the business in the fourth quarter and as well as throughout the year, what really proves the point that we're continuing to see good cross-sell, and we always talk about additional ways we access the customer. And one area is the cross-sell and the Termite and Ancillary business is really representative of that. We continue to see really robust levels of demand on the Ancillary side of our business, which is driven a lot by that cross-sell activity that the team continued to execute upon.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you, Jerry and Ken. When my kids turn 16, I might try to hit you off from one of those driver monitoring systems.\nJerry Gahlhoff: It's a good idea. You should probably get on it yourself, too.\nTim Mulrooney: Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Haas with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Haas: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could remind us what level of price increase you had put in last year. And I know it's early in the year, but I'm curious if you're seeing any more sensitivity from customers to the price increase you're putting in this year versus last?\nKenneth Krause: So as we had talked about previously, Jason, we had passed along a 3% to 4% price increase in the prior year. We followed that on again this year with a similar price increase here in the first quarter, ahead of our heavier pest market season, which starts here later in the first quarter. So we're pretty -- in terms of what we're seeing on the customer side, we monitor that. We assess that, we look at churn, we look at cancellations, we look at rollbacks. We look at a number of different metrics. And we feel like the level that we're passing along is at a very healthy level and is representative of the value of our services.\nJason Haas: Got it. That's great to hear. And then as a follow-up question, I'm curious if you could just talk about competitive dynamics in the industry. I'm curious how your growth rates in 4Q compared to the industry? If you feel like you're still gaining share? And just if you see any opportunities for the share gains in the year ahead?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I mean we continue to have a highly fragmented market in this industry. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't necessarily characterize any significant shifts or changes in that competitiveness, it's always been that way. And while there are some ebbs and flows in here and there, we just keep doing what we do, focusing on our business and trying to win at what we do so.\nKenneth Krause: When we look at our growth, Jason, in the quarter at organic growth, which was north of 7%, and we think about how that fares relative to how we've discussed the business and also how we outperformed. We're pretty happy with the level of growth that we're seeing come through the business. And we also continue to have a high degree of optimism and we're encouraged about the future growth that we continue to see in this business. So we really look at how we're performing relative to our expectations, and we continue to perform at a level that we're pretty pleased with.\nJason Haas: Got it. That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Following up on the Residential business. Can you talk about what recurring revenue growth trends were? How did it perform relative to your earlier quarters? And what you see as the key drivers of growth acceleration going forward?\nKenneth Krause: Certainly, George. When we look at the growth rates and we look at their recurring revenue growth relative to prior quarters, the business continues to perform pretty well. It continues to hold in there. I mean Q4 always sees a step down and just generally the growth year-over-year. But it's above what we saw a year ago, and it continues to be at a healthy level. So there's nothing that's indicating that there's a significant decel in the growth rates or a different or a change in profile and the growth rates that we're seeing coming through our business.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And you talked about earlier, making good progress with bundling, cross-selling in door-to-door sales. Can you talk a little bit about your priorities for 2024 with respect to these areas and how you expect that to drive volume performance?\nKenneth Krause: Certainly, when you step back and you look at the business, George, we look at it across a number of different priorities. We -- and when we think about our expectations going forward, we talked earlier about our pricing. We're focused certainly on getting the value of our services through strategic pricing management. And we again raised prices and we'll continue to raise prices and manage our rate cards effectively. So that's one side of the equation. And so that rate -- that growth rate associated with pricing is at this point expected to be in line with what we saw a year ago at 3% to 4%. And then secondly, when we look at growth profile across the business, we remain encouraged by our position in our market. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver a healthy level of growth going forward that's in line with what we've seen here in the last couple of years. We've all enjoyed the benefit and you've seen the benefit of our growth rate accelerating post-COVID. We continue to operate at a pretty healthy level of growth in our business from an organic perspective. And then, of course, we saw a really robust uptick in growth associated with M&A in the last year. When we look at the initiatives across the business, the cross-sell is certainly really important, going after those customers that may have one service, but trying to add additional services like mosquito and ticks and other services like that. Continuing the focusing on the Termite and Ancillary business is very important. And then last but certainly not least, is the Commercial side. Jerry spoke about the Commercial business in detail, we talked about it in the third quarter as well. We continue to place this portion of focus on the Commercial business and driving growth there. So all of those initiatives are coming together to give us optimism as we think about our growth rates going forward.\nJerry Gahlhoff: George, I'll add. This is Jerry. When we think about one of the ways I just love our business model is the diversity that we get from our brand strategy. Each of our brands has various different ways to acquire customers, whether it be, say, Northwest and Home team that rely heavily on the homebuilding market or Fox doing door-to-door. And now, for example, we have Home team doing door-to-door and expanding that offering in their business by things they learn from the Fox team. These are all things that we can deploy across and due to the diversity of our brands and what each one brings to the table that we think continues to help us with this solid growth profile for the future.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Hoffman: So the challenge is to how creative can I be to ask four questions in two. Good morning, everybody.\nKenneth Krause: Good morning.\nMichael Hoffman: So things that would help the model, Ken, are specifics that I think you can share like the three to four and 1Q pricing. What is the dollar amount of the M&A rollover from '23, so everybody just gets that right? And how do you think about the cadence of it in the calendar year, so we just don't get that wrong?\nKenneth Krause: Certainly. When we look at M&A, we continue to be focused on M&A. We continue to focus on executing that disciplined strategy. We see roughly 2% carryover coming into 2024 from M&A. A large part of that, of course is here in the first quarter with Fox, we acquired Fox last April. So we still have one quarter of benefit. When we look at the pipeline, we see a healthy pipeline. We were very active to close out the year and then also to start 2024. January activity in deals that we closed are up. So we continue to chart towards that 2% plus level of growth, 2% to 3% plus level of growth associated with M&A as we go forward. But the carryover is around 2%.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then it's shared with us that incremental margins on an adjusted basis for 2029, both on an adjusted and adjusted 28%, 29%. What is the target for this year? And how does non-operating gains influence that? And maybe can you isolate what those gains were in '22 and '23, so we can understand how to think about them in '24. There's my creative question with four [indiscernible]?\nKenneth Krause: Certainly. When we look at the incremental margin profile, there's no reason -- I mean, we continue to see and have a confidence level in delivering 30% incremental margins. If you look at the incremental margin in the last several years, we've seen it step up. Our focus has been -- we've been laser-focused on incremental margins and driving improvements on the margin profile. And so when we think about that level, that's the range at 30%. We've seen quarters as high as 35% to 40%. So it will jump around from quarter-to-quarter. And you're going to see that. But generally, when we step back and we finished the year at 28% to 30%, we're pretty pleased. That means we're getting 70 basis points as we did of improvement in EBITDA margins. The gains on asset sales will come through. They came through in Q3 -- or I'm sorry, Q4 here. And we saw roughly $3 million lower asset sales that came through other income, about 40 basis points on the margin line and the EBITDA margin line. And that will come through from time-to-time. And we'll try to isolate that as we go forward for you.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I can ask a clarifying question on resi. Obviously, good to hear the recurring revenues within resi continue to do really well and the digital inquiries are also pretty stable. Just a question there is, have you seen any change, particularly from competitor pushing harder on the marketing spend, is that changing anything? Did that change anything in the fourth quarter? But maybe importantly, going into 2024, how should we think about the demand environment? You talked about a pretty solid demand environment. I was wondering if you could provide any color on cicadas and the two groups of cicadas coming or emerging in '24, what do would that mean for the demand environment? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Ashish, I'll -- this is Jerry. I'll kind of try to take the first part of that statement. I asked our marketing team what was going on in the fourth quarter from a digital spend standpoint. It was a time when we'd like to invest a little earlier in the year in some of the marketing. And it did appear anecdotally that there was a pretty significant uptick in competitive spend in the fourth quarter at a time when we were backing, winding down some of our marketing spend that there was some pretty significant investment in the market there in the fourth quarter. So we certainly saw the competitive environment pick up in that regard where there was more spend into there. Now how that equated to sales and starts to new customers or onetime work on the residential side, we don't really know. But -- so that's on your first question, that's...\nKenneth Krause: Yes. And the second part of your question, I think, it was around cicadas and new pests. And we continue to monitor new pest activity. Cicadas are one of the many pests that we continue to monitor. Jerry, I don't know if you want to add. I'm certainly not the expert when it comes to cicadas. You're probably much better positioned to answer that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. Well, cicadas typically are not a household pest control problem. They are a nuisance because when they come out and the volumes as they did a couple of years ago, they wreak havoc from a noise standpoint, I know -- I have a house in the mountains that you couldn't sleep at night, and it was very annoying. But they tend to just go away over time, but it probably will create some awareness about pests in general and things that bother humans, but it's not as though our pest control companies are going to be out there attempting to eradicate cicadas. So that's seemingly an impossible feat. We're really just out there waiting for them to die off and go away and start the whole process over again. So it will probably create some buzz in the marketplace, and that's always good for business.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe if I can ask a question on the back-office modernization. Ken, if you can just help us understand where you are on that process? And how should we think about that contribution to incremental EBITDA margins in '24, but also midterm? Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: Yes. We continue to be very early on in our journey with respect to modernization, making good progress. We've added a number of new team members across our back office, we've made some significant changes. But we're pretty excited about what's to come. With that said, when we look at the SG&A performance over time, we've continued to see that improve. Going back a couple of years, it was almost 31%. It's come down under 29% here in the quarter. So we continue to leverage that and despite having investments and growth initiatives associated with the commercial business as well as other parts of our business. And so we're early on in the journey. We feel like there's some opportunities as we go forward to continue to improve the business.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks. Very helpful and really strong momentum in commercial and ancillary services. So congrats on that.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Chan: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe bridging from the prior question on SG&A. I guess, you've done a really good job improving gross margin over the last several years. I guess from an SG&A perspective, is there an expectation that the leverage there can increase a little bit over time as some of your initiatives get more traction?\nKenneth Krause: Yes. I think there's an opportunity to improve upon the SG&A performance. And we've said that for some time, and we continue to see improvement in SG&A. With that said, we do have a disproportionate investment in securing customers through advertising and door-to-door and other activities. But with that said, our focus is to continue to improve upon the administrative side of the back office and without sacrificing the investments for growth. And so we're hopeful to see improvement as we go forward, just like we've seen in the last couple of years here. In the last year or so, we continue to see improvement despite the investments we're making. But we feel like we're well positioned on that front.\nJosh Chan: Okay. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. And on the Residential side, you mentioned that the onetime service slowed down a little in Q4 and maybe a little slower in Q1 as well. Is there anything to interpret from that from perhaps a macro perspective or any other reasons that would drive that to be a little slower for the upcoming quarter as well?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. Really, what we saw was a slowdown in some of the residential bed bug, onetime work and also on the wildlife side, which often involves some rat type of -- rat and rodent type of work, a slowdown there. Those are the main drivers of that, whether that's seasonal, whether it's something that's changed in the weather or change in demand. We're not completely certain of any of that. But bed bugs, for example, being down has always been something that has fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year on some of the ups and downs. And it was just more significantly down for us in recent months.\nKenneth Krause: When we look at that question, Josh, because we've looked at that as well because we deal with consumers, homeowners. And when we look at the business and we assess more of a macro level, we look across our business. We look not only in the Residential pest control that Jerry just spoke about, well we also look at the Termite Ancillary. And that Ancillary business is normally some high-ticket items. And if that continues to grow, the pace it's growing, it's indicative that the consumer is pretty healthy. With that said, we were proactive in the end of last year at tightening credit down in a number of different areas just to ensure that we don't run into any issues from a credit perspective. And so in our acceptance score, we raised the minimum level per credit, just trying to be proactive in today's market. But from a demand perspective, we're certainly not seeing any major deterioration in growth profile with our customers.\nJosh Chan: Great. Thank you both for the real good color. And good luck in 2024.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping you could give us an update on labor, namely your salespeople. Are you seeing higher employee retention right now versus normal? And I know you mentioned deploying some sales tools and wondering if you could talk about other initiatives as well.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. So the labor side of it is we have been very good at hiring onboard and training our sales teams, especially on the -- well, really on the Commercial and Residential side, we're talking specifically a little bit more about the Commercial side. But one of the things that you learn with on the Commercial side, where you typically have a longer sales cycle, it takes longer from the time so you have a lead or create a creative lead to get a deal closed, you really have to get those salespeople productive in selling and finding success early on. And that's what helps you with keeping people in the long term. The more they're successful, the more they're winning. The longer they stay and the more money they earn, they go to our presidents club events, those types of things. And I'm really proud of our -- of the sales team that we've built both on the Commercial and Residential side. It's a team of very high-performing people that we've enabled that through how we hire, how we train, how we invest in them, how we give them those tools to be successful. And that's ultimately what drives retention. That's what makes them want to stay. So we have a lot of momentum in that space that I just feel really good about as we head into 2024.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. I wanted to ask a big picture around footprint. Are you happy with the current coverage and portfolio of geographies that you're in? Or are there other geographies that you'd like to gain further density in? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would say we are pretty happy. We have very broad geographic coverage under the Orkin brand in North America. And when you look in the U.S., mainly the area that we don't have the second bite of the apple brand strategy is fully built is really probably in the Midwest where we have some opportunity where we would like to continue to add and invest in M&A. And then when you think about international, we're very happy with our Australian operations growing and healthy, and we're going to continue to build out Australia, the United Kingdom and Singapore where we currently operate, but we really haven't put a lot of upper energy behind expanding outside of those areas. We like where we are, and we're going to continue to build and focus on those countries where we've expanded internationally.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you.\nKenneth Krause: Good morning.\nStephanie Moore: I was hoping you could touch a little bit on maybe what you're seeing on the unit cost inflation side, some key areas. You give a little bit about labor, but maybe just across the board, labor, materials, equipment, the likes and kind of expectations for 2024 versus what you saw, experienced in 2023? Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: When we look across the cost structure, we look at our people costs, we look at our material supplies, we look at our fleet. Those are the 3 major drivers of cost in addition to insurance and claims, which sometimes can be less controllable, not completely controllable as much as some of the other areas. But we're pretty pleased with the leverage we saw on the organic side of our business across those 3 cost categories. We continue to benefit from lower gas prices, slightly lower gas prices, lower oil prices. That's definitely beneficial on the fleet side of our business. The interest rate environment certainly is less favorable from a leasing perspective. But we continue to focus on pricing the value of our services so that our gross margins will continue to improve and step higher. We were pleased with the 50 basis points we saw this past year on the gross margin side of our -- organic side of gross margin, and we're continuing to focus on leveraging our cost structure in a similar fashion going forward.\nJerry Gahlhoff: And Stephanie, I would add, we do have some concerns about truck prices rising. Some of these fleet vehicles or costs are going up. As Ken mentioned, there's always the wild card as fuel prices and fluctuations we have there. On the M&S side, we just completed an RFP on our insecticides and termiticides, trying to ensure our pricing is in line on that and trying to generate some savings or at least offset the -- as much as we can, some of the price increases that are being passed along to us from some of our suppliers. So those are all things that are top of mind for us that we'll keep focused on through the year.\nStephanie Moore: Great. No, that's helpful. And then, I mean, I guess just as a follow-up, I'm just trying to piece together the idea of similar price increases in 2024 versus 2023 but it sounds like the -- inflation is supposedly coming down here in 2024. So I guess what you're saying is it's probably still a little too early to tell if the inflationary side will have that material -- will step down in 2024. Is that kind of the right way to interpret that?\nJerry Gahlhoff: That's -- yes, that's what I'm hitting at. There's still -- there's some unknowns, there may be still some costs that we don't know. And you look at the inflation data that demonstrate that it's not necessarily slowing as fast as we all would probably like it to. So we're still -- we're cautiously optimistic there.\nStephanie Moore: Great. And then just lastly, on M&A and kind of M&A activity, any changes in terms of pipeline or willingness of sellers that you've seen as of late? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I don't think there's any significant change. There's still good deal flow out there. We -- there's good businesses that are out there for sale. And while -- from a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's some ebbs and flows to that kind of volume that we get to see or look at. But there's still plenty of good business out there that are potentially worth acquiring. So we've gotten off to a good start already in January. We feel good about our pipeline. We're actually a little ahead of where we were last year in that regard. But last year, keep in mind, in January, February, we announced the Fox deal in April, we were heads down working on the Fox deal. So we put a lot of stuff aside to focus on that. So now we're back to kind of business as usual and looking at normal deal flow.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you guys so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Mazzoni: Quickly, yes. So maybe quickly, just to touch on the price/cost spread. Looking at the kind of improvements in the driver safety score and that KPI, could you just help us understand how that can flow through to kind of lower insurance-related costs going forward? And what's the typical timing or delay? I mean, this is probably not going to be a kind of near-term item, but could we expect in the back half of the year? Or would it be something that has a longer variable lag? Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: It's a hard thing to predict, John, when you look at that trend line because it does take quite a while to work its way through. The last 12 months or so year-over-year, insurance and claims costs were negative for us despite not having large payouts, large claims that we settled like we did a year or so ago. But with that said, we're hopeful that it will improve. When we look at safety, it's not just about the financials either, it's about our people. And so when we think about our people-first culture, we want people to be safe. We want them to return home each and every night and that's really the focus here. It's how we make sure our drivers are safe and the communities that they continue to work and remain very safe, and they can get home each and every day. So we're focused on the people side. By doing the right thing, ultimately, the financials will improve. And that's the focus here. As we think about the future in the next several years, that we'll continue to see improvements on safety. People will be safe and we'll see the benefits of that come through our financial statement.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great color. And then maybe just the last one is around kind of a preview of the Investor Day. Anything that we could kind of look forward to, maybe around technology or capital allocation? Or should we just stay tuned? Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: Yes. I would say, stay tuned, but we're really excited to get back to New York and to spend time with our investment community, talking about our growth prospects, our strategic priorities for the future, talking about how we will continue to expect the investments and growth initiatives. We're just really excited to spend the day talking about the future of this great company.\nJohn Mazzoni: Sounds great. Looking forward to it.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you, John.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now hand the call back to management for any closing comments.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in a few months. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kenneth Krause",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect continued strong execution by the team. Let me begin with a few highlights for 2023. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of 14% for the year with double-digit growth across each of our service offerings. It was encouraging to see organic growth of 8% for the year, while acquisitions continue to be a meaningful part of our growth profile, accounting for approximately 6% of our total revenue growth. Second, we made good progress on profitability improvement in 2023. Full-year gross margins were healthy as we were positive on the price cost equation and saw improvement across several key cost categories. Adjusted operating margin finished the year at 19.7%, improving 140 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. This translated into GAAP EPS of $0.89 per share, up over 18% for the year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, up 20% for the year. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of almost 30% for the year and on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 28% for the year. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $528 million and free cash flow of $495 million, both up over 13% versus last year. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying nearly $1 billion of capital in 2023 with a focus on investing for growth, while returning cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. Turning to our fourth quarter performance. The team delivered a strong quarter with revenue up 14% to $754 million. Currencies had a negligible impact on quarterly revenue growth. We saw a good balance of growth between organic and inorganic activities as organic revenue was up over 7% with acquisitions accounting for the other 7% of growth. Jerry mentioned that we divested certain non-core businesses in the quarter, most notably our lawn care business. The purchase price for the transaction was $18 million. We received $15 million in proceeds during 2023 and recorded a pretax gain of $15 million on the sale. This business doesn't provide the growth or profitability profile of our core pest control business. Going forward, we don't anticipate any significant divestitures associated with portfolio rationalization in the foreseeable future. In the fourth quarter, Residential revenues increased approximately 18%, Commercial Pest Controls rose nearly 11%, and Termite and Ancillary was up over 13%. Organic growth was healthy across the portfolio with growth of nearly 5% in Residential, approximately 9% in Commercial, and over 11% in Termite and Ancillary. We normally see a step down in revenue as well as growth in Q4 along with Q1 due to seasonality. Comparing Q4 this year to last year, we saw an acceleration in organic growth across all service lines. Gross margin improved 40 basis points to 50.9% in the quarter. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 30 basis points, we saw 10 basis points of improvement in organic margins as leverage from people costs and fleet offset pressure from materials and supplies and higher insurance-related costs. Gross profit also steps down in Q4 and Q1, primarily due to lower volume levels associated with the seasonality of our business I previously discussed. With that said, I'm pleased with the fourth quarter performance as we saw improvement year-over-year and recorded our highest Q4 gross margin level in the last several decades. Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points in the quarter. We saw nice leverage on people costs, which offset increased advertising and selling expense associated with the growth initiatives that Jerry discussed previously. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $139 million, up 16% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $144 million, up over 20% versus the prior year on 14% total revenue growth. Quarterly EBITDA was $181 million, up 24% versus last year, and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24%, up 190 basis points versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million, up 14% and representing a 22.1% margin, flat versus last year. While we saw nice leverage with respect to both gross profit and SG&A, adjusted EBITDA margins were negatively impacted by about 40 basis points in the quarter due to lower non-operational gains on property and vehicle sales that were included in other income when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This impacted incremental EBITDA margins in the quarter as well. The effective tax rate was 25.8% for both the quarter and the full-year period. And for 2024, we're expecting an effective rate -- tax rate of approximately 26%. Quarterly GAAP net income was approximately $109 million or $0.22 per share, an increase of nearly 30% from $0.17 per share in the same period a year ago. For the fourth quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items that I mentioned earlier, totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. We also recognized the $15 million pretax benefit associated with a gain on the sale of our non-core business. Taking into account these adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $101 million or $0.21 per share, increasing over 23% from the same period a year ago. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 24% in the quarter to $153 million. We generated $142 million of free cash flow on $109 million of GAAP earnings, a 22% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 100% for the quarter. Debt remains low and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross and net level. We continued to fund our dividend in the quarter. Going back to the fourth quarter of 2022, we have increased our dividend 45% and we remain committed to funding our growing dividend as cash flow improves. As we look to 2024, we remain encouraged by the strength of our markets and the execution by our team. We are focused on delivering another year of robust growth and healthy incremental margins, further complemented by a strategic and disciplined approach to M&A. From a pricing perspective, we remain focused on effectively pricing the value of our services to remain positive on the price cost equation. And we have begun to raise prices for 2024 in the first quarter at a rate that is consistent with 2023 levels. We also continue to be active in managing our rate cards. Our focus remains on driving consistent growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and compounding cash flow that will enable a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on investing in growth initiatives in our core market. Before I turn the call back to Jerry, I wanted to announce that we will be holding an investor and analyst conference on the morning of May 17th in New York City, where we will share more about our strategic priorities and how we are positioning ourselves for continued success in the future. We're looking forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks and months. But for now, please hold the date. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Good morning. Certainly, Tim, I'll start, and then turn it over to Jerry for additional comments as well. But when we look at the business, the business, as you so well indicate has a high degree of recurring revenue. And so as a result, there is a consistent base to the revenue that we enjoy and we benefit from. The one thing that does have an impact on our business from time-to-time is what we call onetime type of service. And when we look at the quarter in the fourth quarter, we did see a decel and the deceleration in the rate of growth in those areas of our business. That's probably the largest area of impact on the revenue growth in the quarter. We were really encouraged, quite frankly with the level of growth that we continue to see from the recurring business. It was a healthy level of growth for us, despite being stacked up against last October, you may recall was more beneficial because hurricane season was pretty tough in September. And so some of that business pushed into the fourth quarter of last year. There's always puts and takes, of course, in this business with weather. But we continue to be pretty encouraged with respect to our growth, especially in the resi sector. Yes. It's interesting, Jerry, just adding on to that. When we look at the business in the fourth quarter and as well as throughout the year, what really proves the point that we're continuing to see good cross-sell, and we always talk about additional ways we access the customer. And one area is the cross-sell and the Termite and Ancillary business is really representative of that. We continue to see really robust levels of demand on the Ancillary side of our business, which is driven a lot by that cross-sell activity that the team continued to execute upon. So as we had talked about previously, Jason, we had passed along a 3% to 4% price increase in the prior year. We followed that on again this year with a similar price increase here in the first quarter, ahead of our heavier pest market season, which starts here later in the first quarter. So we're pretty -- in terms of what we're seeing on the customer side, we monitor that. We assess that, we look at churn, we look at cancellations, we look at rollbacks. We look at a number of different metrics. And we feel like the level that we're passing along is at a very healthy level and is representative of the value of our services. When we look at our growth, Jason, in the quarter at organic growth, which was north of 7%, and we think about how that fares relative to how we've discussed the business and also how we outperformed. We're pretty happy with the level of growth that we're seeing come through the business. And we also continue to have a high degree of optimism and we're encouraged about the future growth that we continue to see in this business. So we really look at how we're performing relative to our expectations, and we continue to perform at a level that we're pretty pleased with. Certainly, George. When we look at the growth rates and we look at their recurring revenue growth relative to prior quarters, the business continues to perform pretty well. It continues to hold in there. I mean Q4 always sees a step down and just generally the growth year-over-year. But it's above what we saw a year ago, and it continues to be at a healthy level. So there's nothing that's indicating that there's a significant decel in the growth rates or a different or a change in profile and the growth rates that we're seeing coming through our business. Certainly, when you step back and you look at the business, George, we look at it across a number of different priorities. We -- and when we think about our expectations going forward, we talked earlier about our pricing. We're focused certainly on getting the value of our services through strategic pricing management. And we again raised prices and we'll continue to raise prices and manage our rate cards effectively. So that's one side of the equation. And so that rate -- that growth rate associated with pricing is at this point expected to be in line with what we saw a year ago at 3% to 4%. And then secondly, when we look at growth profile across the business, we remain encouraged by our position in our market. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver a healthy level of growth going forward that's in line with what we've seen here in the last couple of years. We've all enjoyed the benefit and you've seen the benefit of our growth rate accelerating post-COVID. We continue to operate at a pretty healthy level of growth in our business from an organic perspective. And then, of course, we saw a really robust uptick in growth associated with M&A in the last year. When we look at the initiatives across the business, the cross-sell is certainly really important, going after those customers that may have one service, but trying to add additional services like mosquito and ticks and other services like that. Continuing the focusing on the Termite and Ancillary business is very important. And then last but certainly not least, is the Commercial side. Jerry spoke about the Commercial business in detail, we talked about it in the third quarter as well. We continue to place this portion of focus on the Commercial business and driving growth there. So all of those initiatives are coming together to give us optimism as we think about our growth rates going forward. Good morning. Certainly. When we look at M&A, we continue to be focused on M&A. We continue to focus on executing that disciplined strategy. We see roughly 2% carryover coming into 2024 from M&A. A large part of that, of course is here in the first quarter with Fox, we acquired Fox last April. So we still have one quarter of benefit. When we look at the pipeline, we see a healthy pipeline. We were very active to close out the year and then also to start 2024. January activity in deals that we closed are up. So we continue to chart towards that 2% plus level of growth, 2% to 3% plus level of growth associated with M&A as we go forward. But the carryover is around 2%. Certainly. When we look at the incremental margin profile, there's no reason -- I mean, we continue to see and have a confidence level in delivering 30% incremental margins. If you look at the incremental margin in the last several years, we've seen it step up. Our focus has been -- we've been laser-focused on incremental margins and driving improvements on the margin profile. And so when we think about that level, that's the range at 30%. We've seen quarters as high as 35% to 40%. So it will jump around from quarter-to-quarter. And you're going to see that. But generally, when we step back and we finished the year at 28% to 30%, we're pretty pleased. That means we're getting 70 basis points as we did of improvement in EBITDA margins. The gains on asset sales will come through. They came through in Q3 -- or I'm sorry, Q4 here. And we saw roughly $3 million lower asset sales that came through other income, about 40 basis points on the margin line and the EBITDA margin line. And that will come through from time-to-time. And we'll try to isolate that as we go forward for you. Thank you. Yes. And the second part of your question, I think, it was around cicadas and new pests. And we continue to monitor new pest activity. Cicadas are one of the many pests that we continue to monitor. Jerry, I don't know if you want to add. I'm certainly not the expert when it comes to cicadas. You're probably much better positioned to answer that? Yes. We continue to be very early on in our journey with respect to modernization, making good progress. We've added a number of new team members across our back office, we've made some significant changes. But we're pretty excited about what's to come. With that said, when we look at the SG&A performance over time, we've continued to see that improve. Going back a couple of years, it was almost 31%. It's come down under 29% here in the quarter. So we continue to leverage that and despite having investments and growth initiatives associated with the commercial business as well as other parts of our business. And so we're early on in the journey. We feel like there's some opportunities as we go forward to continue to improve the business. Thank you. Yes. I think there's an opportunity to improve upon the SG&A performance. And we've said that for some time, and we continue to see improvement in SG&A. With that said, we do have a disproportionate investment in securing customers through advertising and door-to-door and other activities. But with that said, our focus is to continue to improve upon the administrative side of the back office and without sacrificing the investments for growth. And so we're hopeful to see improvement as we go forward, just like we've seen in the last couple of years here. In the last year or so, we continue to see improvement despite the investments we're making. But we feel like we're well positioned on that front. When we look at that question, Josh, because we've looked at that as well because we deal with consumers, homeowners. And when we look at the business and we assess more of a macro level, we look across our business. We look not only in the Residential pest control that Jerry just spoke about, well we also look at the Termite Ancillary. And that Ancillary business is normally some high-ticket items. And if that continues to grow, the pace it's growing, it's indicative that the consumer is pretty healthy. With that said, we were proactive in the end of last year at tightening credit down in a number of different areas just to ensure that we don't run into any issues from a credit perspective. And so in our acceptance score, we raised the minimum level per credit, just trying to be proactive in today's market. But from a demand perspective, we're certainly not seeing any major deterioration in growth profile with our customers. Good morning. When we look across the cost structure, we look at our people costs, we look at our material supplies, we look at our fleet. Those are the 3 major drivers of cost in addition to insurance and claims, which sometimes can be less controllable, not completely controllable as much as some of the other areas. But we're pretty pleased with the leverage we saw on the organic side of our business across those 3 cost categories. We continue to benefit from lower gas prices, slightly lower gas prices, lower oil prices. That's definitely beneficial on the fleet side of our business. The interest rate environment certainly is less favorable from a leasing perspective. But we continue to focus on pricing the value of our services so that our gross margins will continue to improve and step higher. We were pleased with the 50 basis points we saw this past year on the gross margin side of our -- organic side of gross margin, and we're continuing to focus on leveraging our cost structure in a similar fashion going forward. It's a hard thing to predict, John, when you look at that trend line because it does take quite a while to work its way through. The last 12 months or so year-over-year, insurance and claims costs were negative for us despite not having large payouts, large claims that we settled like we did a year or so ago. But with that said, we're hopeful that it will improve. When we look at safety, it's not just about the financials either, it's about our people. And so when we think about our people-first culture, we want people to be safe. We want them to return home each and every night and that's really the focus here. It's how we make sure our drivers are safe and the communities that they continue to work and remain very safe, and they can get home each and every day. So we're focused on the people side. By doing the right thing, ultimately, the financials will improve. And that's the focus here. As we think about the future in the next several years, that we'll continue to see improvements on safety. People will be safe and we'll see the benefits of that come through our financial statement. Yes. I would say, stay tuned, but we're really excited to get back to New York and to spend time with our investment community, talking about our growth prospects, our strategic priorities for the future, talking about how we will continue to expect the investments and growth initiatives. We're just really excited to spend the day talking about the future of this great company. Thank you, John."

            "content": "Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was an outstanding year for Rollins as we achieved a milestone of $3.1 billion in revenue. Demand from our customers remained strong throughout the year across all major service offerings. While full-year revenue increased 14% versus last year, we grew earnings per share by over 18% and adjusted earnings per share by 20%, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and a commitment to continuous improvement in our business. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter and observed sustained strength in the pest control markets we serve. We also continue to drive share gains in our markets by leveraging a multi-brand, multichannel approach at scale to differentiate ourselves competitively. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods help us reach new customers and enhance engagement with existing customers to support organic growth. We have also strategically allocated resources to the commercial side of our business to capitalize on opportunities within key verticals. Most notably, we have grown our sales force and invested in training and tools to enable their success. Our service quality is high, and our offerings are customized, which helps new sales professionals gain confidence and become successful quickly. Additionally, we are leveraging the scale of our Orkin brand across North America to effectively serve commercial customers coast-to-coast in both the U.S. and Canada. While we're still early with respect to our efforts in this area, we see good results as demonstrated by approximately 11% commercial revenue growth for the year. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. And in 2023, we welcomed 24 new businesses into our company through acquisition. This includes the addition of Fox Pest Control, which was the second largest acquisition in our company's history. Our synergistic approach to integration has gone well with the Fox team exceeding the financial targets we outlined last April. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we divested certain non-core businesses, most notably our lawn care business, which includes insect, fertilization, and weed control for turf grafts. We recognized a pretax gain on sales of that transaction of approximately $15 million. The decision to divest this asset aligns with our strategy to focus on profitable growth in core pest control operations. Operationally, we remain committed to developing exceptional talent and investing in our teams. The hiring environment improved in 2023 as we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions as well as the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing levels help us capitalize on continued demand and deliver solid results for the year. 2023 was also an important year with respect to continuous improvement and safety was a key area of focus for us. During the year, we implemented an app that monitors driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. The app protects unsafe driving maneuvers associated with acceleration, breaking and speed, then converts data collected into a driver safety score. I'm pleased to report that by year-end, our average driver safety score for drivers that we monitor increased over 30% from the beginning of the year, but we aren't stopping there. Improving the safety culture isn't something that is done overnight. But we are proud of the progress we have made and have set ambitious goals for ourselves to encourage safe behaviors throughout our organization. We believe these efforts will improve our ability to serve customers, help mitigate potentially negative financial impacts on our business and most importantly, ensure our people return home safe every day. Our continuous improvement efforts also set our own initiatives to modernize our back office and support functions. This is a work in progress, but we took some important steps to upgrade talent and systems during the year. These efforts are aimed at further enabling our growth priorities and increasing productivity as we work to become a better, more effective provider of shared services for our brands. In closing, our performance in 2023 demonstrates the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of pest control brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement throughout the business. We remain committed to providing our customers with the best customer experience and investing meaningfully in our team to drive growth both organically, as well as through disciplined acquisitions. We're pleased with where our business stands today and the momentum we carry into 2024. And I want to thank each of our 19,000 plus associates around the world for their efforts and contribution to our success in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Good morning. And I would add, Ken, as I think about residential pest control, your -- every other month in your quarterly service frequency offerings of your recurring base, that's your bread and butter. That is the healthiest indicator of what's going on in our business as we are growing our business, increasing our volumes and are we ending the year from a positive standpoint and customer -- in net customers -- net new customers to start the year, we certainly did that. And that quarterly and EOM pest control is your bread and butter and the onetime is that gravy on top. And sometimes you don't always get that gravy and that's what's really caused the slowdown in addition to the divestiture of the lawn care, that was about another $1 million on the residential side that also impacted that number in the quarter as well, Tim. Yes. Absolutely. Our recurring quarterly every other month service definitely outpaced our organic overall number. Yes. So as we look at the digital queries we saw in the fourth quarter, the digital queries, we saw modest increases in the quarter versus the prior year. But we did -- so it did result in some healthy increases in lead starts and sales both from a digital as well as just overall in our business. We did see a lift there. It was certainly better than flat. It wasn't stellar performance, but it was an improvement year-over-year. So we believe we continue to benefit from a diversified approach that we're not overly reliant on all the digital space. And that's a key part of the formula in our organic growth. It's a good idea. You should probably get on it yourself, too. Thank you. I mean we continue to have a highly fragmented market in this industry. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't necessarily characterize any significant shifts or changes in that competitiveness, it's always been that way. And while there are some ebbs and flows in here and there, we just keep doing what we do, focusing on our business and trying to win at what we do so. George, I'll add. This is Jerry. When we think about one of the ways I just love our business model is the diversity that we get from our brand strategy. Each of our brands has various different ways to acquire customers, whether it be, say, Northwest and Home team that rely heavily on the homebuilding market or Fox doing door-to-door. And now, for example, we have Home team doing door-to-door and expanding that offering in their business by things they learn from the Fox team. These are all things that we can deploy across and due to the diversity of our brands and what each one brings to the table that we think continues to help us with this solid growth profile for the future. Thank you, George. Ashish, I'll -- this is Jerry. I'll kind of try to take the first part of that statement. I asked our marketing team what was going on in the fourth quarter from a digital spend standpoint. It was a time when we'd like to invest a little earlier in the year in some of the marketing. And it did appear anecdotally that there was a pretty significant uptick in competitive spend in the fourth quarter at a time when we were backing, winding down some of our marketing spend that there was some pretty significant investment in the market there in the fourth quarter. So we certainly saw the competitive environment pick up in that regard where there was more spend into there. Now how that equated to sales and starts to new customers or onetime work on the residential side, we don't really know. But -- so that's on your first question, that's... Yes. Well, cicadas typically are not a household pest control problem. They are a nuisance because when they come out and the volumes as they did a couple of years ago, they wreak havoc from a noise standpoint, I know -- I have a house in the mountains that you couldn't sleep at night, and it was very annoying. But they tend to just go away over time, but it probably will create some awareness about pests in general and things that bother humans, but it's not as though our pest control companies are going to be out there attempting to eradicate cicadas. So that's seemingly an impossible feat. We're really just out there waiting for them to die off and go away and start the whole process over again. So it will probably create some buzz in the marketplace, and that's always good for business. Yes. Really, what we saw was a slowdown in some of the residential bed bug, onetime work and also on the wildlife side, which often involves some rat type of -- rat and rodent type of work, a slowdown there. Those are the main drivers of that, whether that's seasonal, whether it's something that's changed in the weather or change in demand. We're not completely certain of any of that. But bed bugs, for example, being down has always been something that has fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year on some of the ups and downs. And it was just more significantly down for us in recent months. Thank you. Yes. So the labor side of it is we have been very good at hiring onboard and training our sales teams, especially on the -- well, really on the Commercial and Residential side, we're talking specifically a little bit more about the Commercial side. But one of the things that you learn with on the Commercial side, where you typically have a longer sales cycle, it takes longer from the time so you have a lead or create a creative lead to get a deal closed, you really have to get those salespeople productive in selling and finding success early on. And that's what helps you with keeping people in the long term. The more they're successful, the more they're winning. The longer they stay and the more money they earn, they go to our presidents club events, those types of things. And I'm really proud of our -- of the sales team that we've built both on the Commercial and Residential side. It's a team of very high-performing people that we've enabled that through how we hire, how we train, how we invest in them, how we give them those tools to be successful. And that's ultimately what drives retention. That's what makes them want to stay. So we have a lot of momentum in that space that I just feel really good about as we head into 2024. I would say we are pretty happy. We have very broad geographic coverage under the Orkin brand in North America. And when you look in the U.S., mainly the area that we don't have the second bite of the apple brand strategy is fully built is really probably in the Midwest where we have some opportunity where we would like to continue to add and invest in M&A. And then when you think about international, we're very happy with our Australian operations growing and healthy, and we're going to continue to build out Australia, the United Kingdom and Singapore where we currently operate, but we really haven't put a lot of upper energy behind expanding outside of those areas. We like where we are, and we're going to continue to build and focus on those countries where we've expanded internationally. Thank you. And Stephanie, I would add, we do have some concerns about truck prices rising. Some of these fleet vehicles or costs are going up. As Ken mentioned, there's always the wild card as fuel prices and fluctuations we have there. On the M&S side, we just completed an RFP on our insecticides and termiticides, trying to ensure our pricing is in line on that and trying to generate some savings or at least offset the -- as much as we can, some of the price increases that are being passed along to us from some of our suppliers. So those are all things that are top of mind for us that we'll keep focused on through the year. That's -- yes, that's what I'm hitting at. There's still -- there's some unknowns, there may be still some costs that we don't know. And you look at the inflation data that demonstrate that it's not necessarily slowing as fast as we all would probably like it to. So we're still -- we're cautiously optimistic there. I don't think there's any significant change. There's still good deal flow out there. We -- there's good businesses that are out there for sale. And while -- from a quarter-to-quarter basis, there's some ebbs and flows to that kind of volume that we get to see or look at. But there's still plenty of good business out there that are potentially worth acquiring. So we've gotten off to a good start already in January. We feel good about our pipeline. We're actually a little ahead of where we were last year in that regard. But last year, keep in mind, in January, February, we announced the Fox deal in April, we were heads down working on the Fox deal. So we put a lot of stuff aside to focus on that. So now we're back to kind of business as usual and looking at normal deal flow. Thanks, John. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in a few months. Thank you."

On the line with me today on speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of over 15% to $840 million. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of over 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines, as Residential increased approximately 20%, Commercial Pest Control rose approximately 12% and Termite was up 11% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was robust following the slower June activity that we discussed on the last quarter. We saw consistent growth in the mid-teens each month of the third quarter. We have observed continued underlying strength in the pest control markets year-to-date, particularly within North America. Additionally, our addressable markets are large fragmented and supported by a number of key secular trends including, but not limited to: one a shift from DIY to do-it-for-me; two, population migration to warmer climates; three, changing weather patterns; and four, the stickiness of hybrid work schedules leading to people spending more time at home.  As we look at our competitive position in these attractive markets, we believe we continue to benefit from several key elements of our business model. If you look back over the last 15 years or so, we've consistently grown revenues through the great recession in 2009 and on through the industrial slowdown in the mid-teens. We reliably grew mid-single digits year-in and year-out. Revenue growth accelerated pre-COVID and that has generally continued. We delivered high single-digit organic growth in each of the last 11 quarters. Let me highlight four key areas that we believe have differentiated us in the market and position us well to continue outpacing a market where secular trends should support mid single-digit growth over the next several years. First, our leading portfolio of pest control companies gives us a unique position in our markets. The combination of Orkin and our strong group of regional brands gives us multiple bites at the apple with potential customers and additional cross-sell opportunities. Second, we use a variety of methods to acquire new residential customers and add to the depth of our relationships with existing customers. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods all help us reach new customers or drive further engagement with existing customers. We also have important relationships within the homebuilding and real estate market communities through brands like HomeTeam and Northwest. We're able to capitalize on this multi-channel approach to drive residential customer growth. Third, we're investing in commercial customer acquisition targeting key strategic verticals that are the most profitable. This is paying off, with 12% growth in the quarter. And last but not least, we have a clarity of focus and have been consistently executing our strategy in our core market for a very long time. This focus and clarity ensures we don't make unnecessary changes and enables us to continue to successfully grow our share in a very attractive pest control market. These points of differentiation have positioned Rollins to achieve a healthy level of organic growth and are further complemented by strategic M&A. Looking at the recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control, the integration remains on track. The Fox teams are executing and doing well and we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Additionally, through the first nine months of this year, we closed 18 tuck-in deals in addition to Fox. The M&A pipeline remains healthy and we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position, while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and are confident in our continued ability to invest in the right strategic acquisitions, while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Our dedication to continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. In August, we took an important step towards increased efficiencies in our Atlanta Support Center to accelerate our growth goals. For the first time in about 20 years, we executed a restructuring program that was designed to support our modernization efforts and flatten our overhead structure. We plan to reinvest cost savings and initiatives that further enable our growth priorities and allow us to serve our frontline operations more efficiently. We continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. Ken will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy and we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing helped us capitalize on continued strength in demand and to achieve high levels of organic growth both in the quarter as well as year-to-date. We remain focused on safety and I'm pleased to report that we have seen our average mentor driver safety score increase over 25% since the beginning of the year. You'll recall that, this driving score is derived from an app that we have implemented to monitor driving behaviors when our vehicles are in motion. Improving the safety culture isn't something that's done overnight, but we are making strides and we're encouraged that our claims activity had less of a negative impact to our financial results versus a year ago. We are working hard in the field to increase safety awareness and training, while recognizing and rewarding those that are the safest. We believe these efforts will keep our people safe and mitigate negative financial impacts to our business. We continue to focus on creating value and returning capital to our shareholders. We're pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend by 15%, and we remain committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. Additionally in the third quarter, we completed $300 million in share repurchases. The moves we made earlier this year in modernizing our capital structure by refinancing and expanding our revolver gave us the flexibility to be opportunistic and participate in a repurchase at a very attractive price. Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Our modernization efforts continue to progress well but we're not done yet. And we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front over the coming quarters. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken we are excited about where our business stands today. We're very well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Krause: Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins' team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of over 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up over 8%. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth. Second our gross margins were healthy approaching 54% this quarter. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% was strong improving 150 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Our GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share, and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition and severance costs for the restructuring that Jerry just mentioned, adjusted earnings per share were up 27% to $0.28 per share. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $127 million and free cash flow of $121 million, both up slightly versus last year. Cash flows were impacted by the timing of certain payables the payment of payables at quarter end. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $840 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 10 basis points. Organic revenue growth was very healthy at above 8% this quarter, improving from the second quarter levels. We continue to see good demand for our services and our acquisitions, most notably Fox, continue to deliver value in the third quarter. Turning to profitability. We realized a 150 basis point improvement in gross profit margin as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. While Fox was accretive to gross margins by about 30 basis points, we saw 120 basis points improvement in organic margins in the quarter. Setting aside improvements associated with the more favorable claims experience and the contribution of Fox, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in gross margin as leverage from people costs as well as materials and supplies more than offset pressure from fleet due to lower gains on the sales of leased vehicles versus a year ago. We are pleased with our ability to leverage our cost of services provided as we continue to benefit from a more consistent pricing discipline across all of our brands this year. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the earn-out adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people costs advertising and selling costs along with insurance and claims, make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. Margins benefited year-over-year associated with improved claims experience and we saw leverage on our people costs but were negatively impacted by increased advertising and selling expenses as we invested to drive growth in our business. As Jerry mentioned, for the first time in 20 years we executed a restructuring program at our Atlanta Support Center to further support our modernization efforts. Roughly 15% of our back-office employee population was impacted and we intend to reinvest associated cost savings in both people and systems that can drive further change and increase productivity as we work to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services for our frontline operations. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for restructuring costs and for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $10 million on a pretax basis and were related primarily to Atlanta Support Center severance costs along with purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on the Fox acquisition. GAAP operating income was $177 million, up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $187 million, up approximately 29% versus the prior year on 15% total revenue growth. EBITDA was $202 million, up 19% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24.1%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, up over 22% and representing a 24.8% margin. Margins were up 150 basis points versus a year ago primarily related to the improvements in gross margin discussed previously. Fox was neutral to EBITDA margins in the quarter. Year-to-date our adjusted EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points versus a year ago with 20 basis points of that improvement coming from the Fox acquisition. Excluding this, 70 basis points, was driven across the remainder of the business. As we have consistently indicated, we like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of over 29% and excluding the restructuring costs and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition, incremental margins were almost 35%. Year-to-date we generated incremental margins on an as-reported basis of over 27%. And on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 30%. Quarterly GAAP net income was $127 million or $0.26 per share increasing from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $136 million or $0.28 per share. The effective tax rate was approximately 26% in the quarter and for the first nine months the ETR was 26% as well, up over 100 basis points compared with 2022 driven by higher foreign income taxes. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained healthy. We generated $121 million of free cash flow in the quarter versus $119 million a year ago. As previously discussed, quarterly free cash flow was impacted by the timing of certain payables primarily related to our door-to-door sales. Year-to-date free cash flow was $354 million, an increase of 11% versus last year. During the quarter, we made acquisitions totaling $21 million. We paid $64 million in dividends and we completed a share repurchase of $300 million at below $35 a share. We repurchased 8.7 million shares and used our revolver to fund this purchase. We expect this to be less than 1% dilutive to results in the first year and minimally accretive in the second year. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is below one time on a gross and net level. Our strong cash flow profile has enabled us to execute a very balanced capital allocation strategy this year. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions, repurchased $300 million of our shares and paid $192 million in dividends, a 30% increase year-to-date. Additionally we just announced another 15% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This marks over two decades of consecutive increases in annual cash dividend payments. We remain active in pursuing additional acquisitions. And looking at multiples, we remain very disciplined. Year-to-date we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions and the market remains highly fragmented and we continue to be an acquirer of choice and a very active participant in our markets. In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement across the business. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. It's good to see the strong momentum in the business. I just wanted to better understand. Can you -- you obviously talked about multiple different avenues to attract new customers. And -- but I was just wondering, if you could comment on the underlying demand environment. Have you seen any slowdown in the demand environment? And you, obviously, talked about month-to-month being consistently strong but have you seen a better focus on certain selling strategies versus another? Thanks a lot.\nJerry Gahlhoff: This is Jerry. Thanks for the question. I think some people think the entire market demand is driven by whatever someone's seeing in digital. And that's not always the case especially for our business. When you look at the digital side, it was relatively flat or maybe even slightly down on the digital side. And that's really where our strategy to have lots of approaches for how we acquire customers plays a differentiating factor for us. So while the digital segment was certainly, I think on the flattish to slightly downside, our diversified strategy is really what's paying off for us. \nKen Krause: Yeah. The only thing I would add there just two points. One, the growth across the business is quite impressive. When I look at the business in the quarter, we saw a broad-based growth not only on a quarterly basis we saw consistent growth, but broad-based growth across all of our family of brands. So that was really good to see, first. And second we exited the quarter and went into October, we continue to see a really healthy demand level. And if you might recall, a year ago we saw a lot of business from a really tough hurricane season in September get pushed into October. So to see good momentum into October also gives us a bit of optimism as we think about the future.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I think it's also important to mention that what we've seen across say the US and Canada in particular across North America is that all of our businesses are doing well and geographically not only from a brand individual brand strategy, but also from a geographic strategy they're really all doing quite well.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color. And just maybe on my follow-up I wanted to talk about the solid incremental margins that we've seen of 35%. As we think about the modernization efforts that you've worked on, how should we think about the incremental margins going forward? Is that 30% to 40% sustainable going forward? Thanks.\nKen Krause: Yeah, it's a great question Ashish and thank you for that question. What I would say is our focus is to continue to deliver a very healthy incremental margin profile. This quarter, you're correct in saying that we were 35%. We continue to see an opportunity to deliver 30% incremental margins upwards of 35% to 40%, depending on a multitude of factors but we certainly continue to have a confidence level in our ability to deliver a 30% incremental margin and continue to see EBITDA margins lift as we go into the future. It's a great business. It's an essential service. It's got pricing and we're focused on continuous improvement in our \u2013 across our business not just in our back office. So with all those points, we continue to focus on delivering a very healthy incremental margin profile.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color and congrats on the solid quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vicki Lu [ph] with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. This is Vicki on for Jason Haas. To start off I'm just curious have you seen any pushback from the 4% price increase or is it more business as usual as you see?\nKen Krause: Price increase has been \u2013 it's been a very healthy environment as what we've seen from a standpoint of price increase. You may see certain zip codes that you might see challenges in but you see other zip codes where you don't see much challenge at all. So \u2013 but overall, we see it as a very healthy environment for our essential services.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thank you. And then to follow up, do you think your customers can take another price increase on a similar scale in 2024?\nJerry Gahlhoff: We're going to \u2013 this is Jerry. We're going to evaluate that. We're here in the fourth quarter when we start really taking a look at our price increase data that results from the last nine or 10 months and say what happened? What did we learn? And create our strategies for next year. And I guess my best advice to you would be to stay tuned. We'll probably update you on that at some point in the first quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Mulrooney: Ken, Jerry, good morning.\nKen Krause: Good morning\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. So on customer acquisition, Jerry I think in your response to another question, you said the digital channel was kind of flat to down in the third quarter. My question on that is that new? Was it up in the first and second quarters of this year? Just trying to get a sense for how consumer demand in this particular channel has trended through the year?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would characterize it in the first five months of the year as somewhat up. I wouldn't say it was something that \u2013 we didn't see some sort of double-digit increases very consistently. We may have had better \u2013 some better months than others but it wasn't up at a higher \u2013 a significant higher level than prior year. There are ups and downs. And then it was really June is where we saw that almost that double-digit decrease for those three weeks in June that was sort of out of character but then it just rebounded in July. So I would say it's been dynamic and maybe the word is a little volatile over the summer a little bit but then it's now seemed to stabilize pretty consistently over the past few months in terms of flat year-over-year. So I don't know if that helps but I think that's the story of the last nine or 10 months.\nTim Mulrooney: No that's extremely helpful. There's a lot of folks out there trying to figure it out on their own and looking at your trends. And so we just hearing it from you directly is very helpful. And I fully appreciate that you have many different channels in which you acquire customers but thanks for the detail on that. The other thing I want to ask about is customer acquisition costs. Customer acquisition costs in the digital channel I know it's risen over time just like they have for everybody \u2013 I'm curious if you're seeing a narrowing I guess in the gap of customer acquisition cost between digital and door-to-door? And if so do you plan to expand the usage of that D2D channel more extensively in future periods? \nJerry Gahlhoff: So yes that is something \u2013 that is a trend that we've seen as more and more pest control companies have gotten more mature in the digital space. We have seen say the Googles of the world be able to pass along higher cost to us in terms of \u2013 especially for things like pay-per-click things along those lines. So you see that rise. And I also want to point out just because demand is flat through say Google search data or something like that or it's down 1% year-over-year or something along those lines, doesn't mean you as a company can't perform or take a larger share of that demand through \u2013 we have great marketing teams, certainly at Orkin and throughout some of our other brands as well that do some of the digital activity. And they can achieve more with the dollars spent in that market. But back to your original question, we certainly have seen over time over the last several years an increase in digital cost of customer acquisition that makes that gap between door-to-door and digital certainly narrower, and so when you look at the door-to-door model you think that can be a pretty good model if you sell it right, and especially when you consider the door-to-door is selling you density because they're working neighborhoods and you're picking up a dense more dense populations than say onesie-twosie stuff coming in from all over a metropolitan area on the digital side. So, when you factor the efficiencies that door-to-door bakes in long term even though it's a little bit more money upfront it may be it's a really strong offering from a long-term standpoint as well.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Chan: Hi, good morning Jerry and Ken. Congrats on a good quarter. I guess I wanted to ask about the customer acquisition split I guess. You mentioned digital and door-to-door mostly on this call but I guess of the ways that you acquire customers could you just give us like a rough ballpark on how what channels they typically come through in?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Got it. You're asking like what percent of customers come through which channel? \nJosh Chan: Yes exactly.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes we really don't disclose that information.\nKen Krause: But I would say that today much larger portion comes through a digital channel or more comes outside of door-to-door then comes from door-to-door.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. There's digital. There's the consumer awareness that makes the phone ring when they call our customer agents where -- they know our brands. They know our name and they call us automatically and never have to go to Google to do a search because they've seen our name phone number they see a vehicle in the neighborhood and they make the phone call, right? So, the word of mouth is still a powerful channel. So, it's really all those things that come into play to drive that but certainly digital is an important part. But we also don't like to over-rely on it as well. And we also think about technician sales. We've put a great deal of emphasis. And one of the things that you learn in this business is when you're not staffed your technicians don't sell. So, if they are -- if they're too swamped with too much work to do they're not going to go out. And when that when somebody down the road talks to them they're going to be a little less hesitant to want to sell that new job because it's just more work for them. But when you're staffed and you're staffed to a healthy levels your technicians get engaged. So, we see increases in our technician sales and their activities as a result of our better staffing levels as well. So, it's all these ways that we can acquire customers.\nJosh Chan: Right. thanks Jerry. And then I guess on the restructuring side of things is there a way to think about the payback period of the cost? And what kind of savings you expect to generate from those efforts?\nKen Krause: Yes, it's an attractive payback, Josh. Thanks for the question. When you look at the spend the $5-or-so million of spend, there's probably close to $8 million to $10 million of compensation associated with that. So, my experience has been a one-year payback is very acceptable. You can see a six-month payback and a spend associated with the restructuring here. With that said, I think if you look at the prepared commentary, we're focused on reinvesting as well. And so there is an opportunity to reinvest in new talent new talent like Lindsey. She kicked off the call today, our new Head of IR, new folks across all of finance and accounting IT, we're making significant changes in as well. And other back-office functions. So, we're looking at how do we upgrade the talent, how do we improve, how do we modernize what we do. And some of that is going to take some reinvestment of that $8 million to $10 million.\nJosh Chan: Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks Ken. Thank you both for your time.\nKen Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nAadit Shrestha: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a strong quarter again. So, what was the internal cost inflation? Is it still predominantly fleet related? And how do we how has this trended actually through the year? And just kind of related to that you talked about price/cost spread it remains positive. I think it was around 50 basis points. How has that trended versus 2Q or 1Q? And how do we think about it for remainder of the year and into 2024?\nKen Krause: So, it's Ken. I think I'll take that question. Our focus is to continue to have a positive positively manage the price/cost equation. If you look at the input costs in our business, a large percentage on a cost of services provided are people costs materials and fleet. For the most part, we've done a really good job at leveraging and improving the efficiency over those costs throughout 2023. If I go back to Q2, for example, we saw improvements in margin some of that was related to Fox. We also had headwinds if you remember from the casualty reserve. But when you separate those two, in the second quarter, we saw improved margin similar to what we saw this quarter. What we saw this quarter was outsized improvement associated with the casualty claims and insurance costs. If you go back to last year in the third quarter we were very transparent in talking about a very unfavorable headwind associated with insurance and claims. So, we were able to see improvement from what we saw last year. But our focus is to continue to be positive on the price/cost equation. Really the only headwind we saw in the quarter within our organic cost was in fleet which specifically was related to lower gains on the sale of leased vehicles. We actually talked about that in Q2 and highlighted that we would be seeing some of that here in Q3 we did see it but we were able to fully offset that and see improvements. And so that's the focus continued improvement in margins as we go forward.\nAadit Shrestha : All right. Thank you so much. And just as a follow-up I think free cash flow conversion and you pointed out there was sort of a payment -- a big payment make a you brought it down to 94% conversion. I think year-to-date you're tracking around 110% historically it averages around 120%. So do you expect 4Q sort of picks up and you actually get back to that 120% conversion for the year? And how do we think about it long term like beyond 2023 and maybe into 2024 how much more can it improve?\nKen Krause : Yes. It's a business that's very capital light. And so when you look at the cash flow profile it's hard to find a business this investing 7% to 8% and working capital has very little CapEx and enjoys the benefits of that and has been compounding cash flow at 10% to 15%. So our focus is just that how do we continue to compound cash flow in that teen range? How do we continue to convert net income and earnings at above 100% of net income. The third quarter had an impact. We saw payables come down considerably. We paid some payables as we closed out the third quarter. And our focus is to improve that as we go into Q4 and beyond. And so that continues to be our focus. We're continuing to focus on driving high levels of cash flow performance and compounding in the ranges I previously discussed.\nAadit Shrestha : Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nHarold Antor : Hello. This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. So I guess a quick question. How did weather trend in the quarter and how the [indiscernible]. And then also in 2021 MAU increase the hiring of sales professionals. So are those individuals are full productivity? And how do that impact on organic growth in the quarter? Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff : So on the -- this is Jerry, Harold. On the weather side, we had a pretty good weather quarter. Last year as Ken mentioned we had a hurricane that came through at the end of September it affected south in particular Southwest Florida. So we didn't have that type of event. So I would generally categorize it as favorable. And then as it relates to hiring of salespeople we've been very effective. And when you look at our commercial growth a lot of the investments we've made both in commercial and to some degree certainly the residential side and our termite and ancillary is the result of the effectiveness and the efficiencies that we're getting from a sales productivity standpoint of those sales the sales teams that we've added. And you look at our commercial growth looking back over the third quarter of 2022 we've added over 60 more commercial account managers into the Orkin brand alone over the past year that's really helping us that's an investment we make in the business. It's helping us drive that growth. We see a great opportunity in the commercial space. And those are the investments that we've been making over the last 12 months.\nHarold Antor : Thank you. And then just on M&A. Given where interest rates are in a certain markets, are you seeing more willing sellers how much TV is in the market? And then I guess for your acquisition strategy are you acquiring more traditional companies or more companies similar to Fox Pest Control that are door-to-door like?\nJerry Gahlhoff : We're seeing everything still in the market. Businesses are still owners are still interested in selling their businesses and the pipeline flow remains good and we're open to looking at all types of businesses that fit our model that help us continue the growth pattern that we strive to achieve help us that are accretive to our margins that are going to help us grow in a healthy positive way. So that side of it still seems very positive. What would you add to that, Ken?\nKen Krause : Yes. The only thing I would add is pricing which everybody is always focused on what are we paying for acquisitions. Two points I want to raise with respect to that. One is we don't compete on price. Our focus is to be the acquirer of choice. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When people are ready to sell their business and they're focused on brand preservation and their people they sell to our business. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When we look at the business this year we've invested $350 million in acquisitions. I would say that the multiples that we've paid for that $350 million investment is probably below the overall long-term average from a multiples perspective. So we feel good about what we're spending how we're competing and the success that we're driving through acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Mazzoni: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just to double click quickly on the commercial side. Could you maybe just talk more about the target vertical strategy as well as anything on technology that really is accelerating the kind of organic growth profile? And maybe also just \u2013 again, the 60 kind of added reps have been helpful. But just to talk about the kind of sustainability of that growth going forward? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: So, on the commercial side with targeted verticals, we've talked about this over the last few years especially as we are kind of coming out of the tail end of COVID and the investments that we've made there. We know that, our research on our customer database shows there are certain much more highly desirable verticals that we like to sell into and service into and things like hospitality or health care, hospitals, logistics, warehouses, distribution centers not that we don't want everything commercial but we have really targeted our focus on certain verticals. And when we bring on new say commercial account managers at Orkin, we're really getting them focused and targeted on working that type of material and going after those types of customers from a B2B standpoint. So it's really -- I've also discussed some of our tools like Marketo that help us from a -- on a B2B standpoint that have helped us get our outside sales people on the commercial side warmer leads and make them more productive and make them more productive quicker. That's a relationship sell. It takes some time. So we've been very deliberate about that since we started this program, probably midway through COVID seeing this as an opportunity coming once we are on the backside of COVID that would be a great opportunity for us to capitalize on. And we're again a long-term view and a long-term approach to our business and that's -- you're seeing the results and the payoff of that now. So -- and then on the technology side, certainly our marketing teams in particular when we talk about accelerating organic growth there are technologies. There's campaigns that we run where we're using technology where we're using some automation. The marketing teams are certainly innovative looking at strategies along those lines. I don't like to get into specifics, but I can assure you that they are very creative and very helpful to our sales teams in terms of creating that organic demand.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great color. Thank you. And then maybe just to quickly touch on competition. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape? And perhaps has there been any pullback in either smaller regional players or large national players?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Competitively, it's -- I mean, it's still a healthy competitive market highly fragmented and lots of players out there. So no -- we haven't seen any significant change from a competitive standpoint. That's probably noteworthy or remarkable still competitive out there.\nJohn Mazzoni: Thank you. Perfect. Thanks, again. Congratulations on the strong results.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question.\nOliver Davies: Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions for me. You mentioned on the Q2 call that organic growth is running at about 10% in July, which sort of implies that the rest of the quarter is about 7.5% so can you just talk through the sequential movement you sort of witnessed through the months and into quarter end? And then just another one on gross before margin. Are you able to give a split of organic growth between kind of new customers and cross-selling into the existing customer base?\nKen Krause: So, on the second point with respect to the margin profile of customers, we unfortunately do not track that and have that -- enjoy that level of detail in the business. But what I can tell you is, cross-sell is certainly always a big part of our strategy. When you look at the strategy, it's important to sell multiple services to one customer for a multitude of reasons. And so, it's certainly continuing to be a focus for us. And we're continuing to see good momentum in that part of our business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. When you look sequentially between July, August, September from a growth rate, you're right, July was a pretty big month, where we saw higher levels of organic. But then as we move through the quarter, it remained strong too. It was more in line with our historical averages. It was strong organic growth to close out the quarter as well.\nKen Krause: Yes. The only thing that you would add on that is -- and I don't want to start to split hairs, but when you look at Q2, we talked at the end of Q2 about a weak June. And so, it's not out of the question to think or out of the realm of reason to think that some of that business in Q2 may have pulled into Q3 in July and push that number up a bit. And so -- but there's -- I don't -- looking at Jerry, there's nothing other than that that was really out of the ordinary with respect to growth. It was healthy throughout.\nOllie Davies: Thanks. Sorry, I mean just can you give a split of organic growth between new customers and cross-selling.\nKen Krause: No. We don't -- I mean there's -- we don't -- unfortunately, we don't track that level of detail to a point where I could provide that to you right now. But I can tell you that the growth is healthy. I mean the growth is healthy across both of those areas. It's been healthy for us.\nOllie Davies: Okay. Thanks. And then just on adjusted EBITDA last year. I think it was negatively impacted by 140 basis points on the casualty reserve increase. So I guess if you add that back to last year's margin, you sort of get 24.7% versus the 24.8% delivered this quarter. So can you just talk about the moving parts? And is that still a pretty big drag on margin?\nKen Krause: Yes. The big point you're missing with that is the fact that the insurance markets have been really challenging. And so, claims are one thing, but insurance is continuing to tie on us. And so when you look at last year, you did have that negative impact on the claims that came through. But unfortunately -- and those have come down this year in Q3, but the insurance costs have not come down. And so, you're seeing really good improvement in the underlying business. It's not 150 basis points and that's why we were transparent in saying that in the quarter, when you set the improvement on the casualty reserve side, you set the Fox improvement aside, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in the underlying margins in the quarter alone. So -- but we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to improve margins as we go forward.\nOllie Davies: Okay. Thanks, very much.\nKen Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of over 15% to $840 million. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of over 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines, as Residential increased approximately 20%, Commercial Pest Control rose approximately 12% and Termite was up 11% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was robust following the slower June activity that we discussed on the last quarter. We saw consistent growth in the mid-teens each month of the third quarter. We have observed continued underlying strength in the pest control markets year-to-date, particularly within North America. Additionally, our addressable markets are large fragmented and supported by a number of key secular trends including, but not limited to: one a shift from DIY to do-it-for-me; two, population migration to warmer climates; three, changing weather patterns; and four, the stickiness of hybrid work schedules leading to people spending more time at home.  As we look at our competitive position in these attractive markets, we believe we continue to benefit from several key elements of our business model. If you look back over the last 15 years or so, we've consistently grown revenues through the great recession in 2009 and on through the industrial slowdown in the mid-teens. We reliably grew mid-single digits year-in and year-out. Revenue growth accelerated pre-COVID and that has generally continued. We delivered high single-digit organic growth in each of the last 11 quarters. Let me highlight four key areas that we believe have differentiated us in the market and position us well to continue outpacing a market where secular trends should support mid single-digit growth over the next several years. First, our leading portfolio of pest control companies gives us a unique position in our markets. The combination of Orkin and our strong group of regional brands gives us multiple bites at the apple with potential customers and additional cross-sell opportunities. Second, we use a variety of methods to acquire new residential customers and add to the depth of our relationships with existing customers. Digital marketing, cross-selling, service bundling and door-to-door sales methods all help us reach new customers or drive further engagement with existing customers. We also have important relationships within the homebuilding and real estate market communities through brands like HomeTeam and Northwest. We're able to capitalize on this multi-channel approach to drive residential customer growth. Third, we're investing in commercial customer acquisition targeting key strategic verticals that are the most profitable. This is paying off, with 12% growth in the quarter. And last but not least, we have a clarity of focus and have been consistently executing our strategy in our core market for a very long time. This focus and clarity ensures we don't make unnecessary changes and enables us to continue to successfully grow our share in a very attractive pest control market. These points of differentiation have positioned Rollins to achieve a healthy level of organic growth and are further complemented by strategic M&A. Looking at the recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control, the integration remains on track. The Fox teams are executing and doing well and we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Additionally, through the first nine months of this year, we closed 18 tuck-in deals in addition to Fox. The M&A pipeline remains healthy and we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position, while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and are confident in our continued ability to invest in the right strategic acquisitions, while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Our dedication to continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. In August, we took an important step towards increased efficiencies in our Atlanta Support Center to accelerate our growth goals. For the first time in about 20 years, we executed a restructuring program that was designed to support our modernization efforts and flatten our overhead structure. We plan to reinvest cost savings and initiatives that further enable our growth priorities and allow us to serve our frontline operations more efficiently. We continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. Ken will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy and we put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. Effective sales and service staffing helped us capitalize on continued strength in demand and to achieve high levels of organic growth both in the quarter as well as year-to-date. We remain focused on safety and I'm pleased to report that we have seen our average mentor driver safety score increase over 25% since the beginning of the year. You'll recall that, this driving score is derived from an app that we have implemented to monitor driving behaviors when our vehicles are in motion. Improving the safety culture isn't something that's done overnight, but we are making strides and we're encouraged that our claims activity had less of a negative impact to our financial results versus a year ago. We are working hard in the field to increase safety awareness and training, while recognizing and rewarding those that are the safest. We believe these efforts will keep our people safe and mitigate negative financial impacts to our business. We continue to focus on creating value and returning capital to our shareholders. We're pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend by 15%, and we remain committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. Additionally in the third quarter, we completed $300 million in share repurchases. The moves we made earlier this year in modernizing our capital structure by refinancing and expanding our revolver gave us the flexibility to be opportunistic and participate in a repurchase at a very attractive price. Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Our modernization efforts continue to progress well but we're not done yet. And we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front over the coming quarters. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken we are excited about where our business stands today. We're very well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. This is Jerry. Thanks for the question. I think some people think the entire market demand is driven by whatever someone's seeing in digital. And that's not always the case especially for our business. When you look at the digital side, it was relatively flat or maybe even slightly down on the digital side. And that's really where our strategy to have lots of approaches for how we acquire customers plays a differentiating factor for us. So while the digital segment was certainly, I think on the flattish to slightly downside, our diversified strategy is really what's paying off for us. I think it's also important to mention that what we've seen across say the US and Canada in particular across North America is that all of our businesses are doing well and geographically not only from a brand individual brand strategy, but also from a geographic strategy they're really all doing quite well. Thank you. We're going to \u2013 this is Jerry. We're going to evaluate that. We're here in the fourth quarter when we start really taking a look at our price increase data that results from the last nine or 10 months and say what happened? What did we learn? And create our strategies for next year. And I guess my best advice to you would be to stay tuned. We'll probably update you on that at some point in the first quarter. Good morning, Tim. I would characterize it in the first five months of the year as somewhat up. I wouldn't say it was something that \u2013 we didn't see some sort of double-digit increases very consistently. We may have had better \u2013 some better months than others but it wasn't up at a higher \u2013 a significant higher level than prior year. There are ups and downs. And then it was really June is where we saw that almost that double-digit decrease for those three weeks in June that was sort of out of character but then it just rebounded in July. So I would say it's been dynamic and maybe the word is a little volatile over the summer a little bit but then it's now seemed to stabilize pretty consistently over the past few months in terms of flat year-over-year. So I don't know if that helps but I think that's the story of the last nine or 10 months. So yes that is something \u2013 that is a trend that we've seen as more and more pest control companies have gotten more mature in the digital space. We have seen say the Googles of the world be able to pass along higher cost to us in terms of \u2013 especially for things like pay-per-click things along those lines. So you see that rise. And I also want to point out just because demand is flat through say Google search data or something like that or it's down 1% year-over-year or something along those lines, doesn't mean you as a company can't perform or take a larger share of that demand through \u2013 we have great marketing teams, certainly at Orkin and throughout some of our other brands as well that do some of the digital activity. And they can achieve more with the dollars spent in that market. But back to your original question, we certainly have seen over time over the last several years an increase in digital cost of customer acquisition that makes that gap between door-to-door and digital certainly narrower, and so when you look at the door-to-door model you think that can be a pretty good model if you sell it right, and especially when you consider the door-to-door is selling you density because they're working neighborhoods and you're picking up a dense more dense populations than say onesie-twosie stuff coming in from all over a metropolitan area on the digital side. So, when you factor the efficiencies that door-to-door bakes in long term even though it's a little bit more money upfront it may be it's a really strong offering from a long-term standpoint as well. You're welcome. Got it. You're asking like what percent of customers come through which channel? Yes we really don't disclose that information. Yes. There's digital. There's the consumer awareness that makes the phone ring when they call our customer agents where -- they know our brands. They know our name and they call us automatically and never have to go to Google to do a search because they've seen our name phone number they see a vehicle in the neighborhood and they make the phone call, right? So, the word of mouth is still a powerful channel. So, it's really all those things that come into play to drive that but certainly digital is an important part. But we also don't like to over-rely on it as well. And we also think about technician sales. We've put a great deal of emphasis. And one of the things that you learn in this business is when you're not staffed your technicians don't sell. So, if they are -- if they're too swamped with too much work to do they're not going to go out. And when that when somebody down the road talks to them they're going to be a little less hesitant to want to sell that new job because it's just more work for them. But when you're staffed and you're staffed to a healthy levels your technicians get engaged. So, we see increases in our technician sales and their activities as a result of our better staffing levels as well. So, it's all these ways that we can acquire customers. So on the -- this is Jerry, Harold. On the weather side, we had a pretty good weather quarter. Last year as Ken mentioned we had a hurricane that came through at the end of September it affected south in particular Southwest Florida. So we didn't have that type of event. So I would generally categorize it as favorable. And then as it relates to hiring of salespeople we've been very effective. And when you look at our commercial growth a lot of the investments we've made both in commercial and to some degree certainly the residential side and our termite and ancillary is the result of the effectiveness and the efficiencies that we're getting from a sales productivity standpoint of those sales the sales teams that we've added. And you look at our commercial growth looking back over the third quarter of 2022 we've added over 60 more commercial account managers into the Orkin brand alone over the past year that's really helping us that's an investment we make in the business. It's helping us drive that growth. We see a great opportunity in the commercial space. And those are the investments that we've been making over the last 12 months. We're seeing everything still in the market. Businesses are still owners are still interested in selling their businesses and the pipeline flow remains good and we're open to looking at all types of businesses that fit our model that help us continue the growth pattern that we strive to achieve help us that are accretive to our margins that are going to help us grow in a healthy positive way. So that side of it still seems very positive. What would you add to that, Ken? So, on the commercial side with targeted verticals, we've talked about this over the last few years especially as we are kind of coming out of the tail end of COVID and the investments that we've made there. We know that, our research on our customer database shows there are certain much more highly desirable verticals that we like to sell into and service into and things like hospitality or health care, hospitals, logistics, warehouses, distribution centers not that we don't want everything commercial but we have really targeted our focus on certain verticals. And when we bring on new say commercial account managers at Orkin, we're really getting them focused and targeted on working that type of material and going after those types of customers from a B2B standpoint. So it's really -- I've also discussed some of our tools like Marketo that help us from a -- on a B2B standpoint that have helped us get our outside sales people on the commercial side warmer leads and make them more productive and make them more productive quicker. That's a relationship sell. It takes some time. So we've been very deliberate about that since we started this program, probably midway through COVID seeing this as an opportunity coming once we are on the backside of COVID that would be a great opportunity for us to capitalize on. And we're again a long-term view and a long-term approach to our business and that's -- you're seeing the results and the payoff of that now. So -- and then on the technology side, certainly our marketing teams in particular when we talk about accelerating organic growth there are technologies. There's campaigns that we run where we're using technology where we're using some automation. The marketing teams are certainly innovative looking at strategies along those lines. I don't like to get into specifics, but I can assure you that they are very creative and very helpful to our sales teams in terms of creating that organic demand. Competitively, it's -- I mean, it's still a healthy competitive market highly fragmented and lots of players out there. So no -- we haven't seen any significant change from a competitive standpoint. That's probably noteworthy or remarkable still competitive out there. Thank you. Yes. When you look sequentially between July, August, September from a growth rate, you're right, July was a pretty big month, where we saw higher levels of organic. But then as we move through the quarter, it remained strong too. It was more in line with our historical averages. It was strong organic growth to close out the quarter as well. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. Thanks again."

            "name": "Ken Krause",
            "content": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Rollins third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today Thursday October 26, 2023. Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter call. This is Ken Krause. Before we begin, I'd like to take just a moment to formally introduce Lyndsey Burton. Lyndsey is our new VP of Investor Relations joining us most recently from the Home Depot. She brings a very strong background in Investor Relations and we're excited to have her join our team at Rollins. I look forward to introducing her to many of you in Q4 as we attend several investor conferences. Welcome Lindsey. Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins' team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered robust revenue growth of over 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up over 8%. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth. Second our gross margins were healthy approaching 54% this quarter. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% was strong improving 150 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Our GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share, and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition and severance costs for the restructuring that Jerry just mentioned, adjusted earnings per share were up 27% to $0.28 per share. And last but not least, we delivered operating cash flow of $127 million and free cash flow of $121 million, both up slightly versus last year. Cash flows were impacted by the timing of certain payables the payment of payables at quarter end. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $840 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 10 basis points. Organic revenue growth was very healthy at above 8% this quarter, improving from the second quarter levels. We continue to see good demand for our services and our acquisitions, most notably Fox, continue to deliver value in the third quarter. Turning to profitability. We realized a 150 basis point improvement in gross profit margin as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. While Fox was accretive to gross margins by about 30 basis points, we saw 120 basis points improvement in organic margins in the quarter. Setting aside improvements associated with the more favorable claims experience and the contribution of Fox, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in gross margin as leverage from people costs as well as materials and supplies more than offset pressure from fleet due to lower gains on the sales of leased vehicles versus a year ago. We are pleased with our ability to leverage our cost of services provided as we continue to benefit from a more consistent pricing discipline across all of our brands this year. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the earn-out adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people costs advertising and selling costs along with insurance and claims, make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. Margins benefited year-over-year associated with improved claims experience and we saw leverage on our people costs but were negatively impacted by increased advertising and selling expenses as we invested to drive growth in our business. As Jerry mentioned, for the first time in 20 years we executed a restructuring program at our Atlanta Support Center to further support our modernization efforts. Roughly 15% of our back-office employee population was impacted and we intend to reinvest associated cost savings in both people and systems that can drive further change and increase productivity as we work to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services for our frontline operations. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for restructuring costs and for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $10 million on a pretax basis and were related primarily to Atlanta Support Center severance costs along with purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on the Fox acquisition. GAAP operating income was $177 million, up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $187 million, up approximately 29% versus the prior year on 15% total revenue growth. EBITDA was $202 million, up 19% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 24.1%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, up over 22% and representing a 24.8% margin. Margins were up 150 basis points versus a year ago primarily related to the improvements in gross margin discussed previously. Fox was neutral to EBITDA margins in the quarter. Year-to-date our adjusted EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points versus a year ago with 20 basis points of that improvement coming from the Fox acquisition. Excluding this, 70 basis points, was driven across the remainder of the business. As we have consistently indicated, we like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of over 29% and excluding the restructuring costs and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition, incremental margins were almost 35%. Year-to-date we generated incremental margins on an as-reported basis of over 27%. And on an adjusted basis, incremental margins were almost 30%. Quarterly GAAP net income was $127 million or $0.26 per share increasing from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $136 million or $0.28 per share. The effective tax rate was approximately 26% in the quarter and for the first nine months the ETR was 26% as well, up over 100 basis points compared with 2022 driven by higher foreign income taxes. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained healthy. We generated $121 million of free cash flow in the quarter versus $119 million a year ago. As previously discussed, quarterly free cash flow was impacted by the timing of certain payables primarily related to our door-to-door sales. Year-to-date free cash flow was $354 million, an increase of 11% versus last year. During the quarter, we made acquisitions totaling $21 million. We paid $64 million in dividends and we completed a share repurchase of $300 million at below $35 a share. We repurchased 8.7 million shares and used our revolver to fund this purchase. We expect this to be less than 1% dilutive to results in the first year and minimally accretive in the second year. Debt remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is below one time on a gross and net level. Our strong cash flow profile has enabled us to execute a very balanced capital allocation strategy this year. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions, repurchased $300 million of our shares and paid $192 million in dividends, a 30% increase year-to-date. Additionally we just announced another 15% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This marks over two decades of consecutive increases in annual cash dividend payments. We remain active in pursuing additional acquisitions. And looking at multiples, we remain very disciplined. Year-to-date we have invested approximately $350 million in acquisitions and the market remains highly fragmented and we continue to be an acquirer of choice and a very active participant in our markets. In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. Our family of brands are driving profitable growth and we are focused on continuous improvement across the business. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Yeah. The only thing I would add there just two points. One, the growth across the business is quite impressive. When I look at the business in the quarter, we saw a broad-based growth not only on a quarterly basis we saw consistent growth, but broad-based growth across all of our family of brands. So that was really good to see, first. And second we exited the quarter and went into October, we continue to see a really healthy demand level. And if you might recall, a year ago we saw a lot of business from a really tough hurricane season in September get pushed into October. So to see good momentum into October also gives us a bit of optimism as we think about the future. Yeah, it's a great question Ashish and thank you for that question. What I would say is our focus is to continue to deliver a very healthy incremental margin profile. This quarter, you're correct in saying that we were 35%. We continue to see an opportunity to deliver 30% incremental margins upwards of 35% to 40%, depending on a multitude of factors but we certainly continue to have a confidence level in our ability to deliver a 30% incremental margin and continue to see EBITDA margins lift as we go into the future. It's a great business. It's an essential service. It's got pricing and we're focused on continuous improvement in our \u2013 across our business not just in our back office. So with all those points, we continue to focus on delivering a very healthy incremental margin profile. Price increase has been \u2013 it's been a very healthy environment as what we've seen from a standpoint of price increase. You may see certain zip codes that you might see challenges in but you see other zip codes where you don't see much challenge at all. So \u2013 but overall, we see it as a very healthy environment for our essential services. Good morning But I would say that today much larger portion comes through a digital channel or more comes outside of door-to-door then comes from door-to-door. Yes, it's an attractive payback, Josh. Thanks for the question. When you look at the spend the $5-or-so million of spend, there's probably close to $8 million to $10 million of compensation associated with that. So, my experience has been a one-year payback is very acceptable. You can see a six-month payback and a spend associated with the restructuring here. With that said, I think if you look at the prepared commentary, we're focused on reinvesting as well. And so there is an opportunity to reinvest in new talent new talent like Lindsey. She kicked off the call today, our new Head of IR, new folks across all of finance and accounting IT, we're making significant changes in as well. And other back-office functions. So, we're looking at how do we upgrade the talent, how do we improve, how do we modernize what we do. And some of that is going to take some reinvestment of that $8 million to $10 million. Thank you. So, it's Ken. I think I'll take that question. Our focus is to continue to have a positive positively manage the price/cost equation. If you look at the input costs in our business, a large percentage on a cost of services provided are people costs materials and fleet. For the most part, we've done a really good job at leveraging and improving the efficiency over those costs throughout 2023. If I go back to Q2, for example, we saw improvements in margin some of that was related to Fox. We also had headwinds if you remember from the casualty reserve. But when you separate those two, in the second quarter, we saw improved margin similar to what we saw this quarter. What we saw this quarter was outsized improvement associated with the casualty claims and insurance costs. If you go back to last year in the third quarter we were very transparent in talking about a very unfavorable headwind associated with insurance and claims. So, we were able to see improvement from what we saw last year. But our focus is to continue to be positive on the price/cost equation. Really the only headwind we saw in the quarter within our organic cost was in fleet which specifically was related to lower gains on the sale of leased vehicles. We actually talked about that in Q2 and highlighted that we would be seeing some of that here in Q3 we did see it but we were able to fully offset that and see improvements. And so that's the focus continued improvement in margins as we go forward. Yes. It's a business that's very capital light. And so when you look at the cash flow profile it's hard to find a business this investing 7% to 8% and working capital has very little CapEx and enjoys the benefits of that and has been compounding cash flow at 10% to 15%. So our focus is just that how do we continue to compound cash flow in that teen range? How do we continue to convert net income and earnings at above 100% of net income. The third quarter had an impact. We saw payables come down considerably. We paid some payables as we closed out the third quarter. And our focus is to improve that as we go into Q4 and beyond. And so that continues to be our focus. We're continuing to focus on driving high levels of cash flow performance and compounding in the ranges I previously discussed. Yes. The only thing I would add is pricing which everybody is always focused on what are we paying for acquisitions. Two points I want to raise with respect to that. One is we don't compete on price. Our focus is to be the acquirer of choice. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When people are ready to sell their business and they're focused on brand preservation and their people they sell to our business. And we've been very successful being the acquirer of choice for a very long period of time. When we look at the business this year we've invested $350 million in acquisitions. I would say that the multiples that we've paid for that $350 million investment is probably below the overall long-term average from a multiples perspective. So we feel good about what we're spending how we're competing and the success that we're driving through acquisition. So, on the second point with respect to the margin profile of customers, we unfortunately do not track that and have that -- enjoy that level of detail in the business. But what I can tell you is, cross-sell is certainly always a big part of our strategy. When you look at the strategy, it's important to sell multiple services to one customer for a multitude of reasons. And so, it's certainly continuing to be a focus for us. And we're continuing to see good momentum in that part of our business. Yes. The only thing that you would add on that is -- and I don't want to start to split hairs, but when you look at Q2, we talked at the end of Q2 about a weak June. And so, it's not out of the question to think or out of the realm of reason to think that some of that business in Q2 may have pulled into Q3 in July and push that number up a bit. And so -- but there's -- I don't -- looking at Jerry, there's nothing other than that that was really out of the ordinary with respect to growth. It was healthy throughout. No. We don't -- I mean there's -- we don't -- unfortunately, we don't track that level of detail to a point where I could provide that to you right now. But I can tell you that the growth is healthy. I mean the growth is healthy across both of those areas. It's been healthy for us. Yes. The big point you're missing with that is the fact that the insurance markets have been really challenging. And so, claims are one thing, but insurance is continuing to tie on us. And so when you look at last year, you did have that negative impact on the claims that came through. But unfortunately -- and those have come down this year in Q3, but the insurance costs have not come down. And so, you're seeing really good improvement in the underlying business. It's not 150 basis points and that's why we were transparent in saying that in the quarter, when you set the improvement on the casualty reserve side, you set the Fox improvement aside, we saw 50 basis points of improvement in the underlying margins in the quarter alone. So -- but we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to improve margins as we go forward. Thank you."

Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. John, would you like to begin?\nJohn Wilson : Yes. Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us today for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. We posted very strong revenue and earnings growth for both our second quarter and first 6 months of 2023. We continued to deliver solid performance across most -- all of our brands and achieved healthy levels of customer growth. Before I turn the call over to Jerry, I want to comment briefly on the results of our recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control. We closed on the Fox acquisition in April, just prior to the ramp-up of their selling season, and they have performed exceptionally well as they achieved solid growth in the first quarter of our ownership. In addition, we have been pleased with their earnings contribution as they achieved over $2 million of GAAP earnings in the first quarter of ownership. This is inclusive of a $1 million charge associated with our earn-out of the deal. Our transition with Fox has gone quite well, and we're excited to have their great team and the Fox brand as part of Rollins. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of approximately 15% to $821 million. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of approximately 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines. Commercial pest control rose approximately 11%, residential increased over 18%, and termite was up approximately 14% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was healthy, although a little uneven due to pest seasonality. On a month-to-month basis, organic growth was very robust at 10% in May before slowing a bit in June. We're back on a good trajectory now in July, in line with what we saw in May. Importantly, our frontline team member staffing levels are better than we've seen in several years, and that is providing us with an opportunity to capitalize on demand for our services. I'm also quite pleased with the progress we're making this far with the Fox Pest Control acquisition, the second largest acquisition in the history of our company. Taking a closer look, the integration of Fox has gone smoothly over the past few months. The Fox teams are executing and doing very well. The transaction was accretive to our second quarter earnings. This continues to be an exciting, highly complementary addition and we believe the revenue growth achieved this quarter is reflective of the team's focus on execution. The team at Fox was not distracted by the shift in ownership to Rollins and was focused on their customers and growing their business. Making for a smooth transition is a key tenet of our acquisition integration strategy, and our collective teams were diligent about not disrupting these efforts of our frontline team members post close. I'd like to express my thanks to the Fox team and all our teammates that have worked hard to make this happen, and we're very excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Next, we continue to have an enhanced capital structure and a robust acquisition pipeline as we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past, Acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and feel very good about our continued ability to invest in strategic acquisitions while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Another important part of our culture is our dedication to continuous improvement. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. As a result, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. We are currently evaluating several streamlining efforts. Kim will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. In addition to the unrelenting focus on productivity and improving our margin profile, we're also more strongly focused on safety. Our experience was disappointing in this area in Q2 as we continue to see higher settlements associated primarily with auto accidents. This was a $0.01 per share drag on earnings this quarter versus a year ago. We have ramped up efforts to significantly reduce automobile accidents moving forward. Our drivers now utilize an app that begins monitoring driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. This app detects unsafe driving maneuvers, such as acceleration, braking, distractions and speed and then converts these data into an industry-accepted FICO driving score from 100 to 850, with 850 being the best. The data indicate that drivers with scores below 710 are 30% more likely to have a collision than those with higher scores. We're working hard in the field to increase driver safety awareness and get these scores up by coaching and training those with lower scores while recognizing and rewarding those that score the highest. We believe these efforts will help us keep people safe and mitigate negative potential financial impact to our business. On the investment side, we proactively increased customer acquisition-related efforts during the second quarter and strategically invested more heavily on advertising spend when compared with the same quarter a year ago and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. While these costs were a $0.01 drag on second quarter earnings, we saw meaningful opportunities to go after and acquire new customers during the start of the busier spring and summer seasons. Given that approximately 80% of our business is recurring, I want to emphasize that the opportunity for us to attract potential new customers is very important and it's a strategic investment over the long term. To date, we're extremely pleased with our targeted marketing and advertising efforts, which we believe is reflected in our strong organic growth performance for the quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue into the third quarter of 2023. Next, we continue to focus on modernizing our business, our capital structure and our organization. As you may recall, in February, we enhanced our capital structure by refinancing our revolver, increasing it from $175 million in 2 banks up to $1 billion in 8 banks, providing us with investment-grade flexibility. More recently, our approximately $1.5 billion universal shelf facility was declared effective by the SEC. This facility provides additional financial capital and flexibility to the company, and Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy, and we've put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both the support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. As we look ahead to the improvement opportunity in front of us, we're focused on upgrading and realigning key areas in our home office support functions. You've heard us talk about opportunities in this area, and we are evaluating several initiatives as we start the second half of 2023. We believe that driving this type of change will provide opportunities to accelerate our growth goals and enable our home office to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services to our frontline operations. Our modernization efforts are progressing well, but we're not done yet, and we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front later. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken, we're pleased about where our business stands today. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract, hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Krause: Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects strong execution by the Rollins team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered strong revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up approximately 8% in the quarter and to finish the first half. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. The integration of the Fox acquisition is progressing well, and we have a growing sense of optimism around this recent investment. Second, our gross margins were healthy, exceeding 53% this quarter. We were positive on the price/cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.3% was pressured primarily by higher insurance premiums and casualty loss developments on 4 legacy auto cases. Our GAAP earnings were $0.22 per share and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition, adjusted earnings were $0.23 per share. And last but not least, we delivered approximately 16% improvement in operating cash flow while free cash flow was up approximately 18% versus the same period a year ago. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $821 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 30 basis points as the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. Turning to profitability. We realized a 40-basis point improvement in gross profit margin, where we saw good performance on gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We continue to see the benefit of a more consistent pricing discipline across all our brands this year. Looking at our 4 major buckets of service costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies and insurance and claims, we saw improvements in margins associated with materials and supplies as well as fleet costs, while insurance and claims were a headwind. People costs were also somewhat favorable to margins even as we added a significant level of pest control and termite control technicians to support strong demand trends. As Jerry said earlier, staffing levels for our frontline team members are the best they've been in years. This timing sets up well as we see strong customer demand to start the third quarter. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people cost, advertising and selling costs, along with insurance and claims make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. We saw headwinds to margins from higher insurance and automobile-related claim costs, as previously mentioned, there were settlement developments on a few auto claims cases this quarter, and we're seeing higher costs in general for auto insurance and related claims due to inflationary pressures. We continue to invest heavily in advertising efforts in the quarter, and that has helped us go after and capture healthy levels of growth. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $5 million on a pretax basis and were related to purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on this material acquisition. GAAP operating income was $155 million, up almost 15% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $160 million, up almost 19% versus the prior year. EBITDA was $182 million, up over 14% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.2%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $183 million, up over 15% and representing a 22.3% margin. And for the first half, EBITDA margins were just under 22%. It is good to see EBITDA compounding at 16% in the first half. As I have consistently indicated, I'd like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins in line with our overall EBITDA margin. However, excluding the headwinds I mentioned from insurance and auto claim developments and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition incremental margins were accretive to our margin profile. Quarterly GAAP net income was $110 million or $0.22 per share, increasing from $0.21 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $114 million or $0.23 per share. The effective tax rate was 27% in the quarter, up 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher foreign income taxes. We expect the rate to normalize at approximately 26% over the second half of this year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained very strong. We generated $141 million of free cash flow on $110 million of earnings. Quarterly free cash flow increased by almost 18% and is compounding at just under 18% in the first 6 months of this year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted to cash, was also a bright spot coming in well above 100%. We made acquisitions totaling $312 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. That remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We continue to be active in pursuing additional tuck-in acquisitions and remain very well positioned to continue to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As Jerry mentioned previously, we are excited about the strategic growth opportunities that Fox provides. So far, the Fox team and business have exceeded our expectations from a growth perspective and we see continued opportunity and momentum in their door-to-door model. A quick update on financial details. In April, we shared our expectations that Fox would add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue and $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA to our 2023 results. We now expect to deliver financial performance at the high end of both of those ranges. We continue to make progress on a number of general financial housekeeping items that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. Of note, we filed a shelf with the SEC on June 3. This filing allows for up to $1.5 billion of primary securities. And while we have no immediate need for this capital, it provides flexibility for long-term fixed rate financing and other options that complement the bank revolver that we put in place earlier this year. Additionally, the shelf allows the company to work proactively with the family should they decide to divest a portion of their holdings at some point in the future. In summary, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS.\nJosh Chan: I wanted to ask about the comments that you made regarding the trends in May and June and July. Kenneth, what do you make of the fluctuation? And I guess, based on that, how do you see the trends going forward?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. This is Jerry. The quarter was a little different than we've seen in the past. If you'll recall, back in April at our call with everyone, we talked about April was off to a really strong start, and it was, and April finished strong. May was good as well. And then we saw a pretty significant shift in and some of the demand, especially in the back half of June where it just slid. We've since gotten some of the data from Google on Google search query data that showed there was a pretty significant decline in the back half of June, and that's really what drove the volume down overall in the quarter. But then right when we got near the end of June, very beginning of July, get close to the 4th of July, it really popped. It just came back again. I think the temperatures rose considerably and the number of unique visitors to our website, just in the first couple of weeks in July improved by over 18% year-over-year. So it was it was a little weird. Normally, you see that kind of seasonality earlier in the quarter, not later, but it was a little different than we've ever seen in the past.\nJosh Chan: Okay. That's really helpful color, and that makes sense. And then I guess my follow-up, you also mentioned advertising increasing. Certainly, it makes sense to invest in that given your business model. I was just wondering what causes you to ramp up or down the advertising spend. I'm curious what you saw in Q2 that made you decide to do more advertising versus less?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Well, when we started, we had good signs in April that the environment was good. And plus, we were staffed for it. So when you're better staffed and you've got the people to service the customers and get the new customers coming in the door, that's when it's there to take there to take advantage of it. And in our business, and if you look at the fiscal year, selling recurring revenue, the earlier in the year, you get it the more revenue you get. And so we just thought the conditions were right. And I think that's worked out well for us as evidenced by the organic growth levels that we saw in the quarter.\nKenneth Krause: That\u2019s great commentary, Jerry. Josh. Just one additional item with respect to advertising. If you go back and you look at our results, say, for the fourth quarter of last year, we were conscientious in disclosing that advertising was down. And so what you saw was during the winter season, during the fourth quarter, advertising was certainly lower because demand levels are generally lower. But as you go throughout the year, you generally will see a ramping of the advertising in Q2 and Q3. And before it starts to recede a bit in Q4. So I think we\u2019ll continue to follow that same trajectory when we think about demand season for our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Luke McFadden with William Blair.\nLuke McFadden: This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. I'm curious, with inflation beginning to ease, is your above-average pricing adding any effect on new customer growth or retention? In other words, are you seeing any pushback or pricing from customer -- on pricing from customers? And how should investors think about pricing more broadly as you head into the second half of this year.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I would say we've had a little more pushback than we've had in prior years, but nothing that's insurmountable. It's still early to truly judge as we go through the year and get further into the year, we'll look closer at our rollback data and exclusion data, this really get an effect of what happened and whether or not customers canceled over. We'll have all our metrics as we move through the year. I would say it hasn't, it hasn't been a significant issue for us thus far this year. Now the questions as you move through the year, we watch that further depending on the economic environment. We have to moderate that. Ken will -- our plan is to evaluate pricing towards the latter part of this year once all the data and we'll go from there as we think about a futuristic...\nKenneth Krause: Yes, that's correct. But I do I also want to add that we continue to believe that our services are essential. We do believe that there's definitely value in our pricing model. But we are conscientious of price and what impact that has in our customer base. And so we'll continue to monitor that. We'll continue to monitor economic trends, but we won't lose sight of the essential value of our services. So Stay tuned on that. But that's, I think, how we think about it, Josh.\nJerry Gahlhoff: That was Luke.\nLuke McFadden : Great. And if I can follow up just with one more maybe on gross margins here. It looks like gross margins were up 40 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter. We know Fox has pretty high gross margins, just given the nature of that business. How much of that gross margin expansion do you think could be attributed to the contribution from Fox? And can you touch on the other factors just helping to drive that gross margin expansion in the second quarter? I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but -- any further commentary there would be helpful.\nKenneth Krause: Yes. It\u2019s Ken, Luke, and I\u2019ll take that question. You\u2019re exactly right. The Fox acquisition is a very valuable acquisition and the gross margin reflects the value on their business model. It is accretive to the overall margin profile of Rollins. But it only contributed about $39 million of revenue in the quarter. So it\u2019s not that meaningful. It did have a positive impact on the gross margin, but we also saw a positive impact across our organic business, primarily through better leveraging of fleet costs, better leveraging of people costs and materials and supplies. It's interesting, when I step back and I look at the fleet cost, you would expect fleet costs to improve with gasoline prices. But the thing I think people are missing at times is the fact that used car prices aren\u2019t as attractive. So when we turn in lease vehicles or when we sell lease vehicles, we\u2019re not seeing as much of a gain as we did last year at this time. So we\u2019re seeing good improvement in our organic business despite that headwind. And we also are seeing improvement associated with the Fox acquisition coming through our gross profit margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nHarold Antor: This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. So you talked about productivity initiatives. So I just want to get an idea of what investments that you're making out of the company becoming a little bit more productive.\nKenneth Krause: Yes. I would add -- or I would say to that point, we, like most other companies have a list of a number of opportunities that we continue to evaluate across the restructuring area. We're looking at all areas of the business. And as Jerry had talked about as well as myself, continuous improvement is a big focus of our company. And so when we look at, for example, our home office, we are continuing to look at ways we can enhance and improve the home office, but we're also looking more broadly across the business. So can't give you one specific initiative, but it's really across all of our footprint that we're really evaluating opportunities to improve the business from a productivity perspective.\nHarold Antor: And then just on the residential deceleration. It looks like resi slowed down. And sequentially on year-over-year. So if you could give us any puts and takes on resi growth, resi organic growth? And how should we think about resi organic growth looking forward to the back half of the year?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. When we look back at the quarter and compare it to other recent quarters, we look at it as though June was a bit of an anomaly. June was a really weird month that affected that. I mean we were \u2013 in April and May, organic growth was in that double-digit range, that we were expecting. And then in June kind of threw us for a loop with what went on there. So we\u2019ve started the quarter out back on track with more in line with what we expected, and we don\u2019t see any signs. Of course, you don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but certainly, we\u2019ll make every attempt to continue to drive higher levels on the organic residential growth side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America.\nJason Haas: Just following up on that monthly sales cadence. It sounds like maybe it was some cold spring weather maybe push them sales out into July. I'm curious, in prior years where you've had a cold spring, do you see the business shift into July and maybe even further into August and September? Just trying to think about that 10% organic growth number you started in July, and if there's anything to be cognizant of in terms of the compares, whether they get easier and harder through the quarter in August and September?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Again, you think about seasonality, and sorry to say this last quarter was different because normally, when we talk about cooler spring, cooler early summer, that's usually happening in March and April. And usually, it hits. So this quarter, it was just -- it was really different than one I'd say we've seen in many, many years. Now is that to say there's some pent-up demand. We certainly have seen that in July, where once temperatures got to -- I don't know, a few weeks ago, we were in California, Ken, and when we arrived that day, in the middle of the day, it was like 75 degrees. But then by the weekend, it was 110 degrees in Northern California and the phones were ringing off the hook. So it was very -- So we had some very unseasonably cool weather in June, which is kind of an anomaly. So I don't know what else to say...\nKenneth Krause : Yes. It's just adding on there. Weather always has an impact across the business. What really helps us to is those warm evenings when evening stay above a certain level, the low temperature doesn't get too low. And so when you see that, you certainly have a benefit in the business. And so it certainly does continue to have a nice positive impact on the business. As we think about comparables, I don't see anything year-over-year that has a huge impact on comparables from a weather or from a revenue performance perspective. Jason. But we feel, as we said in our prepared comments, we feel very good about how we're positioned to deliver a strong second half in 2023.\nJason Haas: That's great. And then for a follow-up, I was going to ask on the incremental EBITDA margins. I know you said previously, and we're seeing it play out that the plan was to invest more in some customer acquisition costs. So you're a little bit below the 30% target this quarter. Is that a fair framework? I think you're in the low 20% range or so this quarter. Is that a fair assumption to use for the near term? Or do you think in the next few quarters, you can get back to that 30% level that you target?\nKenneth Krause: So it\u2019s interesting, Jason. If you look at the LTM number as of June 30, the LTM incremental margin is 29.3%. So it\u2019s almost 30%. That\u2019s up strongly from the prior year. And so when we look over a long period of time a 12-month period, we\u2019re certainly trending at those levels that we talked about. This one quarter, what we saw in the second quarter, you might see it a bit in the third quarter, is you\u2019re investing. It\u2019s time to invest. It\u2019s time to go after and acquire those customers that you\u2019re going to keep for years to come. And so you see even our incrementals may be weighed down a little bit by that. But the fact that the incrementals were accretive to our actual margin profile that provides me a sense of optimism. We\u2019re in an investment period, and we\u2019re actually still seeing incrementals that are accretive to our EBITDA margin. That\u2019s a good thing to see. And so we\u2019re hopeful that, that will continue as we go into the third quarter. But our goal long term is that 30% incremental margin profile. There\u2019s no reason this business shouldn\u2019t get to those levels based upon the pricing that we get based upon the essential nature of our services, based upon our customer experience that our service technicians and our associates are providing our customers. And so we feel good about that incremental margin target longer term.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo Securities.\nJohn Mazzoni : Maybe just following up on this insurance issue. I think you believe you mentioned 4 claims in the quarter and about a 40-basis point drag. Could you maybe just quantify if there's any other kind of legacy settlements in the pipeline that could hit in the future quarters? And also, how should we think about higher insurance costs as we move through the year? Should they maybe step down as the driver safety improves? Or are higher insurance costs more of a function of just the environment we're currently in?\nKenneth Krause : Yes. First and foremost, what I would say is our accruals at June 30 are complete and accurate. And so when we look at the liability associated, for example, with auto claims, we feel like it's complete. We do know that things change. And so as facts, as circumstances change, estimates change. And that's what we would do as we move forward. you really started to see this tick up last year in the third quarter. We had around $10 million of claims that came through that settlements came through. And it's interesting when you look at what happened during COVID, claims have certainly -- they've certainly trended down quite a bit, courts closed a bit, settlement activity went down. And then coming out of COVID, you start to ramp. We're hopeful that we'll see that turn down as we go into the future. But you're just not sure what's going to happen on that front. What you can do, however, is focus on the controllables. And what Jerry had talked about in his comments, was focusing on putting systems and processes and the focus behind behavioral-based safety into the business that will mitigate these exposures as we move forward. And so we're doing just that. And we're hopeful that, that activity will have a positive impact on our experience in this -- our unfortunate experience in this area.\nJohn Mazzoni : Got it. Great color. And maybe also just following up on this investment period. Could you just quantify the kind of return on ad spend or maybe even at a high level, just your kind of customer acquisition cost at kind of either digital or linear. We've seen kind of a lower TV upfront market and potentially others pulling back. So could that be potential upside if you can get these kind of ad dollars and your customer acquisition costs down.\nKenneth Krause: What I would say and I would ask Jerry to comment, too, was if I look at our organic growth profile and I compare it to our overall market growth, our organic growth, as we said in our prepared commentary, is roughly 8%. The markets, what we expect the markets to be growing at are much below 8%. So when we think about the organic growth profile and we think about the share that we are gaining in our markets, we feel good about the return levels knowing that incremental margins can be around that 30% and a customer might stay with us for 3, 5 or even 7 years. So we feel really good about the returns that we're getting on those ad dollars.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes. I mean just factor in the lifetime value of a customer and what that customer means to us over the long term as a worthy spends. And we do a very good job of monitoring cost of customer acquisition, cost to lead, and we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019re spending to generate that long-term recurring revenue stream.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel.\nAadit Shrestha: This is Aadit Shrestha from Stifel filling in for Michael Hoffman today. So just going to your cash flow, you had a very strong free cash flow conversion in 2Q. Were there any specific factors that influence this in the period? And would you expect the conversion to be like lower in the second half?\nKenneth Krause: When we look at the cash flow conversion, we're really happy with the performance that we saw in Q2, but also the first half of the year. Our focus is to continue to drive compounding of free cash flow in that mid-teen range. And the fact that we saw free cash flow compound at roughly 17%, 18% in the quarter, it provides us a sense of optimism heading into the future. I don't know that we're ready to increase our expectations in the 18% or 20% compounding of cash flow. But if we can continue to see compounding of cash flow in that 14% to 15% or so percent, which is in line with what we've compounded cash flow at over the last 20 or so years. I think we would be happy with that performance. Nothing really jumps off the page at me in terms of what's driving cash flow improvement in the quarter. I know the FOX business has a bit of a different business model when you look at the door-to-door side. And so payables stepped up a little bit with respect to that business model, that actually had a positive impact on cash flow. But overall, we feel good about cash flow and we feel good about the generation of cash that we're seeing.\nAadit Shrestha : And just as a follow-up. Your largest customer mentioned that the deal valuations have come down as private equity is spending less for deals. Are you seeing a similar trend? And does this drive like an outsized year of deals, excluding the Fox acquisition?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Sure. I completely heard or understood the question. Were you asking more about the PE space and what we're seeing from a...\nAadit Shrestha: Just overall sort of what multiples are being paid for acquisitions are lower now. That's what they're seeing. And if you're seeing a sort of similar type of trend. And would this sort of mean you do more M&A than usual?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I wouldn't necessarily say it's come down significantly. I've seen some PE deals that have transacted at pretty high valuations early this year. I would say there's also been maybe some PE deals out there that haven't made it to closing. So it seems to be it's still a pretty rich environment. It may have softened a little bit, Ken. We measure that pretty closely and kind of watch all of our transactions. I don't necessarily think it means we're going to go more aggressive or try to bite off more than we can choose. We will always remain disciplined about picking the right -- the right acquisitions, the companies with the right culture, the people that care about the business and have the right type of fit for Rollins. And that no matter what the valuation is, that's the biggest thing we look. That's where we start. Ken, what would you add?\nKenneth Krause : Yes. The only thing I would add is, I mean, we can speak about our experience. And our experience is we\u2019ve been investing at very healthy multiples, not necessarily aggressive levels we are getting deals at fair values. But it\u2019s interesting. The one thing that certainly has an impact on the M&A markets is interest rates. And as interest rates tick up, ultimately, some buyers value businesses at a much lower level. You just can\u2019t get there with certain levels of interest rates. So that certainly has potentially an impact on the M&A environment. But what Jerry said is spot on. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on buying good businesses, paying fair values and businesses that align with our culture and our focus and value their team members, value their brands. That\u2019s the kind of business we want to bring into the fold, and we feel like we got that with Fox.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ollie Davies with Redburn Partners.\nOllie Davies: On the residential side, can you just talk about the split of organic growth between kind of cross-selling into the existing customer base and your ability to add new customers, given the macro environment?\nKenneth Krause: The focus on cross-sell, the focus on ancillary is a key part of the strategy. We don't necessarily provide the detailed growth levels for ancillary or for cross-sell or multiple services with any one customer. But what I can tell you is we're seeing really good growth from a number of different services. Like, for example, you might have an individual that signs up for pest control and they're adding mosquito because mosquito demand is incredibly strong or you might see a termite customer or another pest control customer that is signing up for cross space work or insulation work. And so we're still seeing continued good demand for those ancillary and additional services across the business.\nOllie Davies: Great. And then as a follow-up, on the commercial, obviously remains very strong. What are the sort of typical types of commercial venues that you're adding at the moment? And do you think this can continue, given, I guess, the kind of historical volume growth that Commercial delivered before the pandemic?\nJerry Gahlhoff : We haven't seen any slowdown in our ability to sell and bring on new commercial customers. We are more focused on certain verticals that we really like to sell into -- logistics, health care, hospitality, things along those lines where we try to be pretty fairly disciplined about the customers that we're really proactively targeting. But we have a very effective sales force. We've continued to invest in that sales force and ramp up those sales efforts, and we feel very positively about the future of the commercial business.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you on the third quarter earnings call in October. Thanks again.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kenneth Krause",
            "content": "Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects strong execution by the Rollins team. Let me begin with a few highlights. First, we delivered strong revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Organic revenue was up approximately 8% in the quarter and to finish the first half. Acquisitions drove the other 7% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. The integration of the Fox acquisition is progressing well, and we have a growing sense of optimism around this recent investment. Second, our gross margins were healthy, exceeding 53% this quarter. We were positive on the price/cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.3% was pressured primarily by higher insurance premiums and casualty loss developments on 4 legacy auto cases. Our GAAP earnings were $0.22 per share and excluding certain expenses related to the Fox acquisition, adjusted earnings were $0.23 per share. And last but not least, we delivered approximately 16% improvement in operating cash flow while free cash flow was up approximately 18% versus the same period a year ago. Let's look at the quarterly results in a little bit more detail. Quarterly revenue was $821 million, up 15% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced revenue growth by 30 basis points as the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. Turning to profitability. We realized a 40-basis point improvement in gross profit margin, where we saw good performance on gross profit as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We continue to see the benefit of a more consistent pricing discipline across all our brands this year. Looking at our 4 major buckets of service costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies and insurance and claims, we saw improvements in margins associated with materials and supplies as well as fleet costs, while insurance and claims were a headwind. People costs were also somewhat favorable to margins even as we added a significant level of pest control and termite control technicians to support strong demand trends. As Jerry said earlier, staffing levels for our frontline team members are the best they've been in years. This timing sets up well as we see strong customer demand to start the third quarter. SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue increased by 30 basis points in the quarter. Peeling back the SG&A layers a bit more, people cost, advertising and selling costs, along with insurance and claims make up the bulk of our SG&A spend. We saw headwinds to margins from higher insurance and automobile-related claim costs, as previously mentioned, there were settlement developments on a few auto claims cases this quarter, and we're seeing higher costs in general for auto insurance and related claims due to inflationary pressures. We continue to invest heavily in advertising efforts in the quarter, and that has helped us go after and capture healthy levels of growth. As I mentioned earlier, we had non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for Fox acquisition-related items. These totaled approximately $5 million on a pretax basis and were related to purchase accounting amortization and the fair value of contingent consideration on this material acquisition. GAAP operating income was $155 million, up almost 15% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $160 million, up almost 19% versus the prior year. EBITDA was $182 million, up over 14% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.2%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $183 million, up over 15% and representing a 22.3% margin. And for the first half, EBITDA margins were just under 22%. It is good to see EBITDA compounding at 16% in the first half. As I have consistently indicated, I'd like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning what percentage of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins in line with our overall EBITDA margin. However, excluding the headwinds I mentioned from insurance and auto claim developments and the additional costs associated with the earn-out on our recent acquisition incremental margins were accretive to our margin profile. Quarterly GAAP net income was $110 million or $0.22 per share, increasing from $0.21 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $114 million or $0.23 per share. The effective tax rate was 27% in the quarter, up 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher foreign income taxes. We expect the rate to normalize at approximately 26% over the second half of this year. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly free cash flow remained very strong. We generated $141 million of free cash flow on $110 million of earnings. Quarterly free cash flow increased by almost 18% and is compounding at just under 18% in the first 6 months of this year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted to cash, was also a bright spot coming in well above 100%. We made acquisitions totaling $312 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. That remains negligible and debt-to-EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We continue to be active in pursuing additional tuck-in acquisitions and remain very well positioned to continue to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As Jerry mentioned previously, we are excited about the strategic growth opportunities that Fox provides. So far, the Fox team and business have exceeded our expectations from a growth perspective and we see continued opportunity and momentum in their door-to-door model. A quick update on financial details. In April, we shared our expectations that Fox would add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue and $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA to our 2023 results. We now expect to deliver financial performance at the high end of both of those ranges. We continue to make progress on a number of general financial housekeeping items that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. Of note, we filed a shelf with the SEC on June 3. This filing allows for up to $1.5 billion of primary securities. And while we have no immediate need for this capital, it provides flexibility for long-term fixed rate financing and other options that complement the bank revolver that we put in place earlier this year. Additionally, the shelf allows the company to work proactively with the family should they decide to divest a portion of their holdings at some point in the future. In summary, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. That's great commentary, Jerry. Josh. Just one additional item with respect to advertising. If you go back and you look at our results, say, for the fourth quarter of last year, we were conscientious in disclosing that advertising was down. And so what you saw was during the winter season, during the fourth quarter, advertising was certainly lower because demand levels are generally lower. But as you go throughout the year, you generally will see a ramping of the advertising in Q2 and Q3. And before it starts to recede a bit in Q4. So I think we'll continue to follow that same trajectory when we think about demand season for our business. Yes, that's correct. But I do I also want to add that we continue to believe that our services are essential. We do believe that there's definitely value in our pricing model. But we are conscientious of price and what impact that has in our customer base. And so we'll continue to monitor that. We'll continue to monitor economic trends, but we won't lose sight of the essential value of our services. So Stay tuned on that. But that's, I think, how we think about it, Josh. Yes. It's Ken, Luke, and I'll take that question. You're exactly right. The Fox acquisition is a very valuable acquisition and the gross margin reflects the value on their business model. It is accretive to the overall margin profile of Rollins. But it only contributed about $39 million of revenue in the quarter. So it's not that meaningful. It did have a positive impact on the gross margin, but we also saw a positive impact across our organic business, primarily through better leveraging of fleet costs, better leveraging of people costs and materials and supplies. It's interesting, when I step back and I look at the fleet cost, you would expect fleet costs to improve with gasoline prices. But the thing I think people are missing at times is the fact that used car prices aren't as attractive. So when we turn in lease vehicles or when we sell lease vehicles, we're not seeing as much of a gain as we did last year at this time. So we're seeing good improvement in our organic business despite that headwind. And we also are seeing improvement associated with the Fox acquisition coming through our gross profit margin. Yes. I would add -- or I would say to that point, we, like most other companies have a list of a number of opportunities that we continue to evaluate across the restructuring area. We're looking at all areas of the business. And as Jerry had talked about as well as myself, continuous improvement is a big focus of our company. And so when we look at, for example, our home office, we are continuing to look at ways we can enhance and improve the home office, but we're also looking more broadly across the business. So can't give you one specific initiative, but it's really across all of our footprint that we're really evaluating opportunities to improve the business from a productivity perspective. Yes. It's just adding on there. Weather always has an impact across the business. What really helps us to is those warm evenings when evening stay above a certain level, the low temperature doesn't get too low. And so when you see that, you certainly have a benefit in the business. And so it certainly does continue to have a nice positive impact on the business. As we think about comparables, I don't see anything year-over-year that has a huge impact on comparables from a weather or from a revenue performance perspective. Jason. But we feel, as we said in our prepared comments, we feel very good about how we're positioned to deliver a strong second half in 2023. So it's interesting, Jason. If you look at the LTM number as of June 30, the LTM incremental margin is 29.3%. So it's almost 30%. That's up strongly from the prior year. And so when we look over a long period of time a 12-month period, we're certainly trending at those levels that we talked about. This one quarter, what we saw in the second quarter, you might see it a bit in the third quarter, is you're investing. It's time to invest. It's time to go after and acquire those customers that you're going to keep for years to come. And so you see even our incrementals may be weighed down a little bit by that. But the fact that the incrementals were accretive to our actual margin profile that provides me a sense of optimism. We're in an investment period, and we're actually still seeing incrementals that are accretive to our EBITDA margin. That's a good thing to see. And so we're hopeful that, that will continue as we go into the third quarter. But our goal long term is that 30% incremental margin profile. There's no reason this business shouldn't get to those levels based upon the pricing that we get based upon the essential nature of our services, based upon our customer experience that our service technicians and our associates are providing our customers. And so we feel good about that incremental margin target longer term. Yes. First and foremost, what I would say is our accruals at June 30 are complete and accurate. And so when we look at the liability associated, for example, with auto claims, we feel like it's complete. We do know that things change. And so as facts, as circumstances change, estimates change. And that's what we would do as we move forward. you really started to see this tick up last year in the third quarter. We had around $10 million of claims that came through that settlements came through. And it's interesting when you look at what happened during COVID, claims have certainly -- they've certainly trended down quite a bit, courts closed a bit, settlement activity went down. And then coming out of COVID, you start to ramp. We're hopeful that we'll see that turn down as we go into the future. But you're just not sure what's going to happen on that front. What you can do, however, is focus on the controllables. And what Jerry had talked about in his comments, was focusing on putting systems and processes and the focus behind behavioral-based safety into the business that will mitigate these exposures as we move forward. And so we're doing just that. And we're hopeful that, that activity will have a positive impact on our experience in this -- our unfortunate experience in this area. What I would say and I would ask Jerry to comment, too, was if I look at our organic growth profile and I compare it to our overall market growth, our organic growth, as we said in our prepared commentary, is roughly 8%. The markets, what we expect the markets to be growing at are much below 8%. So when we think about the organic growth profile and we think about the share that we are gaining in our markets, we feel good about the return levels knowing that incremental margins can be around that 30% and a customer might stay with us for 3, 5 or even 7 years. So we feel really good about the returns that we're getting on those ad dollars. When we look at the cash flow conversion, we're really happy with the performance that we saw in Q2, but also the first half of the year. Our focus is to continue to drive compounding of free cash flow in that mid-teen range. And the fact that we saw free cash flow compound at roughly 17%, 18% in the quarter, it provides us a sense of optimism heading into the future. I don't know that we're ready to increase our expectations in the 18% or 20% compounding of cash flow. But if we can continue to see compounding of cash flow in that 14% to 15% or so percent, which is in line with what we've compounded cash flow at over the last 20 or so years. I think we would be happy with that performance. Nothing really jumps off the page at me in terms of what's driving cash flow improvement in the quarter. I know the FOX business has a bit of a different business model when you look at the door-to-door side. And so payables stepped up a little bit with respect to that business model, that actually had a positive impact on cash flow. But overall, we feel good about cash flow and we feel good about the generation of cash that we're seeing. Yes. The only thing I would add is, I mean, we can speak about our experience. And our experience is we've been investing at very healthy multiples, not necessarily aggressive levels we are getting deals at fair values. But it's interesting. The one thing that certainly has an impact on the M&A markets is interest rates. And as interest rates tick up, ultimately, some buyers value businesses at a much lower level. You just can't get there with certain levels of interest rates. So that certainly has potentially an impact on the M&A environment. But what Jerry said is spot on. We're going to continue to focus on buying good businesses, paying fair values and businesses that align with our culture and our focus and value their team members, value their brands. That's the kind of business we want to bring into the fold, and we feel like we got that with Fox. The focus on cross-sell, the focus on ancillary is a key part of the strategy. We don't necessarily provide the detailed growth levels for ancillary or for cross-sell or multiple services with any one customer. But what I can tell you is we're seeing really good growth from a number of different services. Like, for example, you might have an individual that signs up for pest control and they're adding mosquito because mosquito demand is incredibly strong or you might see a termite customer or another pest control customer that is signing up for cross space work or insulation work. And so we're still seeing continued good demand for those ancillary and additional services across the business."

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of approximately 15% to $821 million. I'm very pleased to report that we continue to see organic growth of approximately 8%. Further, this reflects a solid performance across all major service lines. Commercial pest control rose approximately 11%, residential increased over 18%, and termite was up approximately 14% this quarter. Revenue performance in the quarter was healthy, although a little uneven due to pest seasonality. On a month-to-month basis, organic growth was very robust at 10% in May before slowing a bit in June. We're back on a good trajectory now in July, in line with what we saw in May. Importantly, our frontline team member staffing levels are better than we've seen in several years, and that is providing us with an opportunity to capitalize on demand for our services. I'm also quite pleased with the progress we're making this far with the Fox Pest Control acquisition, the second largest acquisition in the history of our company. Taking a closer look, the integration of Fox has gone smoothly over the past few months. The Fox teams are executing and doing very well. The transaction was accretive to our second quarter earnings. This continues to be an exciting, highly complementary addition and we believe the revenue growth achieved this quarter is reflective of the team's focus on execution. The team at Fox was not distracted by the shift in ownership to Rollins and was focused on their customers and growing their business. Making for a smooth transition is a key tenet of our acquisition integration strategy, and our collective teams were diligent about not disrupting these efforts of our frontline team members post close. I'd like to express my thanks to the Fox team and all our teammates that have worked hard to make this happen, and we're very excited about the growth opportunities ahead for the Fox brand. Next, we continue to have an enhanced capital structure and a robust acquisition pipeline as we're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As I've highlighted in the past, Acquisitions are an important component in helping us expand our market position while also complementing efforts to accelerate recurring organic growth. We remain disciplined in evaluating M&A opportunities and feel very good about our continued ability to invest in strategic acquisitions while delivering strong organic growth across the business. Another important part of our culture is our dedication to continuous improvement. As you've heard us discuss previously, we're constantly looking to improve our service levels and operating efficiencies. As a result, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion as we move forward and execute our strategy. We are currently evaluating several streamlining efforts. Kim will provide more detail and address the margins in the quarter shortly. In addition to the unrelenting focus on productivity and improving our margin profile, we're also more strongly focused on safety. Our experience was disappointing in this area in Q2 as we continue to see higher settlements associated primarily with auto accidents. This was a $0.01 per share drag on earnings this quarter versus a year ago. We have ramped up efforts to significantly reduce automobile accidents moving forward. Our drivers now utilize an app that begins monitoring driving behaviors once our vehicle is in motion. This app detects unsafe driving maneuvers, such as acceleration, braking, distractions and speed and then converts these data into an industry-accepted FICO driving score from 100 to 850, with 850 being the best. The data indicate that drivers with scores below 710 are 30% more likely to have a collision than those with higher scores. We're working hard in the field to increase driver safety awareness and get these scores up by coaching and training those with lower scores while recognizing and rewarding those that score the highest. We believe these efforts will help us keep people safe and mitigate negative potential financial impact to our business. On the investment side, we proactively increased customer acquisition-related efforts during the second quarter and strategically invested more heavily on advertising spend when compared with the same quarter a year ago and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. While these costs were a $0.01 drag on second quarter earnings, we saw meaningful opportunities to go after and acquire new customers during the start of the busier spring and summer seasons. Given that approximately 80% of our business is recurring, I want to emphasize that the opportunity for us to attract potential new customers is very important and it's a strategic investment over the long term. To date, we're extremely pleased with our targeted marketing and advertising efforts, which we believe is reflected in our strong organic growth performance for the quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue into the third quarter of 2023. Next, we continue to focus on modernizing our business, our capital structure and our organization. As you may recall, in February, we enhanced our capital structure by refinancing our revolver, increasing it from $175 million in 2 banks up to $1 billion in 8 banks, providing us with investment-grade flexibility. More recently, our approximately $1.5 billion universal shelf facility was declared effective by the SEC. This facility provides additional financial capital and flexibility to the company, and Ken will share some additional details on this in a moment. Operationally, we're committed to developing great talent and investing in our teams. Hiring has been healthy, and we've put a lot of energy into onboarding the right people in both the support functions and the customer-facing side of our business. As we look ahead to the improvement opportunity in front of us, we're focused on upgrading and realigning key areas in our home office support functions. You've heard us talk about opportunities in this area, and we are evaluating several initiatives as we start the second half of 2023. We believe that driving this type of change will provide opportunities to accelerate our growth goals and enable our home office to become a better, more efficient provider of shared services to our frontline operations. Our modernization efforts are progressing well, but we're not done yet, and we look forward to sharing additional developments on this front later. In closing, before I turn the call over to Ken, we're pleased about where our business stands today. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and remain focused on robust organic growth, delivering healthy incremental margins and continuing to attract, hire and retain top talent across the business. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Yes. This is Jerry. The quarter was a little different than we've seen in the past. If you'll recall, back in April at our call with everyone, we talked about April was off to a really strong start, and it was, and April finished strong. May was good as well. And then we saw a pretty significant shift in and some of the demand, especially in the back half of June where it just slid. We've since gotten some of the data from Google on Google search query data that showed there was a pretty significant decline in the back half of June, and that's really what drove the volume down overall in the quarter. But then right when we got near the end of June, very beginning of July, get close to the 4th of July, it really popped. It just came back again. I think the temperatures rose considerably and the number of unique visitors to our website, just in the first couple of weeks in July improved by over 18% year-over-year. So it was it was a little weird. Normally, you see that kind of seasonality earlier in the quarter, not later, but it was a little different than we've ever seen in the past. Well, when we started, we had good signs in April that the environment was good. And plus, we were staffed for it. So when you're better staffed and you've got the people to service the customers and get the new customers coming in the door, that's when it's there to take there to take advantage of it. And in our business, and if you look at the fiscal year, selling recurring revenue, the earlier in the year, you get it the more revenue you get. And so we just thought the conditions were right. And I think that's worked out well for us as evidenced by the organic growth levels that we saw in the quarter. I would say we've had a little more pushback than we've had in prior years, but nothing that's insurmountable. It's still early to truly judge as we go through the year and get further into the year, we'll look closer at our rollback data and exclusion data, this really get an effect of what happened and whether or not customers canceled over. We'll have all our metrics as we move through the year. I would say it hasn't, it hasn't been a significant issue for us thus far this year. Now the questions as you move through the year, we watch that further depending on the economic environment. We have to moderate that. Ken will -- our plan is to evaluate pricing towards the latter part of this year once all the data and we'll go from there as we think about a futuristic... That was Luke. Yes. When we look back at the quarter and compare it to other recent quarters, we look at it as though June was a bit of an anomaly. June was a really weird month that affected that. I mean we were \u2013 in April and May, organic growth was in that double-digit range, that we were expecting. And then in June kind of threw us for a loop with what went on there. So we've started the quarter out back on track with more in line with what we expected, and we don't see any signs. Of course, you don't have a crystal ball, but certainly, we'll make every attempt to continue to drive higher levels on the organic residential growth side. Again, you think about seasonality, and sorry to say this last quarter was different because normally, when we talk about cooler spring, cooler early summer, that's usually happening in March and April. And usually, it hits. So this quarter, it was just -- it was really different than one I'd say we've seen in many, many years. Now is that to say there's some pent-up demand. We certainly have seen that in July, where once temperatures got to -- I don't know, a few weeks ago, we were in California, Ken, and when we arrived that day, in the middle of the day, it was like 75 degrees. But then by the weekend, it was 110 degrees in Northern California and the phones were ringing off the hook. So it was very -- So we had some very unseasonably cool weather in June, which is kind of an anomaly. So I don't know what else to say... Yes. I mean just factor in the lifetime value of a customer and what that customer means to us over the long term as a worthy spends. And we do a very good job of monitoring cost of customer acquisition, cost to lead, and we're very comfortable with what we're spending to generate that long-term recurring revenue stream. Sure. I completely heard or understood the question. Were you asking more about the PE space and what we're seeing from a... I wouldn't necessarily say it's come down significantly. I've seen some PE deals that have transacted at pretty high valuations early this year. I would say there's also been maybe some PE deals out there that haven't made it to closing. So it seems to be it's still a pretty rich environment. It may have softened a little bit, Ken. We measure that pretty closely and kind of watch all of our transactions. I don't necessarily think it means we're going to go more aggressive or try to bite off more than we can choose. We will always remain disciplined about picking the right -- the right acquisitions, the companies with the right culture, the people that care about the business and have the right type of fit for Rollins. And that no matter what the valuation is, that's the biggest thing we look. That's where we start. Ken, what would you add? We haven't seen any slowdown in our ability to sell and bring on new commercial customers. We are more focused on certain verticals that we really like to sell into -- logistics, health care, hospitality, things along those lines where we try to be pretty fairly disciplined about the customers that we're really proactively targeting. But we have a very effective sales force. We've continued to invest in that sales force and ramp up those sales efforts, and we feel very positively about the future of the commercial business. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you on the third quarter earnings call in October. Thanks again."

We continued to deliver solid performance across most -- all of our brands and achieved healthy levels of customer growth. Before I turn the call over to Jerry, I want to comment briefly on the results of our recent acquisition of Fox Pest Control. We closed on the Fox acquisition in April, just prior to the ramp-up of their selling season, and they have performed exceptionally well as they achieved solid growth in the first quarter of our ownership. In addition, we have been pleased with their earnings contribution as they achieved over $2 million of GAAP earnings in the first quarter of ownership. This is inclusive of a $1 million charge associated with our earn-out of the deal. Our transition with Fox has gone quite well, and we're excited to have their great team and the Fox brand as part of Rollins. Now let me turn the call over to Jerry, who will provide more details on our quarter."

We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm pleased to report, Rollins delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by revenue growth of over 11%, and earnings per share growth of 20%. I want to begin by welcoming P. Russell Hardin as Rollins newest board member. Russ was elected to our Board at our recent shareholder meeting, and has served as President of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation since 2006. He serves as a Director of Genuine Parts Company, as well as a trustee of the Northwestern Mutual Company. Hardin practiced law with the firm of King & Spalding, and as a long-time resident of Atlanta, has served this community in ways too numerous to list. Please help me welcome Russ Hardin.  Now turning to the Fox Pest Control acquisition, I'm very excited about this recent event. Enjoying a strong reputation in the marketplace, we have long respected Fox's history of success. In fact, I have a relationship with one of their founders, Mike Romney, going back close to 20 years, as Mike began doing summer sales programs for Orkin prior to co-founding Fox. Fox Pest Control was formally established in 2012, initially marketing through the door-to-door sales effort in historically underserved pest control markets. Through consistent growth and expansion, Fox now provides general pest control services for homeowners from 32 locations in 13 States. Fox evolved in their growth strategies to include other streams, as now about a third of their customers are acquired through digital channels. Not only does Fox rank as the 13th largest pest management company, according to the PCT 100 rankings, Fox also received recognition in 2021 by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing private companies in America. In many of the markets they serve, Fox is a market leader with a great service reputation. I cannot stress enough what a great addition this is to our family of brands, and I'll now hand the call over to Jerry to recap Rollin's first quarter results, and talk about the transaction in greater detail.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Our partnership with Fox was an 18-month process. As we worked on executing this transaction and learned more about the Fox business, we became increasingly impressed with their culture, their consistent and strong growth rates, and their unique operating model. In early April, I had the opportunity to visit with many of the fantastic team members at Fox, and was able to witness firsthand the deep pride they have in the Fox brand. Additionally, as Ken will cover in more detail later, we believe the financial benefits are very compelling. We expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first full year of ownership, and will provide meaningful long-term financial benefits as well. We also believe the complementary nature of their brand creates opportunities for enhancing Rollins's strategic platform for growth in the residential space. While still operating under the Fox Pest Control brand and being led by co-founders Mike Romney, and Bryant White, we see incredible potential for the teams at Fox and HomeTeam to learn and share with one another. There are multiple benefits to tying Fox closely with HomeTeam, who have also been utilizing door-to-door campaigns to activate Taexx customers in their predominantly residential business for over 20 years. Furthermore, this alliance will provide HomeTeam with an ability to scale markets faster while we provide the team at Fox with new service offerings and cross-sell opportunities along the way. We're also particularly excited about the strong alignment of their culture and the value the partnership creates for customers, team members, and to our shareholders. Fox has a passionate sense of community and a values-driven approach that consistently delivers quality service, coupled with the resilient track record of strong customer growth and solid employee retention. As we've demonstrated in the past, acquisitions are a key part of Rollins's growth strategy. Over the years, we've built a very successful playbook for their smooth transitions into our company, and we are extremely excited about our path ahead with Fox. In summary, we are confident that Fox's business perfectly aligns to our strategy for sustainable profitable growth, and I'm incredibly proud to add them to our impressive family of pest control brands.  Transitioning to our recent financial performance, I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment, but I'd like to highlight three key areas of progress in the quarter. First, we delivered 11% revenue growth. What was especially encouraging was our organic growth. Organic growth was more than 9% for the quarter, with strong growth across all major service lines. Secondly, margins were very healthy to start the year. We delivered approximately 32% incremental margins and grew GAAP earnings per share 20%. The focus on pricing, selling new business, and productivity is paying off. On our year-end call, we discussed our intention to initiate an earlier price increase this year, and that certainly helped us, particularly in March. We'll continue to focus on this area to ensure that we are effectively pricing the value of our essential services. And last, but not least, we reported strong growth and cash flow for the quarter. We remain well positioned to continue to invest in acquisitions, and maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As we move into spring and summer months, we expect a good business environment and strong demand for our services when you consider recent weather patterns resulting in wet outdoor conditions. April is off to a favorable start, and our teams in the field are well staffed and trained as we head into our traditional peak season. We're also continuing to add to our sales force and emphasizing bundling of multiple services like pest and mosquito through our call center operations. I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins\u2019s strong first quarter performance. And looking ahead, we remain well positioned for 2023 and confident in our ability to continue to drive strong operating results.  I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Krause: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The team delivered a strong start to the year. Let me begin with a few financial highlights for the first quarter of 2023. First, we delivered over 11% revenue growth in the first quarter, with robust growth across all our service offerings. Acquisitions drove approximately 2% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. We expect to see meaningful improvement in growth from acquisitions for the remainder of the year, stemming from the acquisition of Fox we announced earlier this month. Second, our continued emphasis on margin improvements drove 130 basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins in the quarter. I will speak about incremental margins shortly, but as Jerry indicated, they were a bright spot. GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.18 per share. And last, but not least, we delivered a 15% improvement in operating cash flow, and a 17% improvement in free cash flow. Let's look at the quarterly results in more detail. Starting off with revenue, it was $658 million, up just over 11% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced quarterly revenue growth by 60 basis points on the stronger dollar, notably versus the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the Australian dollar.  Turning to profitability, we realized 30 basis points improvement in gross profit margin. Gross profit margins were 50.3% of revenue in the quarter. We saw good performance on gross profit, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We were more consistent in raising prices across all of our brands this year. We discussed our intent to do this on our year-end call, and it was good to see the impact of the steps we took on revenue and profitability. Looking at four major buckets of costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies, and insurance and claims. These comprise approximately 90% of cost of services in the quarter. We saw improvements in margins associated with people costs, as well as fleet costs. Material and supplies were neutral to margins, while insurance and claims were a headwind to margins. We delivered improvements in SG&A expense as well. SG&A improved 40 basis points when stated as a percentage of revenue during the most recent quarter. Let's dive into the major categories of SG&A a bit more. People costs, advertising and selling costs, and insurance and claims, make up a majority of our spend in SG&A. Margins benefited in the people cost area. Advertising and selling-related costs were relatively neutral to margins, while insurance and claims was a headwind to margins. As the case in the prior year, we expect to see SG&A tick up slightly in Q2 as we invest more heavily in customer acquisition-related costs across the business during the start of our more busy season in the second quarter. We do not have any non-GAAP adjustments to operating income or EBITDA this year. GAAP operating income was $112 million or 17.1% of revenue, increasing 130 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin was 21.2%, up a strong 130 basis points over the prior year EBITDA margin. As I have consistently indicated, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning, what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of approximately 32% in the most recent period. Quarterly GAAP net income was $88 million or $0.18 in an earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated $93 million of free cash flow on $88 million of earnings. Free cash flow increased by over 17% in the most recent period. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash, was also a bright spot, coming in and above 100% for the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling $15 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. Debt remains negligible, and debt to EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We closed and announced the Fox acquisition earlier in April. We are excited about the strategic growth opportunities this acquisition will provide us. A few financial details. We expect this acquisition to add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue in 2023. The acquisition should add $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA for the remainder of the year. We used a combination of existing cash balances and borrowings to pay for this strategic acquisition. We continue to be very active in pursuing additional acquisition opportunities. We expect the Fox acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first full year, with more meaningful contributions to EPS during the latter part of this year and into the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, and we'll provide an update on this on our Q2 call in July after we complete that process. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facilities that were set to expire in April of 2024. We closed on our new facility before the banking crisis in March, and we were able to successfully secure a more modernized facility, that, in addition to other benefits, provides us with the opportunity to incorporate sustainability metrics into the revolver in the future. Additionally, we conducted an RFP for our external audit service provider, and engaged Deloitte as our new auditor in place of Grant Thornton, who had been our auditor for the previous 19 years. We are making good progress on a number of general financial housekeeping issues that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. We remain very well positioned to continue to fund our dividend and grow through acquisitions. In summary, our quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust, and we are very well positioned to continue to use our strong balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is healthy, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. \nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We are happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Jerry, John, Ken, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask about the strategic rationale on Fox, but you guys did a great job about that in the prepared remarks. So, I think I'm going to skip that and just jump to the strong organic growth. The commercial pest business, that organic growth was basically double what we were expecting in the first quarter, and that's a significant margin of error, particularly for a predictable business like yours. So, is there anything you can highlight here? Large customer wins, new programs you've established, a pick-up in cross-selling, anything you can highlight as what contributed to that unexpected strength in that commercial piece?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Tim, this is Jerry. To me, it's pretty simple. It's about the investments we've made in hiring and staffing on the commercial side, the commercial front with our commercial account managers. We have a considerably larger staff than we did even a year ago and far more than we did two years ago. So, their efforts feed on the Street every single day. Bringing new business in at the volume they're bringing in, that's what's making the difference. It's not about individual wins or big customers or anything like that, it's the collective efforts of everything that they've done.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Sounds broad-based. Thank you. And then just switching gears from organic growth to capital allocation, I mean, now that you've already spent more than $300 million already in 2023, should we expect a slowdown in M&A spend for the remainder of the year? Or are we still going to see you acquire 30 to 40 bolt-ons that you normally do in a given year? And can you also discuss your plans for that leverage ratio? I mean, do you intend to drive it back to zero over the next several years like you typically do, or might we - are we potentially looking at a different capital structure at Rollins on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, so, Tim, this is Jerry. I'll handle the first part of that. We'll continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions, bolt-on acquisitions. We'll continue that path, and of course, continue to evaluate even larger acquisitions if they're there for us to get and the timing is right. But at the same time, we're also fairly cautious. We like to ensure that what we've - the most recent deal is handled well and our time and attention and focus is put on that to make sure that goes smoothly, that transition goes smoothly. We don't want to jump in anything with too much of a distraction for our team or for them in the short run. So, we're probably a little bit cautious there on really large deals in the very short term, but we'll continue to do the bolt-ons. And I'll let Ken address the question about capital. \nKen Krause: Sure. Just adding on to what Jerry had mentioned, the integration efforts are certainly really important to us. And so, we want to make sure that we integrate these businesses as much as we can, while not disrupting the customer-facing aspect of these businesses, which are so strong. From a debt to EBITDA perspective, Tim, I believe you were asking, when we look at our capital structure, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet. It does not mean that we're going to lever up two or three times to go after transformational acquisitions. We, quite frankly, don't need to. The business is so strong, but what we will do is use our balance sheet in a strategic manner to grow this business. And so, that's the focus. I can't commit to a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, but what I can tell you is, we will remain very much investment grade. We will very much remain to the playbook that we've executed for a very long time, which has certainly paid off for our investors.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question, Stephanie.\nHarold Antor: Good morning. This is Harold Antor on for Stephanie Moore. Last quarter, I know you reduced marketing spend for the quarter year-over-year. How did marketing spend track this quarter and how is it tracking for 2Q \u201823? Thank you.\nKen Krause: Thank you, Harold. I appreciate the question. This is Ken. I had mentioned in my prepared comments that advertising and marketing-related costs were relatively neutral to margins. So, that means that we were spending at just about the rate of growth of revenue in the first quarter. With that said, as we enter the second quarter, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in customer acquisition-related cost. And so, as we go into the second quarter, it's important for us to procure those new customers, which have an incredibly valuable long-term relationship with our business. As you know, approximately 80% of our business is recurring. And so, it's important for us to go after and get those new customers into the fold. And so, we'll continue to tick that up in the second quarter, as we have in past years. And so, I think that's an important point to remember as you think about modeling out, say, the second and third quarter of the year.\nHarold Antor: Thank you. That'll be all.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Paige from RBC. Please proceed with your question, David.\nDavid Paige: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I'm actually on for Ashish Sabadra at RBC. You mentioned Fox Pest Control, about one-third of the customers are acquired through digital channels. Do you have an outlook for the customer acquisition through digital channels post fully integrated Fox and maybe at HomeTeam, and then overall Rollins? Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I don't know that we've gotten that deep into the analysis. We want Fox to - we want to make for a smooth transition, have Fox settled into what they're doing. Certainly, they have - the team at Fox has had a - themselves gone through this transition over time, ramping up on the digital side. And we\u2019ll help them and continue to support their efforts to do that, give them some of our expertise and knowledge along the way to help them mature in that area and convert leads to sales and starts and those types of things that we feel like we can help them with over time. But at this point, I wouldn't give you any insight in terms of long-term what that may look like a year from now or two years from now. It\u2019s still premature\nKen Krause: What I would add to that, Jerry, is that Fox does a really exceptional job in their marketing efforts, and there might be an opportunity to leverage Fox and the Rollins family of brands. And so, I think that's really important to think about as you go forward. They do a really good job, and we certainly want to leverage all the work that they do across their business to benefit us through this combination.\nDavid Paige: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question, Seth.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually John filling in for Seth. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just maybe quickly on the insurance and claims, could you give us some more color on really kind of how the headwind progressed in the quarter, as well as how we should think about the cost going forward this year? Thanks.\nKen Krause: Certainly, can do that for you, and appreciate the comments. Insurance and claims has been a bit of a headwind here for a period of time, I believe going back to last year. In the third quarter, we talked about that. This year, when we look at the experience in insurance and claims, there's two aspects to that experience. One are just higher insurance premiums. As you know, we had poor experience last year. And so, unfortunately, we saw that come through with higher insurance premiums in the first quarter. That'll carry through for the remainder of the year. The second part of it is, we continue to see just some unfavorable experience in that area. We're ramping up our focus on behavioral-based safety across the company, and ensuring that we're making the right investments in the areas that'll help improve our performance in that area. But it's an area of focus for the company, and we continue to focus on driving some improvements. Unfortunately, we do feel the negative impact of a tighter insurance market, however.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's great color. Thank you. And maybe quickly, just as we think about the cadence of residential, especially with advertising and customer acquisition spend ramping in the second quarter for the kind of peak season, can you just give us a sense at a high level how you're thinking about the kind of pacing of residential? And would it be fair to assume we could kind of see an acceleration from these levels, or are you thinking more of a kind of steady-state, high single-digit on an organic basis? Thanks.\nKen Krause: It's hard to provide an estimate on that as we think about the next quarter or two. However, we feel like the investments we're making in our people, in our technicians and our sales folks, the focus we're making on cross-selling and driving cross-sell and a wider share of wallet with each and every individual customer, is paying off. And we feel very optimistic and bullish about our opportunity to continue to grow our position with our really important residential customers into the future.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, this is Jerry. I would add, we're in a really good position to take advantage of strong demand in the marketplace as it's there. So, we feel strong about our position to be able to capitalize on the potential for growth in the market, so.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The next question comes from Grant Slade from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question, Grant.\nGrant Slade: Hi, Jerry. Hi, Ken. Thank you both very much for the additional detail on the Fox acquisition. It's very helpful. Just a point of clarification, however, if I may. I was just curious, the $18 million to $22 million in EBITDA contribution for this year, does that include the full extent of cost synergies that you're expecting to realize from the deal? Or are there perhaps further synergies we should be expecting in 2024 or later? And I guess if so, the quantum of those and the timing would be helpful, if you're able to share that detail with us.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, thank you for the question. We feel like that's - when we think about synergies and we think about integration as we started the call, we certainly are taking a pragmatic approach with respect to synergies and synergy capture. We do think that this business will be accretive to our margins in the next two to three years. But the first year is all about getting in and trying to understand what makes the business so valuable. We don't want to move too quickly, but we also don't want to move too slowly. But we do feel like that $18 million to $22 million is our best expectation or estimate of what we can deliver on the acquisition this year.\nGrant Slade: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Aadit Shrestha from Stifel. Please proceed with your question, Aadit.\nAadit Shrestha: Hi, good morning. This is Aadit from Stifel. Thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on the strong quarter. So, my first question is just really the Fox Pest acquisition. How should the annual $90 million to $ 100 million in sales, how should that be allocated across the lines of businesses? And what are the drivers that would get you to $100 million versus that low end of $90 million? What are you actually building in?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Why don't you handle this, Ken? \nKen Krause: Sure. Yes. And so, when we look at that business, the breakdown is highly focused on residential. A large percentage of that business is resi sector. And so, that'll come through our residential segment of our business. We feel like that $90 million to $100 million would probably come into our business very similarly to how our business is reported. So, Q2, you'll see a ramping from Q1, and then Q3 you'll see a further ramping. That's just the seasonality of our business. We feel like there's opportunities to drive some outsized growth there, but I also feel like this $90 million to $100 million is a very realistic estimate, and is reflective of the growth trajectory, strong growth trajectory that the business is already on. And so, we feel like it's very realistic in achieving that $90 million to $100 million this year as we think about the remainder of the year.\nJohn Wilson: Ken, if I may add, this is John Wilson, but if I may add, retention is critical. And so, that's why with these acquisitions, we don't go into looking to rock their world and go so carefully on the integration and/or assimilation. But Fox continuing their current path on the way they retain their customers and retain their employees, which is important to keep in those customers, will determine whether we get to the $100 million versus the $90 million.\nAadit Shrestha: All right. Thank you for that. And I have a follow-up regarding incremental margins, pretty healthy, 32%. How should we think about it for the remain of the year? Can you maybe exceed that 32% with sort of the pricing actions and the cost-cutting initiatives that you've put in? Plus like, what's the impact of Fox Pest on that?\nKen Krause: Certainly. Thanks for the question. If you look at the last nine months, the last three quarters, if you will, going back to the second half of last year, we've consistently delivered an incremental margin that's approaching 30%. So, we feel like we're positioned very well to deliver that 30% sort of incremental margin as we move forward. There's always challenges. There\u2019s always puts, and there's takes, and there might be one quarter where you might be below that, but you might have one quarter where you exceed that. As I said in my prepared comments, the second quarter, you're going to see a little bit more investment in customer acquisition costs. We see an opportunity to go after and get customers that are going to create long-term value for our business. And so, you'll probably see a little bit more investment, a little heavier investment come through in that area as we think about the second quarter, but we feel very good about long-term value creation from those customers that will help us deliver that incremental margin profile of 30 plus percent.\nOperator: Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We look forward to giving you an update at the end of the second quarter on our next call. We'll see you then. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you very much for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining our call today. Our partnership with Fox was an 18-month process. As we worked on executing this transaction and learned more about the Fox business, we became increasingly impressed with their culture, their consistent and strong growth rates, and their unique operating model. In early April, I had the opportunity to visit with many of the fantastic team members at Fox, and was able to witness firsthand the deep pride they have in the Fox brand. Additionally, as Ken will cover in more detail later, we believe the financial benefits are very compelling. We expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first full year of ownership, and will provide meaningful long-term financial benefits as well. We also believe the complementary nature of their brand creates opportunities for enhancing Rollins's strategic platform for growth in the residential space. While still operating under the Fox Pest Control brand and being led by co-founders Mike Romney, and Bryant White, we see incredible potential for the teams at Fox and HomeTeam to learn and share with one another. There are multiple benefits to tying Fox closely with HomeTeam, who have also been utilizing door-to-door campaigns to activate Taexx customers in their predominantly residential business for over 20 years. Furthermore, this alliance will provide HomeTeam with an ability to scale markets faster while we provide the team at Fox with new service offerings and cross-sell opportunities along the way. We're also particularly excited about the strong alignment of their culture and the value the partnership creates for customers, team members, and to our shareholders. Fox has a passionate sense of community and a values-driven approach that consistently delivers quality service, coupled with the resilient track record of strong customer growth and solid employee retention. As we've demonstrated in the past, acquisitions are a key part of Rollins's growth strategy. Over the years, we've built a very successful playbook for their smooth transitions into our company, and we are extremely excited about our path ahead with Fox. In summary, we are confident that Fox's business perfectly aligns to our strategy for sustainable profitable growth, and I'm incredibly proud to add them to our impressive family of pest control brands.  Transitioning to our recent financial performance, I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered solid first quarter results and realized strong year-over-year growth in many key performance areas. Ken will address the financials in more detail in a moment, but I'd like to highlight three key areas of progress in the quarter. First, we delivered 11% revenue growth. What was especially encouraging was our organic growth. Organic growth was more than 9% for the quarter, with strong growth across all major service lines. Secondly, margins were very healthy to start the year. We delivered approximately 32% incremental margins and grew GAAP earnings per share 20%. The focus on pricing, selling new business, and productivity is paying off. On our year-end call, we discussed our intention to initiate an earlier price increase this year, and that certainly helped us, particularly in March. We'll continue to focus on this area to ensure that we are effectively pricing the value of our essential services. And last, but not least, we reported strong growth and cash flow for the quarter. We remain well positioned to continue to invest in acquisitions, and maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. As we move into spring and summer months, we expect a good business environment and strong demand for our services when you consider recent weather patterns resulting in wet outdoor conditions. April is off to a favorable start, and our teams in the field are well staffed and trained as we head into our traditional peak season. We're also continuing to add to our sales force and emphasizing bundling of multiple services like pest and mosquito through our call center operations. I want to emphasize how pleased we are with Rollins's strong first quarter performance. And looking ahead, we remain well positioned for 2023 and confident in our ability to continue to drive strong operating results.  I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Ken. We are happy to take any questions at this time. Tim, this is Jerry. To me, it's pretty simple.

            "content": "Yes, thank you Joe, and good morning. We appreciate all of you joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm pleased to report, Rollins delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by revenue growth of over 11%, and earnings per share growth of 20%. I want to begin by welcoming P. Russell Hardin as Rollins newest board member. Russ was elected to our Board at our recent shareholder meeting, and has served as President of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation since 2006. He serves as a Director of Genuine Parts Company, as well as a trustee of the Northwestern Mutual Company. Hardin practiced law with the firm of King & Spalding, and as a long-time resident of Atlanta, has served this community in ways too numerous to list. Please help me welcome Russ Hardin.  Now turning to the Fox Pest Control acquisition, I'm very excited about this recent event. Enjoying a strong reputation in the marketplace, we have long respected Fox's history of success. In fact, I have a relationship with one of their founders, Mike Romney, going back close to 20 years, as Mike began doing summer sales programs for Orkin prior to co-founding Fox. Fox Pest Control was formally established in 2012, initially marketing through the door-to-door sales effort in historically underserved pest control markets. Through consistent growth and expansion, Fox now provides general pest control services for homeowners from 32 locations in 13 States. Fox evolved in their growth strategies to include other streams, as now about a third of their customers are acquired through digital channels. Not only does Fox rank as the 13th largest pest management company, according to the PCT 100 rankings, Fox also received recognition in 2021 by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing private companies in America. In many of the markets they serve, Fox is a market leader with a great service reputation. I cannot stress enough what a great addition this is to our family of brands, and I'll now hand the call over to Jerry to recap Rollin's first quarter results, and talk about the transaction in greater detail. Ken, if I may add, this is John Wilson, but if I may add, retention is critical. And so, that's why with these acquisitions, we don't go into looking to rock their world and go so carefully on the integration and/or assimilation.

            "name": "Ken Krause",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The team delivered a strong start to the year. Let me begin with a few financial highlights for the first quarter of 2023. First, we delivered over 11% revenue growth in the first quarter, with robust growth across all our service offerings. Acquisitions drove approximately 2% of the total revenue growth in the quarter. We expect to see meaningful improvement in growth from acquisitions for the remainder of the year, stemming from the acquisition of Fox we announced earlier this month. Second, our continued emphasis on margin improvements drove 130 basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins in the quarter. I will speak about incremental margins shortly, but as Jerry indicated, they were a bright spot. GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.18 per share. And last, but not least, we delivered a 15% improvement in operating cash flow, and a 17% improvement in free cash flow. Let's look at the quarterly results in more detail. Starting off with revenue, it was $658 million, up just over 11% on a reported basis. Currencies reduced quarterly revenue growth by 60 basis points on the stronger dollar, notably versus the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the Australian dollar.  Turning to profitability, we realized 30 basis points improvement in gross profit margin. Gross profit margins were 50.3% of revenue in the quarter. We saw good performance on gross profit, as pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. We were more consistent in raising prices across all of our brands this year. We discussed our intent to do this on our year-end call, and it was good to see the impact of the steps we took on revenue and profitability. Looking at four major buckets of costs, people, fleet, materials and supplies, and insurance and claims. These comprise approximately 90% of cost of services in the quarter. We saw improvements in margins associated with people costs, as well as fleet costs. Material and supplies were neutral to margins, while insurance and claims were a headwind to margins. We delivered improvements in SG&A expense as well. SG&A improved 40 basis points when stated as a percentage of revenue during the most recent quarter. Let's dive into the major categories of SG&A a bit more. People costs, advertising and selling costs, and insurance and claims, make up a majority of our spend in SG&A. Margins benefited in the people cost area. Advertising and selling-related costs were relatively neutral to margins, while insurance and claims was a headwind to margins. As the case in the prior year, we expect to see SG&A tick up slightly in Q2 as we invest more heavily in customer acquisition-related costs across the business during the start of our more busy season in the second quarter. We do not have any non-GAAP adjustments to operating income or EBITDA this year. GAAP operating income was $112 million or 17.1% of revenue, increasing 130 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin was 21.2%, up a strong 130 basis points over the prior year EBITDA margin. As I have consistently indicated, I like to look at the business using incremental margins or meaning, what percent of every additional dollar of revenue growth is converted to EBITDA. On an as-reported basis, we generated incremental margins of approximately 32% in the most recent period. Quarterly GAAP net income was $88 million or $0.18 in an earnings per share, increasing from $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, quarterly free cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We generated $93 million of free cash flow on $88 million of earnings. Free cash flow increased by over 17% in the most recent period. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was turned into cash, was also a bright spot, coming in and above 100% for the quarter. We made acquisitions totaling $15 million, and we paid $64 million in dividends. Debt remains negligible, and debt to EBITDA is well below 1x on a gross level. We closed and announced the Fox acquisition earlier in April. We are excited about the strategic growth opportunities this acquisition will provide us. A few financial details. We expect this acquisition to add between $90 million and $100 million of revenue in 2023. The acquisition should add $18 million to $22 million of EBITDA for the remainder of the year. We used a combination of existing cash balances and borrowings to pay for this strategic acquisition. We continue to be very active in pursuing additional acquisition opportunities. We expect the Fox acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first full year, with more meaningful contributions to EPS during the latter part of this year and into the first quarter of next year. We are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, and we'll provide an update on this on our Q2 call in July after we complete that process. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facilities that were set to expire in April of 2024. We closed on our new facility before the banking crisis in March, and we were able to successfully secure a more modernized facility, that, in addition to other benefits, provides us with the opportunity to incorporate sustainability metrics into the revolver in the future. Additionally, we conducted an RFP for our external audit service provider, and engaged Deloitte as our new auditor in place of Grant Thornton, who had been our auditor for the previous 19 years. We are making good progress on a number of general financial housekeeping issues that will help position us best as we continue to grow our business. We remain very well positioned to continue to fund our dividend and grow through acquisitions. In summary, our quarter performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth through acquisition. Organic demand remains robust, and we are very well positioned to continue to use our strong balance sheet to grow our business. The acquisition pipeline is healthy, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet positions us well to invest in our business. We continue to focus on execution and driving long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Sure. Just adding on to what Jerry had mentioned, the integration efforts are certainly really important to us. And so, we want to make sure that we integrate these businesses as much as we can, while not disrupting the customer-facing aspect of these businesses, which are so strong. From a debt to EBITDA perspective, Tim, I believe you were asking, when we look at our capital structure, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet. It does not mean that we're going to lever up two or three times to go after transformational acquisitions. We, quite frankly, don't need to. The business is so strong, but what we will do is use our balance sheet in a strategic manner to grow this business. And so, that's the focus. I can't commit to a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, but what I can tell you is, we will remain very much investment grade. We will very much remain to the playbook that we've executed for a very long time, which has certainly paid off for our investors. Thank you, Harold. I appreciate the question. This is Ken. I had mentioned in my prepared comments that advertising and marketing-related costs were relatively neutral to margins. So, that means that we were spending at just about the rate of growth of revenue in the first quarter. With that said, as we enter the second quarter, we are continuing to ramp up our investment in customer acquisition-related cost. And so, as we go into the second quarter, it's important for us to procure those new customers, which have an incredibly valuable long-term relationship with our business. As you know, approximately 80% of our business is recurring. And so, it's important for us to go after and get those new customers into the fold. And so, we'll continue to tick that up in the second quarter, as we have in past years. And so, I think that's an important point to remember as you think about modeling out, say, the second and third quarter of the year. What I would add to that, Jerry, is that Fox does a really exceptional job in their marketing efforts, and there might be an opportunity to leverage Fox and the Rollins family of brands. And so, I think that's really important to think about as you go forward. They do a really good job, and we certainly want to leverage all the work that they do across their business to benefit us through this combination. Certainly, can do that for you, and appreciate the comments. Insurance and claims has been a bit of a headwind here for a period of time, I believe going back to last year. In the third quarter, we talked about that. This year, when we look at the experience in insurance and claims, there's two aspects to that experience. One are just higher insurance premiums. As you know, we had poor experience last year. And so, unfortunately, we saw that come through with higher insurance premiums in the first quarter. That'll carry through for the remainder of the year. The second part of it is, we continue to see just some unfavorable experience in that area. We're ramping up our focus on behavioral-based safety across the company, and ensuring that we're making the right investments in the areas that'll help improve our performance in that area. But it's an area of focus for the company, and we continue to focus on driving some improvements. Unfortunately, we do feel the negative impact of a tighter insurance market, however. It's hard to provide an estimate on that as we think about the next quarter or two. However, we feel like the investments we're making in our people, in our technicians and our sales folks, the focus we're making on cross-selling and driving cross-sell and a wider share of wallet with each and every individual customer, is paying off. And we feel very optimistic and bullish about our opportunity to continue to grow our position with our really important residential customers into the future. Sure. Yes. And so, when we look at that business, the breakdown is highly focused on residential. A large percentage of that business is resi sector. And so, that'll come through our residential segment of our business. We feel like that $90 million to $100 million would probably come into our business very similarly to how our business is reported. So, Q2, you'll see a ramping from Q1, and then Q3 you'll see a further ramping. That's just the seasonality of our business. We feel like there's opportunities to drive some outsized growth there, but I also feel like this $90 million to $100 million is a very realistic estimate, and is reflective of the growth trajectory, strong growth trajectory that the business is already on. And so, we feel like it's very realistic in achieving that $90 million to $100 million this year as we think about the remainder of the year. Certainly. Thanks for the question. If you look at the last nine months, the last three quarters, if you will, going back to the second half of last year, we've consistently delivered an incremental margin that's approaching 30%. So, we feel like we're positioned very well to deliver that 30% sort of incremental margin as we move forward. There's always challenges. There's always puts, and there's takes, and there might be one quarter where you might be below that, but you might have one quarter where you exceed that. As I said in my prepared comments, the second quarter, you're going to see a little bit more investment in customer acquisition costs. We see an opportunity to go after and get customers that are going to create long-term value for our business. And so, you'll probably see a little bit more investment, a little heavier investment come through in that area as we think about the second quarter, but we feel very good about long-term value creation from those customers that will help us deliver that incremental margin profile of 30 plus percent."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nLyndsey Burton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Management will make some opening remarks and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. We would like to begin our discussion today by offering our support and encouragement to all of those who have been impacted by the recent hurricanes. I'm proud of the way our team has worked together to support our teammates and the communities we serve in the aftermath of these disasters. The Rollins\u2019 relief fund has processed over 250 emergency grants for teammates in need. And we continue to direct truckloads of food, water and other necessities to impacted areas. Our efforts will continue in the days, weeks and months ahead as these communities begin to recover. Turning to our financial results, our team delivered another solid quarter, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our team delivered these results despite some operational disruption caused by Hurricane Helene, which occurred during the last week of the quarter. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 9% to $916 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines. We continue to invest in growing our business and adding to our customer base, as the markets we serve remain strong. We invested significantly in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities in Q3 and we're well staffed to convert quality leads and sales efforts into new customer growth, which our results in the quarter reflect. On the commercial side of the business, we continue to make long-term investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities in a multi-billion dollar B2B market. Our commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 32 tuck-in deals in the first nine months of the year and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Tim will discuss in more detail, but investments we made to support long-term growth objectives did temper margins a bit in the quarter. But we remain on track to deliver healthy margin improvement and profitability for the year. In yesterday's release, we also announced a planned leadership transition at our board of directors. In accordance with the company's long-term leadership succession plan, Gary Rollins will transition from Executive Chairman to Executive Chairman Emeritus and John Wilson will succeed him as Executive Chairman of the Board. Gary was elected to a three-year term during our 2024 annual meeting and will continue to be an active and engaged member of our board. John has been with our company since 1996 in various positions of increasing responsibility. I've known John for 20 years and his experience and guidance have been invaluable to me as I have transitioned to the role of CEO over the last two years. I look forward to continuing to work with John, Gary and the rest of our Board as we position our company for continued success in the future. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKenneth Krause: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. We are now nine months into 2024 and we've delivered solid financial results. Year-to-date, we've delivered double-digit improvement across all major P&L metrics year-over-year and EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points, despite making significant investments in the business here in Q3. Cash flow continues to be strong, with free cash flow growing nearly 12% year-to-date, enabling a 10% increase to our dividend which we announced earlier this week. With this increase, we have raised our regular dividend by approximately 65% since the beginning of 2022, while continuing to meaningfully invest in the growth of our business. This is a reflection of our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our future. Looking closer at the third quarter, our team executed exceptionally well and delivered Q3 revenue growth of 9% year-over-year, with organic growth of 7.7% at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we've discussed this year. We delivered good growth across each of our service offerings. In the third quarter, residential revenues increased 6.4%, commercial pest control rose 9.4%, and termite and ancillary increased by 14.5%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio with growth of 4.9% in residential, 8.1% in commercial and 13.7% in the termite and ancillary area of our business. Turning to profitability, our gross margins were 54%, up 20 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. Pressures from incremental people investments were offset by leverage in materials and supplies as well as fleet. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue increased by 100 basis points versus last year. This was primarily driven by incremental investments in people to support our growth initiatives and the uptick in advertising spend that we expected and previously discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $192 million, up 8.3% year-over-year. Operating margins were 20.9%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $219 million, up over 5% and representing a 24% margin. Margins were down 80 basis points versus last year. And adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were 15.1% in the quarter, reflecting incremental investments in people and growth programs during the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter, and we continue to expect an ETR of approximately 26% for the year, which implies a rate that is just over 27% for the fourth quarter. Quarterly GAAP net income was $137 million or $0.28 per share, increasing 7.7% from $0.26 per share in the same period a year ago. Accounting for certain non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $140 million or $0.29 per share, increasing nearly 4% from the same period a year ago, despite a higher level of interest costs and the investments we are making in growth oriented initiatives. We remain on track to deliver healthy profitability for the full year, driven by solid growth and an improving margin profile. We continue to focus on driving further improvements, while investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly cash flow was $139 million, up a very healthy 16% versus last year. Free cash flow conversion was 102% for the quarter and 110% year-to-date. We made acquisitions totaling $24 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions of $106 million and returned $218 million to shareholders through our dividend. Additionally, we had just announced a 10% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This represents over two decades of consecutive increases in annual dividend payments. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-time on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are well positioned and committed to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. In closing, we continue to focus on investing for growth, while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the last quarter of the year with healthy organic demand and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: So residential organic, I wanted to ask about that. It's I guess, 5% year-to-date, still indicative of a healthy market. I recognize that, but maybe slightly below what we've seen over the last several years. So I'm just curious, how would you characterize the health of the consumer today? And could you maybe break that growth down between your recurring revenue stream and one-time sales?\nKenneth Krause: We appreciate that. When we dive in and we look at the overall growth of the business, we continue to remain very optimistic, very confident in our outlook. We talked about 7% to 8%. We delivered 7.7% here in the quarter and 7.7% organic growth year-to-date. When you look closer at the residential business, it's an area that we're also pretty pleased with the performance, especially when we look at the recurring revenue in the business. Back in September, we spoke on a public webcast and talked about the fact that we were seeing 6% plus recurring revenue growth coming through the residential sector. And that's where we finished. That's where we've been for the better part of the year. And so, we're pretty pleased with that level of recurring revenue growth, especially in the residential sector. When I look at the business in the quarter, Jerry pointed out the fact that, unfortunately, we all had to deal with the effects of the hurricane late in the quarter. But if you set that aside and you look at what happened as a result of that hurricane, it probably had about a $2 million or so impact on revenue growth. And so we would have probably delivered organic growth that would have been slightly higher than the 7.7%, closer to the high end, the 8% that we have talked about in the business. So overall, we remain very pleased with the performance. The team is doing an exceptional job at delivering yet another quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff : And the health of the residential consumer does appear still strong to us. We see good growth in termite and ancillary, a good acceptance of our cross-sell campaigns and other things. So if there's anything that's been more inconsistent, it's the onetime piece. And the residential recurring, that's what we're really investing in with marketing, trying to drive quality leads. That's what we invest in with door-to-door and any other type of channel that we go to is to try to create recurring revenue streams. And the investments we made in the third quarter will pay off for us in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year as our customer base is bigger as we head into the back end of the year.\nTim Mulrooney : That's a lot of helpful color. I'm just going to switch gears really quickly because, Ken, I think I remember having a conversation with you a couple of months ago about really like when you're looking at incremental margins, you're really trying to hit that in that target range, not any particular quarter but more, like, if you look at it on an LTM basis, right? So that's kind of how we're analyzing the business, thinking about it from that standpoint. So I guess my question is, if we look at incremental margins on an LTM basis, do you expect them to be essentially in line with your target range for the full year this year? Or might that be different given the incremental investments?\nKenneth Krause: We continue to remain confident in our outlook on incremental margins. With a business that's generating gross margins of 54%, we feel like the contribution or the incremental margins should be approximating that 30% level. And in fact, when you look at the quarter and you peel back the performance, you unpack the performance a little bit and look at it a little bit closer, what you see is that we spent more in selling and marketing. We saw an opportunity in a very attractive growth market to invest and grow our businesses, and just alluding to what Jerry just spoke about. So we spent a little bit more there. If you set that aside, along with some of the investments we made on the tech side to accelerate the start rate that we have in our business, you'd see an incremental margin that would be right around 30% here in the quarter. So we continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver 30% plus incremental margins longer term.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes, this quarter is more of a timing issue more than anything as we indicated at the end of Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : I also wanted to ask about margin. You mentioned the growth investments in hiring more people. Should we expect further investment in future quarters? Or was this more of a catch up to where you want to be? And just if you could talk about which segments you're investing in and most of that would be the best.\nKenneth Krause: Sure. When we look at the investments, this is a growth business. It's a growth market. We continue to see great growth opportunities. So we're going to continue to invest in the business. When I go back and unpack the investments we made this quarter, I would look at them through two or three lenses. One is on our service side and our service technicians. Because we know the importance of getting out and starting our lead -- getting our leads converted into starts, we have certainly invested in the service side of our business. That's probably about a 30 basis point headwind on gross margins in the quarter. The second area that we made investments here is in our sales and our sales engine and our sales people. We've talked about the fact that our commercial business remains a very important area of our business combined with our residential. And so, we're investing disproportionately in the sales end of our business and you saw that come through along with the increased advertising spend that we had here in the quarter to the tune of about 100 basis points. So you probably don't expect that level of investment every single quarter, but you're going to see us invest in this business following the various strategic initiatives that we talked about back at our Investor Day back in May.\nJerry Gahlhoff : And to add a little color to that when I look back at Q3 of 2023 compared to 2024 on our staffing levels, just thinking -- just peeling back, just working itself. You think on the commercial side, we are looking at the data to say, hey, where do we have adequate coverage given the market and we're going to continue to invest where that opportunity is there. If it gets difficult to scale or the data sets that we've got good penetrated -- the penetration that we need and we have the right people in the right places for where the opportunities are that will certainly slow down. But we'll let the data and then how we're doing operationally from a scalability standpoint will help us dictate that. And then on the residential side, selling termite, cross-sell, ancillary business, those kinds of things that staffing is up double-digits just like the commercial side is as we continue to make those investments there. And the opportunities there, the consumer is taking the services and buying the services, as you see in our results. And we find that to be a very worthwhile investment and we'll continue to do that so long as the market holds it.\nToni Kaplan : And I wanted to ask about pricing as we approach the end of the year and thinking about your strategy into next year. I think we've been in a little bit of a unique environment in the last couple of years in terms of we had the inflation and then it's been cooling. So I know we've been a little bit on the higher side on price in the past couple of years. Do you see that sort of higher-than-normal price level of increases continuing into 2025 when you're looking at your data and stuff like that? Just how are you thinking about it?\nJerry Gahlhoff : So Ken and I just recently spent hours in a room together reviewing those data from our price increase results this year, and there's not been anything in there that -- in the data from what we see and what we understand about the consumer that scares us off of continuing to get a fair price for our service. And if we're doing a good job, we should reward -- be rewarded for that, and our technicians in the field should be rewarded for that as well. So we've not seen anything in the data that would cause us to change course from anything that we've already indicated to you.\nKenneth Krause: Both internally but also externally. When you look at CPI, we've consistently talked about CPI plus level of pricing. And CPI coming back roughly 2.5% recently gives us no reason to step back on the pricing and pare that back. We feel like this is an essential service and we should be able to be rewarded. And we should be able to reward our service technicians with the pricing that we've seen in the last couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst : This is [Aude Ashkar] on for Jason Hass. I wanted to ask on the commercial side. Just any update there in terms of the strategy around splitting the brands and adding to the sales force? I think there's eventual plans to create a second division. And can you just remind us there of the margin opportunity being able to capitalize on multiple branches across a single digital media channel?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We still continue to have a pretty long runway on the commercial side and how we structure that business, how we open new branches. And to your point about opening another division, those types of things, we're still in -- probably in the first two or three innings of what's possible there on the commercial side, and we're going to continue to invest in those opportunities. And even from a margin standpoint, the commercial side tends to drive some stickier customer base and just -- and a very appealing margin opportunity there as well on that side of the business. So we see nothing but good things from the future on that commercial strategy. And we're just, like I said, still in the early stages.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just if you can maybe talk about the trends you're seeing in commercial between the national accounts and the SMEs. And just wondering of your guys take on advertising for SMEs relative to the resi side of the business, maybe differences or similarities that you would call out there?\nJerry Gahlhoff : I don't think there's been anything -- any sort of significant shift in that space how -- from a competitive standpoint. I think we've been making a more conservative effort, especially within the Orkin brand to focus on the commercial side and our marketing strategy there. And we've allocated more dollars into the commercial space ourselves to do that. But I don't think there's been any significant shift in the competitive environment or anything along those lines from an advertising standpoint or a go-to-market strategy that we've seen.\nKenneth Krause : The team continues to do well. Scott Weaver is heading up our business in Orkin in the commercial side and we're seeing nice results there. But also I was just talking to our business leader, Rob Quinn yesterday up in Canada, and he's talking about the good performance we're seeing coming out of our Canadian commercial business.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Mostly a commercial business.\nKenneth Krause: Substantially all commercial. And so really good results across both of those markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Paige : This is David Paige on for Ashish. Congrats on the good results. A question on termite and ancillary or just other maybe untapped potential in the residential space that you -- I guess, that the company is looking to capitalize outside of the current operators that you have.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We're always looking for new services and new opportunities in and around the home that we can maybe expand to. And some of those are geographic in nature based on construction type of the house or certain types of pests and things like that. So there haven't been anything -- there's nothing revolutionary that we've seen other than the continuation of adding more sales staff to increase the number of customers with more than one service for us. And that's why we continue to be so successful adding our home sales inspectors to offer those types of ancillary services. And another great opportunity is selling more recurring termite. We have a lot of customers that have pest control that don't have termite control that we can continue to offer that service to through cross-marketing, cross-selling campaigns. So we're pretty good at sticking to what works. There's so much opportunity there and we're just continuing to invest and drive that part of the business.\nDavid Paige : And just a follow-up on in terms of inorganic investment, given the robust free cash generation, the low debt leverage. Anything we should keep in mind for there in terms of verticals or geographies that you'd be targeting?\nKenneth Krause : No, nothing noteworthy there other than we're going to continue to deploy capital and M&A. We continue to have a focus on delivering 2% to 3% of revenue growth from M&A each year. Markets remain very healthy, an incredibly attractive market, so you certainly do have competition from time to time. But we've been able to separate ourselves by how we treat the acquisitions that we bring into the fold and how we treat the teams and the brands. And that's a meaningful difference for us in our markets. But in terms of new markets, we see so much opportunity. It's such a fragmented, such a large and growing market, the pest control market that we're going to continue to remain committed to that area.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong : You mentioned seeing disruptions to operations from Hurricane Helene during the last week of the quarter. Can you discuss which parts of the business this impacted the most and whether you expect any spillover effect in 4Q?\nJerry Gahlhoff : So it was really the -- obviously, the Southeast United States, the coastal areas of Florida where we have a strong presence, both in the Orkin brands as well as brands like HomeTeam in Northwest, all up the West Coast of Florida and parts of the East Coast of Florida too as that storm had pushed through and had tornadoes in the southeast and central part of the Eastern Coast of Florida. So there was a lot going on there. We had a lot of branch closures for several days. We focus on making sure we are prepared for the storms as they're coming and letting our people prepare. We know that the more people prepare, the faster we can respond and get back to work if people are in a good place themselves. So we had a lot of branch closures for several days. We got back up on our feet after Helene. And then Wham, you get another one that caused significantly more challenges. Talking to our people in the field, number one, it happened very early in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. So it gives us plenty of time to respond and recover. I'm sure there will be some customer losses along the coastal -- the immediate coast. But I don't think that's anything too severe that we can't recover from. We've looked at our forecast for October and the future and there's really nothing there, Ken that we've seen in the Southeast U.S. that gives us a lot of pause about the fourth quarter, is there?\nKenneth Krause : No, not the outlook. Not really impacting the outlook all that much. But the quarter, you look at Southeast, it was probably one of the slower growing regions in the quarter because of the hurricane impact late in the quarter. To the earlier question we had on the call, I do think that if we did not have the impact of that hurricane the last couple of days, we probably would have seen organic growth even stronger coming through as opposed to the 7.7%. So it did impact us. But as we think about the outlook, we feel like, as Jerry said, we have enough time here left in this quarter to make up for what we had in October.\nGeorge Tong : And then as it relates to your growth investments, can you elaborate on what you saw this quarter that prompted you to step up the spend? How would you assess the possibility that growth investments will remain elevated at 3Q levels going forward if market conditions support it?\nKenneth Krause : I think the thing that gave us the most hope was the fact that we were seeing 8% organic growth coming through. Leads were strong. Market was very healthy. So we continue to see that, and it's provided Jerry and I and the business leaders, Pat and Stanford, the level of confidence to invest. And it's not that we're investing in every single one of our brands at the same pace, but we did certainly were able to identify certain areas and make more significant investments in certain areas. And so that's really what came through. As far as the outlook and next steps go, yes, we're going to -- we can't say what pace we're going to invest in at this point, but we certainly are going to continue to invest. We firmly believe this is a growth market. This is a growth opportunity. And in order to be most successful, we've got to invest in our people and capturing additional customers.\nJerry Gahlhoff : And I think part of the algorithm is that you want to acquire customers in the second and third quarter, build your base. Because the phones aren't ringing near as much in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as they do in peak season. So in Q2, Q3 is where you grow your recurring customer base and that's your bread and butter as you go into the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2025, is having a significantly higher customer base in which to serve. That -- and so that makes me very comfortable with the outlook knowing the customer base is healthy and strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aadit Shrestha with Stifel.\nAadit Shrestha : Just going back to sort of the price. How did price cost spread trend in 3Q '24 versus, let's say, 2Q '24? And on a recurring basis, what sort of margin expansion would you expect from just that spread alone? And would you expect a similar trend in FY'25?\nKenneth Krause : Hard to say what 2025 will be at this point just yet in terms of margin opportunity and spread. But when you're getting 3% to 4% price increase in this business, you should see margins improve. If I look at the quarter and I unpacked the quarter, we had 20 basis points of improvement in gross margin. But we invested 30 basis points in our service area. So when you set that aside, you had about 50 basis points of leverage coming through in the quarter in gross margin. It was good to see. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to deliver that pace of improvement going forward. But you know as well as I do that from a quarter-to-quarter basis, things can shift.\nAadit Shrestha : And just a follow-up. Commercial growth has been pretty strong because of the investments you've been making. And do you see this sort of as high single-digits growth -- organic growth in 2025 as well, just because of what you've done already. And the sales and sort of ad spend that you've been investing into that business?\nKenneth Krause : I think to answer that question, we would look at what we communicated at Investor Day back in May. And really our plan and our hope is to see commercial business grow at a faster rate than our overall business. You might see resi a little bit slower from time to time, but your overall commercial business should be accretive to the overall organic growth profile of the business as we think about the near-term and the investments we're making.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst : [Jerry Kanlindsey] here. In terms of your decision to hire people at this juncture of the year, could you just talk about the timing? Were you trying to address a little bit of a shortage? Or are you trying to get people time to ramp up for next season? Just maybe unpack the timing of the hiring that would be great.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So I don't -- when you think about from a sales staffing, are you talking more on the sales staffing or the technician front?\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes. It sounds like you invested in both, so would be curious your thoughts on kind of hiring people in the third quarter as opposed to maybe in the spring, something like that.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. So if you have the right amount of growth and you have route splits and branch openings and things like that, that were -- and you're trying to maintain the right balance of the number of customers on, say, a service technician's route, things like that, we'll always add. And usually, that's that could occur toward -- more towards the end of season, in the third quarter where we do route splits and things along those lines. And that's the right time to add those customers -- or add those technicians. On the sales side, we have over the last several years taken and hired really year-round and continuing to. What we're cognizant of is one of the things I mentioned, is like how fast can you scale, how fast can you train the right amount. So we're trying to take a balanced approach rather than hiring a bunch of onetime a year, trying to train. Let's say, it's easier to train 20 people in a class that you have four, five classes a year and you're adding 100 than it is to try to add 60 in a quarter and ramp it up and because your success rate of hiring 60 versus hiring 20 and putting the time and attention to them in that you need is a little more challenging. So we've taken a more balanced approach to how we onboard and how we time those hires and add strategically over time. And that means we will be making hires throughout the year. I will say generally speaking, though, when we get into the fourth quarter, we do tend to -- especially on home sales inspectors on the residential side, there's a lot less of that hiring. It will usually begin again in the January, February timeframe before we head in the season. While on the commercial side, it's a little bit more of a year-round type of event.\nKenneth Krause: It's interesting you say that and you finish with that, Jerry, because if you just look at the quarter, what we saw was we gained leverage in those areas in September. And so more of our significant -- more significant investments were made in July and August. We didn't see as much investment coming through in September as you did earlier in the third quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff : That's a good point, Ken, because a lot of that in the quarter was very front-end loaded in the early part of Q3. And then we kind of wind it down, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst : And then on the advertising spending, do you track kind of the returns on advertising? Some returns metric related to advertising spend? And could you talk about whether those metrics have kind of changed over the last, call it, 6 to 12 months or so?\nJerry Gahlhoff : Yes. We do measure return on ad spend or roll off. That's a key metric. And that's what makes the -- and particular in the digital channel, so dynamic and where if you look at Q2, when we spent a little less. You're looking at the market, you're looking at the cost to drive the leads in the digital space and you're making adjustments. You may decide to hold off. You may have -- maybe there's some local regional competitors doing some things, and you just say, hey, I'm going to back off for a little while and wait for this to settle down. And then we're going to -- and then you're going to invest a little bit more a little later in the season and into the third quarter where you can drive lower cost of customer acquisition on a better return on your ad spend. So we're always looking at that. And we have been able to manage those costs pretty well to that point too of -- well, again, I know we've said this like a broken record, but we're still going to continue to be disciplined in our advertising spend such that as a percent of revenue, say, on the Orkin brand, they're going to spend as a percent of revenue a very similar amount as a percent of revenue that we have been committed to for years that amount. So it's a little more in dollars year-to-year as the business grows. But in order to do that, we've got to do -- we've always got to strive to do more with those dollars, acquire customers at a lower cost. So that's a metric that -- return on that spend is a metric that our team is very focused on and makes decisions behind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nPeter Sullvian: This is Peter Sullvian calling for Stephanie Moore. I was just curious, I know you guys talked a little bit about modernization of SG&A expenses, specifically M&A expenses in 2Q. I'm curious if you could give a little bit more context on how those cost-cutting initiatives are developing and the progress you guys are making.\nKenneth Krause : Yes, we continue to make good progress. When you look at the earnings presentation, you'll see that the administrative side continues to improve. And so as a percentage of sales, we continue to see slight improvements in that area. We're pretty pleased with it in terms of the performance. But we continue to look at ways that we can continue to invest in the modernization of our business. And so -- but overall, we're pretty happy with the returns we've seen on the restructuring dollars we spent a little over a year ago now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Davies with Redburn Atlantic.\nOliver Davies : Just thinking into next year, and I guess given the investments you've made, would it be fair to assume you'd expect organic growth to kind of accelerate from the 7% to 8% range? Or is it kind of becoming more costly to maintain those above market growth rates?\nKenneth Krause : It's -- I'm not sure if it's a question or a comment. But from a standpoint of our organic growth of 7% to 8%, we're pretty happy with that level of growth, especially when you look at the quarter and you're trending closer to 8% as opposed to 7%. I'm pretty happy with the returns we're seeing. I'm not sure that we're ready to sign up for increased growth going into next year. But we're pretty happy with the pace of growth we're seeing in the business.\nJerry Gahlhoff : And I wouldn't think that achieving those levels of growth should cost us more to drive that growth. I don't see that there's some sort of increase in advertising or selling expense that we would anticipate at this point that would need to be invested in the business in order to maintain those rates.\nOliver Davies : And then just following on, you mentioned the kind of investment eased in the back end of the quarter. I guess, is that true on both the sales and sort of digital advertising side?\nKenneth Krause : Yes, that is true. What we saw, just looking at the numbers here and checking that. But what we saw is generally across the board, you saw in September more leverage come through the model than what you saw in July and August. And that's the big reason why when we were on our public webcast in mid-September, we talked about the fact that we were investing. We might see more investment come through. A big reason why is because of what we saw in July and August.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to the management for closing remarks.\nJerry Gahlhoff : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Kenneth Krause",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. We are now nine months into 2024 and we've delivered solid financial results. Year-to-date, we've delivered double-digit improvement across all major P&L metrics year-over-year and EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points, despite making significant investments in the business here in Q3. Cash flow continues to be strong, with free cash flow growing nearly 12% year-to-date, enabling a 10% increase to our dividend which we announced earlier this week. With this increase, we have raised our regular dividend by approximately 65% since the beginning of 2022, while continuing to meaningfully invest in the growth of our business. This is a reflection of our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our future. Looking closer at the third quarter, our team executed exceptionally well and delivered Q3 revenue growth of 9% year-over-year, with organic growth of 7.7% at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we've discussed this year. We delivered good growth across each of our service offerings. In the third quarter, residential revenues increased 6.4%, commercial pest control rose 9.4%, and termite and ancillary increased by 14.5%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio with growth of 4.9% in residential, 8.1% in commercial and 13.7% in the termite and ancillary area of our business. Turning to profitability, our gross margins were 54%, up 20 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. Pressures from incremental people investments were offset by leverage in materials and supplies as well as fleet. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue increased by 100 basis points versus last year. This was primarily driven by incremental investments in people to support our growth initiatives and the uptick in advertising spend that we expected and previously discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $192 million, up 8.3% year-over-year. Operating margins were 20.9%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $219 million, up over 5% and representing a 24% margin. Margins were down 80 basis points versus last year. And adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were 15.1% in the quarter, reflecting incremental investments in people and growth programs during the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter, and we continue to expect an ETR of approximately 26% for the year, which implies a rate that is just over 27% for the fourth quarter. Quarterly GAAP net income was $137 million or $0.28 per share, increasing 7.7% from $0.26 per share in the same period a year ago. Accounting for certain non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted net income for the quarter was $140 million or $0.29 per share, increasing nearly 4% from the same period a year ago, despite a higher level of interest costs and the investments we are making in growth oriented initiatives. We remain on track to deliver healthy profitability for the full year, driven by solid growth and an improving margin profile. We continue to focus on driving further improvements, while investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Quarterly cash flow was $139 million, up a very healthy 16% versus last year. Free cash flow conversion was 102% for the quarter and 110% year-to-date. We made acquisitions totaling $24 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have made acquisitions of $106 million and returned $218 million to shareholders through our dividend. Additionally, we had just announced a 10% increase to our dividend earlier this week. This represents over two decades of consecutive increases in annual dividend payments. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-time on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are well positioned and committed to continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation. In closing, we continue to focus on investing for growth, while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the last quarter of the year with healthy organic demand and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. We appreciate that. When we dive in and we look at the overall growth of the business, we continue to remain very optimistic, very confident in our outlook. We talked about 7% to 8%. We delivered 7.7% here in the quarter and 7.7% organic growth year-to-date. When you look closer at the residential business, it's an area that we're also pretty pleased with the performance, especially when we look at the recurring revenue in the business. Back in September, we spoke on a public webcast and talked about the fact that we were seeing 6% plus recurring revenue growth coming through the residential sector. And that's where we finished. That's where we've been for the better part of the year. And so, we're pretty pleased with that level of recurring revenue growth, especially in the residential sector. When I look at the business in the quarter, Jerry pointed out the fact that, unfortunately, we all had to deal with the effects of the hurricane late in the quarter. But if you set that aside and you look at what happened as a result of that hurricane, it probably had about a $2 million or so impact on revenue growth. And so we would have probably delivered organic growth that would have been slightly higher than the 7.7%, closer to the high end, the 8% that we have talked about in the business. So overall, we remain very pleased with the performance. The team is doing an exceptional job at delivering yet another quarter. We continue to remain confident in our outlook on incremental margins. With a business that's generating gross margins of 54%, we feel like the contribution or the incremental margins should be approximating that 30% level. And in fact, when you look at the quarter and you peel back the performance, you unpack the performance a little bit and look at it a little bit closer, what you see is that we spent more in selling and marketing. We saw an opportunity in a very attractive growth market to invest and grow our businesses, and just alluding to what Jerry just spoke about. So we spent a little bit more there. If you set that aside, along with some of the investments we made on the tech side to accelerate the start rate that we have in our business, you'd see an incremental margin that would be right around 30% here in the quarter. So we continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver 30% plus incremental margins longer term. Sure. When we look at the investments, this is a growth business. It's a growth market. We continue to see great growth opportunities. So we're going to continue to invest in the business. When I go back and unpack the investments we made this quarter, I would look at them through two or three lenses. One is on our service side and our service technicians. Because we know the importance of getting out and starting our lead -- getting our leads converted into starts, we have certainly invested in the service side of our business. That's probably about a 30 basis point headwind on gross margins in the quarter. The second area that we made investments here is in our sales and our sales engine and our sales people. We've talked about the fact that our commercial business remains a very important area of our business combined with our residential. And so, we're investing disproportionately in the sales end of our business and you saw that come through along with the increased advertising spend that we had here in the quarter to the tune of about 100 basis points. So you probably don't expect that level of investment every single quarter, but you're going to see us invest in this business following the various strategic initiatives that we talked about back at our Investor Day back in May. Both internally but also externally. When you look at CPI, we've consistently talked about CPI plus level of pricing. And CPI coming back roughly 2.5% recently gives us no reason to step back on the pricing and pare that back. We feel like this is an essential service and we should be able to be rewarded. And we should be able to reward our service technicians with the pricing that we've seen in the last couple of years. The team continues to do well. Scott Weaver is heading up our business in Orkin in the commercial side and we're seeing nice results there. But also I was just talking to our business leader, Rob Quinn yesterday up in Canada, and he's talking about the good performance we're seeing coming out of our Canadian commercial business. Substantially all commercial. And so really good results across both of those markets. No, nothing noteworthy there other than we're going to continue to deploy capital and M&A. We continue to have a focus on delivering 2% to 3% of revenue growth from M&A each year. Markets remain very healthy, an incredibly attractive market, so you certainly do have competition from time to time. But we've been able to separate ourselves by how we treat the acquisitions that we bring into the fold and how we treat the teams and the brands. And that's a meaningful difference for us in our markets. But in terms of new markets, we see so much opportunity. It's such a fragmented, such a large and growing market, the pest control market that we're going to continue to remain committed to that area. No, not the outlook. Not really impacting the outlook all that much. But the quarter, you look at Southeast, it was probably one of the slower growing regions in the quarter because of the hurricane impact late in the quarter. To the earlier question we had on the call, I do think that if we did not have the impact of that hurricane the last couple of days, we probably would have seen organic growth even stronger coming through as opposed to the 7.7%. So it did impact us. But as we think about the outlook, we feel like, as Jerry said, we have enough time here left in this quarter to make up for what we had in October. I think the thing that gave us the most hope was the fact that we were seeing 8% organic growth coming through. Leads were strong. Market was very healthy. So we continue to see that, and it's provided Jerry and I and the business leaders, Pat and Stanford, the level of confidence to invest. And it's not that we're investing in every single one of our brands at the same pace, but we did certainly were able to identify certain areas and make more significant investments in certain areas. And so that's really what came through. As far as the outlook and next steps go, yes, we're going to -- we can't say what pace we're going to invest in at this point, but we certainly are going to continue to invest. We firmly believe this is a growth market. This is a growth opportunity. And in order to be most successful, we've got to invest in our people and capturing additional customers. Hard to say what 2025 will be at this point just yet in terms of margin opportunity and spread. But when you're getting 3% to 4% price increase in this business, you should see margins improve. If I look at the quarter and I unpacked the quarter, we had 20 basis points of improvement in gross margin. But we invested 30 basis points in our service area. So when you set that aside, you had about 50 basis points of leverage coming through in the quarter in gross margin. It was good to see. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to deliver that pace of improvement going forward. But you know as well as I do that from a quarter-to-quarter basis, things can shift. I think to answer that question, we would look at what we communicated at Investor Day back in May. And really our plan and our hope is to see commercial business grow at a faster rate than our overall business. You might see resi a little bit slower from time to time, but your overall commercial business should be accretive to the overall organic growth profile of the business as we think about the near-term and the investments we're making. It's interesting you say that and you finish with that, Jerry, because if you just look at the quarter, what we saw was we gained leverage in those areas in September. And so more of our significant -- more significant investments were made in July and August. We didn't see as much investment coming through in September as you did earlier in the third quarter. Yes, we continue to make good progress. When you look at the earnings presentation, you'll see that the administrative side continues to improve. And so as a percentage of sales, we continue to see slight improvements in that area. We're pretty pleased with it in terms of the performance. But we continue to look at ways that we can continue to invest in the modernization of our business. And so -- but overall, we're pretty happy with the returns we've seen on the restructuring dollars we spent a little over a year ago now. It's -- I'm not sure if it's a question or a comment. But from a standpoint of our organic growth of 7% to 8%, we're pretty happy with that level of growth, especially when you look at the quarter and you're trending closer to 8% as opposed to 7%. I'm pretty happy with the returns we're seeing. I'm not sure that we're ready to sign up for increased growth going into next year. But we're pretty happy with the pace of growth we're seeing in the business. Yes, that is true. What we saw, just looking at the numbers here and checking that.

A big reason why is because of what we saw in July and August."

            "name": "Jerry Gahlhoff",
            "content": "Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. We would like to begin our discussion today by offering our support and encouragement to all of those who have been impacted by the recent hurricanes. I'm proud of the way our team has worked together to support our teammates and the communities we serve in the aftermath of these disasters. The Rollins' relief fund has processed over 250 emergency grants for teammates in need. And we continue to direct truckloads of food, water and other necessities to impacted areas. Our efforts will continue in the days, weeks and months ahead as these communities begin to recover. Turning to our financial results, our team delivered another solid quarter, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our team delivered these results despite some operational disruption caused by Hurricane Helene, which occurred during the last week of the quarter. Our financial performance for the third quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 9% to $916 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines. We continue to invest in growing our business and adding to our customer base, as the markets we serve remain strong. We invested significantly in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities in Q3 and we're well staffed to convert quality leads and sales efforts into new customer growth, which our results in the quarter reflect. On the commercial side of the business, we continue to make long-term investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities in a multi-billion dollar B2B market. Our commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 32 tuck-in deals in the first nine months of the year and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Tim will discuss in more detail, but investments we made to support long-term growth objectives did temper margins a bit in the quarter. But we remain on track to deliver healthy margin improvement and profitability for the year. In yesterday's release, we also announced a planned leadership transition at our board of directors. In accordance with the company's long-term leadership succession plan, Gary Rollins will transition from Executive Chairman to Executive Chairman Emeritus and John Wilson will succeed him as Executive Chairman of the Board. Gary was elected to a three-year term during our 2024 annual meeting and will continue to be an active and engaged member of our board. John has been with our company since 1996 in various positions of increasing responsibility. I've known John for 20 years and his experience and guidance have been invaluable to me as I have transitioned to the role of CEO over the last two years. I look forward to continuing to work with John, Gary and the rest of our Board as we position our company for continued success in the future. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. And the health of the residential consumer does appear still strong to us. We see good growth in termite and ancillary, a good acceptance of our cross-sell campaigns and other things. So if there's anything that's been more inconsistent, it's the onetime piece. And the residential recurring, that's what we're really investing in with marketing, trying to drive quality leads. That's what we invest in with door-to-door and any other type of channel that we go to is to try to create recurring revenue streams. And the investments we made in the third quarter will pay off for us in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year as our customer base is bigger as we head into the back end of the year. Yes, this quarter is more of a timing issue more than anything as we indicated at the end of Q2. And to add a little color to that when I look back at Q3 of 2023 compared to 2024 on our staffing levels, just thinking -- just peeling back, just working itself. You think on the commercial side, we are looking at the data to say, hey, where do we have adequate coverage given the market and we're going to continue to invest where that opportunity is there. If it gets difficult to scale or the data sets that we've got good penetrated -- the penetration that we need and we have the right people in the right places for where the opportunities are that will certainly slow down. But we'll let the data and then how we're doing operationally from a scalability standpoint will help us dictate that. And then on the residential side, selling termite, cross-sell, ancillary business, those kinds of things that staffing is up double-digits just like the commercial side is as we continue to make those investments there. And the opportunities there, the consumer is taking the services and buying the services, as you see in our results. And we find that to be a very worthwhile investment and we'll continue to do that so long as the market holds it. So Ken and I just recently spent hours in a room together reviewing those data from our price increase results this year, and there's not been anything in there that -- in the data from what we see and what we understand about the consumer that scares us off of continuing to get a fair price for our service. And if we're doing a good job, we should reward -- be rewarded for that, and our technicians in the field should be rewarded for that as well. So we've not seen anything in the data that would cause us to change course from anything that we've already indicated to you. Yes. We still continue to have a pretty long runway on the commercial side and how we structure that business, how we open new branches. And to your point about opening another division, those types of things, we're still in -- probably in the first two or three innings of what's possible there on the commercial side, and we're going to continue to invest in those opportunities. And even from a margin standpoint, the commercial side tends to drive some stickier customer base and just -- and a very appealing margin opportunity there as well on that side of the business. So we see nothing but good things from the future on that commercial strategy. And we're just, like I said, still in the early stages. I don't think there's been anything -- any sort of significant shift in that space how -- from a competitive standpoint. I think we've been making a more conservative effort, especially within the Orkin brand to focus on the commercial side and our marketing strategy there. And we've allocated more dollars into the commercial space ourselves to do that. But I don't think there's been any significant shift in the competitive environment or anything along those lines from an advertising standpoint or a go-to-market strategy that we've seen. Mostly a commercial business. Yes. We're always looking for new services and new opportunities in and around the home that we can maybe expand to. And some of those are geographic in nature based on construction type of the house or certain types of pests and things like that. So there haven't been anything -- there's nothing revolutionary that we've seen other than the continuation of adding more sales staff to increase the number of customers with more than one service for us. And that's why we continue to be so successful adding our home sales inspectors to offer those types of ancillary services. And another great opportunity is selling more recurring termite. We have a lot of customers that have pest control that don't have termite control that we can continue to offer that service to through cross-marketing, cross-selling campaigns. So we're pretty good at sticking to what works. There's so much opportunity there and we're just continuing to invest and drive that part of the business. So it was really the -- obviously, the Southeast United States, the coastal areas of Florida where we have a strong presence, both in the Orkin brands as well as brands like HomeTeam in Northwest, all up the West Coast of Florida and parts of the East Coast of Florida too as that storm had pushed through and had tornadoes in the southeast and central part of the Eastern Coast of Florida. So there was a lot going on there. We had a lot of branch closures for several days. We focus on making sure we are prepared for the storms as they're coming and letting our people prepare. We know that the more people prepare, the faster we can respond and get back to work if people are in a good place themselves. So we had a lot of branch closures for several days. We got back up on our feet after Helene. And then Wham, you get another one that caused significantly more challenges. Talking to our people in the field, number one, it happened very early in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. So it gives us plenty of time to respond and recover. I'm sure there will be some customer losses along the coastal -- the immediate coast. But I don't think that's anything too severe that we can't recover from. We've looked at our forecast for October and the future and there's really nothing there, Ken that we've seen in the Southeast U.S. that gives us a lot of pause about the fourth quarter, is there? And I think part of the algorithm is that you want to acquire customers in the second and third quarter, build your base. Because the phones aren't ringing near as much in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as they do in peak season. So in Q2, Q3 is where you grow your recurring customer base and that's your bread and butter as you go into the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2025, is having a significantly higher customer base in which to serve. That -- and so that makes me very comfortable with the outlook knowing the customer base is healthy and strong. Yes. So I don't -- when you think about from a sales staffing, are you talking more on the sales staffing or the technician front? Yes. So if you have the right amount of growth and you have route splits and branch openings and things like that, that were -- and you're trying to maintain the right balance of the number of customers on, say, a service technician's route, things like that, we'll always add. And usually, that's that could occur toward -- more towards the end of season, in the third quarter where we do route splits and things along those lines. And that's the right time to add those customers -- or add those technicians. On the sales side, we have over the last several years taken and hired really year-round and continuing to. What we're cognizant of is one of the things I mentioned, is like how fast can you scale, how fast can you train the right amount. So we're trying to take a balanced approach rather than hiring a bunch of onetime a year, trying to train. Let's say, it's easier to train 20 people in a class that you have four, five classes a year and you're adding 100 than it is to try to add 60 in a quarter and ramp it up and because your success rate of hiring 60 versus hiring 20 and putting the time and attention to them in that you need is a little more challenging. So we've taken a more balanced approach to how we onboard and how we time those hires and add strategically over time. And that means we will be making hires throughout the year. I will say generally speaking, though, when we get into the fourth quarter, we do tend to -- especially on home sales inspectors on the residential side, there's a lot less of that hiring. It will usually begin again in the January, February timeframe before we head in the season. While on the commercial side, it's a little bit more of a year-round type of event. That's a good point, Ken, because a lot of that in the quarter was very front-end loaded in the early part of Q3. And then we kind of wind it down, yes. Yes. We do measure return on ad spend or roll off. That's a key metric. And that's what makes the -- and particular in the digital channel, so dynamic and where if you look at Q2, when we spent a little less. You're looking at the market, you're looking at the cost to drive the leads in the digital space and you're making adjustments. You may decide to hold off. You may have -- maybe there's some local regional competitors doing some things, and you just say, hey, I'm going to back off for a little while and wait for this to settle down. And then we're going to -- and then you're going to invest a little bit more a little later in the season and into the third quarter where you can drive lower cost of customer acquisition on a better return on your ad spend. So we're always looking at that. And we have been able to manage those costs pretty well to that point too of -- well, again, I know we've said this like a broken record, but we're still going to continue to be disciplined in our advertising spend such that as a percent of revenue, say, on the Orkin brand, they're going to spend as a percent of revenue a very similar amount as a percent of revenue that we have been committed to for years that amount. So it's a little more in dollars year-to-year as the business grows. But in order to do that, we've got to do -- we've always got to strive to do more with those dollars, acquire customers at a lower cost. So that's a metric that -- return on that spend is a metric that our team is very focused on and makes decisions behind. And I wouldn't think that achieving those levels of growth should cost us more to drive that growth. I don't see that there's some sort of increase in advertising or selling expense that we would anticipate at this point that would need to be invested in the business in order to maintain those rates. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce your host Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Burton. You may begin.\nLyndsey Burton: Thank you and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Management will make some opening remarks and then we'll open the line for your questions. Jerry, would you like to begin?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 8.7% to $892 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines as total residential revenue increased 6.3%, commercial rose 9.9%, and termite and ancillary was up 11.8% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business. As you would expect, we made strategic investments in incremental sales, staffing and marketing activities during the quarter. We will continue to invest throughout Q3 to ensure that we remain top of mind and well-positioned for share gains as peak pest season continues. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front so that our people are on boarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. This also means that we are positioned to convert our marketing and sales investments into new customer growth. Our team continuously challenges itself to think of new and different ways to enhance the relevance the relevance of our brands with current and future customers. Earlier in the summer, our creative team at Orkin partnered with Emmy nominated composer, Bryan Rheude, to compose a seven-act symphony crafted entirely around the historic emergence of two broods of cicadas. We hosted the Orkinstra symphony live in Springfield, Illinois, with curated music composed to accompany the recorded songs and rhythms of trillions of cicadas. The event garnered hundreds of millions of impressions for the Orkin brand, and support for this unique initiative continues as the symphony is currently available on all streaming platforms. In fact, I listened to it again just the other day on a flight and found it to be very relaxing. I encourage you to check it out. On the commercial side of the business, investments we've made to capitalize on a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity in the B2B space continue to pay dividends. Our new commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our salesforce, and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 26 tuck-in deals in the first six months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure, and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Safety remains an important area of focus. In Q2, we enhanced our onboarding program for new teammates by providing more robust safety training, with an emphasis on how we equip our new drivers with the technical skills, awareness and courtesy needed to be safe on our roads and in the neighborhoods we serve. Our efforts continue to yield solid driver safety scores and further reinforce the culture of safety we strive to promote throughout our company. We continue to look for ways to modernize our company, and to that end, our Board of Directors recently amended and restated our bylaws to transition from a classified board structure to a declassified one. Going forward, board members that are up for reelection will be elected to one year terms. This step aligns with corporate governance best practices. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Demand from our customers remained strong with over 7% organic growth in the quarter, and for the first half of the year. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Krause: Thanks Jerry and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start, we delivered Q2 revenue growth of 8.7% year-over-year with organic growth of 7.7%. That was at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we discussed in our recent Investor Day. Despite having two less business days in June relative to the prior year, through the first half of the year, the team delivered total revenue growth of 10.9% and solid organic revenue growth of 7.6%. Incremental EBITDA margins were over 30% for the first half of the year and approached 40% in the second quarter, ahead of the metrics we discussed in our recent Investor Day, driven by strong leverage throughout the P&L. And last but not least, our team delivered operating cash flow of $145 million and free cash flow of $136 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow approximates $273 million and free cash flow approximates $257 million, both growing 10% with very healthy conversion. Driving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Residential revenues increased 6.3%, commercial pest control rose 9.9%, and our termite and ancillary services increased by 11.8%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 5.4% in residential, 8.6% in commercial, and 11.1% in termite and ancillary services. Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were 54%, up 80 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. We realized improvements across several cost categories, with the most notable contributions coming from fleet and insurance and claims. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 60 basis points versus last year. While we saw improvements in insurance claims activity, we also saw leverage across several cost categories. We did see some leverage from customer acquisition costs in the quarter, but we continue to focus on driving demand for our services and expect to make additional investments in these areas during the third quarter. Second quarter GAAP operating income was $182 million, up approximately 18% year-over-year on 8.7% revenue growth. Operating margins were 20.4%, up 150 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins and solid expense leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $210 million, up over 15% and representing a 23.6% margin. Margins were up 140 basis points versus last year, and adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were approaching 40%, supported by benefits from more favorable claims activity as well as underlying leverage in more traditional operating expense categories. I'm pleased with the strong improvements in profitability in the quarter and for the first half of 2024. We delivered solid growth with an improving margin profile and remain focused on investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter. Our ETR was 25.3% for the first half, and we expect this rate to approximate 26% for the year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.27 per share, increasing approximately 23% from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. For the second quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated primarily with the Fox acquisition related items totaling approximately $4 million of pretax expense in the quarter. Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $132 million, or $0.27 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest costs. Speaking of interest costs, we expect a similar run rate in these costs for the second half relative to the first half. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $145 million and we generated $136 million of free cash flow. This is slightly down versus last year, driven by working capital timing. With that said, I'm pleased with the 10% growth in first half cash flow. Our business remains very well-positioned to continue to deliver healthy cash flow performance, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow, was over 100% for the quarter, as well as for the first six months. We made acquisitions totaling $35 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-times on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is very healthy and it positions us well heading into the second half of the year. In closing, our performance this quarter and throughout the first half of 2024 continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We continue to focus on driving growth while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the second half with healthy organic demand, and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please proceed.\nTim Mulrooney: Jerry, Ken, good morning.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Good morning.\nKenneth Krause: Morning.\nTim Mulrooney: Just one from me on the profitability. Strong profitability seems to be the theme of the quarter here, so I wanted to dig in a little bit on this. Ken, as you highlighted in your prepared remarks, your incremental margins were very strong in the quarter, approaching 40%. But I know there were some elevated claims activity in the prior year period, if I'm remembering correctly. So, if we exclude that, then how did your incremental margins look? Were they still above that historical average range of 25% to 30%?\nKenneth Krause: Thank you for the question, Tim. Appreciate that. And it's a great question, something that we certainly took a close look at as we prepared for the call and reviewed the quarter. And what we found was business -- the performance continues to be exceptional. The margin performance was incredibly healthy. We saw leverage across gross margin. We also saw improvements in SG&A. As you indicated, our quarterly incremental margin approached 40%. If you exclude some of those non-operational items, I would call it our incremental margins were still at or above 30%. And that's the pace that we like to see. And in fact, if we go back a couple of years, we've seen some great improvement on those margins. So, it's good to see those margins coming in, even without the benefit of some of those non-operational items at or above the 30% range.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you very much. Nice quarter, guys.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Really strong momentum in the business. But if I had to nitpick on consumer, we did see improvement in the organic growth compared to first quarter, but it's trending slightly below what we've seen historically. So, I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on that front. What are we seeing on recurring versus ad hoc services. And also, was there any impact of the two fewer working days in June? Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: So, Ashish, this is Jerry. So, when we look at the quarter, I'll start with the two fewer working days in June. I mean, that was a pretty significant impact for us in the quarter. You're in the thick of your peak season right in the middle of the year to have two or fewer workdays. More than anything, even though we had a bit of a softer June last year, it affected productivity fairly significantly about ability to get work done and things along those lines. So, I would much rather have those two extra days in a June than I would in an April very early, very early in the quarter. So that's interesting. And there was some impact there. The recurring business is the additions to our new customer growth are actually outpacing our organic revenue growth. So that's healthy. So, when you think about the consumer side of it, the one-time business, while it's still there, it may be a little softer on some of the residential pest control, but we still see a very strong consumer in the marketplace. That consumer, when you look at our termite and ancillary growth in the double-digit range, that tells you, you still have a healthy consumer that really is staying in their home. There's a lot less relocation going on. People are staying at home, investing in their homes and certainly buying things like pest control and adding that to their home services. That is still remaining very, very healthy. So, we haven't really seen any shift from a consumer side in that regard either. Would you add anything to that, Ken?\nKenneth Krause: The only thing I would say is we had, what was it, 5.4% residential growth. And so when you look at the one-time or the recurring business was at or above 6% in the quarter. And when you take into consideration some of those factors you described, I mean, they certainly had an -- they have a potential of having an impact on the overall growth rate. So, we feel good about the level of growth we saw in the quarter, the level of activity around customers and the demand levels we continue to see going into the third quarter.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color. And maybe on my follow up, if I can ask a quick question on the commercial side, you talked about the investments there to capture -- capitalize. I was wondering if you could talk about, are there certain verticals where you're seeing stronger demand environment. Thanks.\nJerry Gahlhoff: We -- I don't think we've seen necessarily a stronger demand in certain verticals. What -- where we're getting our results is by building the biggest and best salesforce on the commercial side that we can -- that is possible out there. We continue to add to our salesforce, invest in their training, invest in development and building a very strong cohesive team on the commercial sales side. That's really what's paying dividends, not necessarily one vertical or another. I think we're out there just trying to capture new business through the new people that we're adding to our team.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks and congrats on a solid quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ashish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Is there any way to estimate -- morning. Any way to estimate how much impact the two fewer working days in June affected organic growth in each of your segments. Was the impact greater in certain segments than others?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah. I don't think it was greater in certain segments than others, necessarily. Although, my intuition tells me it affected us more in the residential pest and then maybe a little bit on the termite and ancillary because those are often larger jobs that take time to get, take time to complete. And when you talk about having two fewer days in a month, in a month like June, it will result in some of that work carrying over, not being completed into July. That last year would have been completed in June. So, it's really that kind of impact, more probably on the residential, both pest, and termite and ancillary than on the commercial side.\nKenneth Krause: And it can probably impact both one time as well as recurring business because we don't have the opportunity to get out and maybe start the recurring business because we're losing those days. And we're also just not seeing the calls from the one-time because we don't have those days, right? You don't get as much one-time in the very -- in the peak of the peak season.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. On the residential side, you also mentioned that you're seeing healthy demand levels heading into 3Q. What kind of acceleration would be possible given the exit rates that you've been seeing for the residential business?\nKenneth Krause: Yeah. I wouldn't want to say that we're seeing acceleration in the Q3, but we continue to see just consistent levels of demand for our services and very much giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on the range of growth that we provided at Investor Day of roughly 7% to 8% organic growth. I mean, through the first six months were 7.6% and in the quarter we were at the high end of the range. So, we feel good about this business and the ability to drive value for all of our stakeholders when we're seeing demand levels like we saw here in Q2.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nHilary Lee: Hi, guys. This is Hilary Lee on for Toni Kaplan. So, just wanted to talk about the trends that you're kind of seeing in residential and commercial. Like, what -- did you see any changes throughout the months in 2Q, and what have you seen into July so far?\nKenneth Krause: The trends have been positive. Demand remains healthy, and both resi as well as commercial, all giving us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver that 7% to 8% of organic growth that I just spoke about. And so, generally, as Jerry indicated, it was unfortunate the way the calendar fell where you lose a couple of days in peak season, but we certainly continue to see the things that are in our control give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goals that we've set for ourselves.\nJerry Gahlhoff: That's exactly right, Ken. We don't really see any headwinds that could have some significant impact on what we continue to see.\nHilary Lee: Got it. And just to kind of dovetail off that, it's been kind of a -- not unusually, but warmer July than in recent memory. Do you expect that to kind of help out with the peak season this year, and any indication on what you guys do with taking care of the cicada issue, or is that not really an issue for you guys to handle, even though regarding the symphony as well?\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah. I've given up a long time ago trying to predict the weather and what bugs are going to do and pests are going to do about the weather. And so, generally speaking, warmer weather is good for business, but you just never know how fast that could change. If you recall back last year in June, we went through that cold spell and a little bit of June that softened for a couple of weeks there. And then in July, it picked back up and things went crazy again. So, you just kind of never know what's in store in terms of the weather. And we really don't think too much about the weather. In terms of the cicadas, Ashish is probably still listening. He asked about the cicadas. They're typically, to a consumer, not a pest, not a while they are a perceived pest problem. It's not something we can do much about. As I mentioned, you're talking about millions, potentially trillions of cicadas, and the extent that you would have to go through to quiet them down would be pretty extreme. That's not something we necessarily do. Instead, we've chosen to have a little fun with it, create some consumer demand and build some brand recognition around the attention that the cicadas are getting. Not really a pest problem, however. On the weather -- just adding on the weather, you are right. You see statistics about warming environment and things like that. But the other side of it is you just never know what hurricane season might look like here. As you get into August and September, I think a lot of people are predicting a pretty tough hurricane season. So that could have a disruption, a short-term disruption, but you just never know. I mean, overall, when we look at the things we control and we look at what we're doing, we feel good about the demand levels that we're seeing across our business.\nHilary Lee: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to drill down on commentary around investing in marketing and customer acquisition. Just how your -- just the pace of it this quarter, how you're thinking about it in the back half and what you're seeing from the competition as well.\nKenneth Krause: From a competitive standpoint, I don't know that we pay a lot of attention to what's going on in that regard. We kind of look at our business and know what our needs are and measure things on a market-to-market basis. You have to remember, we're still in a very highly fragmented business with a lot of competition, and that includes regional competitors and everything is just so local. So, from that standpoint, that just is one of the most dynamic things that we do that can change week to week, sometimes day to day. I will say philosophically, if you look back to how say, the digital marketplace was 10 or five to 10 years ago compared to today, it has shifted. And some of that philosophy has shifted over the last few years where we used to spend a lot of our money on the advertising and especially in digital, digital performance, a lot of that was spent, say, late April into September. So, you have this curve with a spike that really went right in the middle of season. And what we've seen now is now that we have these shoulder seasons of pest activity, you've got generally warmer environments, that curve is kind of softened in the middle. And we put more of our dollars on both tails of that curve where we're now starting. A lot of the, lot of those processes on the digital side are now starting in March and running well into October, maybe even early November if the weather holds up and the demand is still good. So, we now kind of -- we really spread it out a little differently than we used to do just because of some of the climate weather dynamics that are out there. So -- but at the same time, even within those quarters, even within that, call it nine-month period of time where we spend most of our marketing, it's still a pretty dynamic decision making process.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, dynamic. And to the point of, like when you look at this quarter and you try to understand the impact of that, you saw a little bit less, you saw some leverage in our selling and marketing costs. And some of that was in the advertising area, as we had pointed out in our presentation that's posted online. What we're seeing, though, is we're ramping that investment here into Q3, and so to take advantage of that longer shoulder season. And so, we're expecting to see a bit of an uptick in these advertising efforts here as we go throughout July because the markets are very healthy for us.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Please proceed.\nJoshua Chan: Hi. Good morning, Jerry and Ken. Maybe sticking with marketing, I know that across your brand you do a variety of different channels of marketing. Are there certain channels that are more successful this particular year than other channels that you've noticed?\nJerry Gahlhoff: I don't think any of the channels are necessarily any better or any worse. I think we're doing well in all of them. And it's really about having a balanced approach, balance of how you spend, making sure that we're spending our money wisely, getting the return on investment that we want. We don't want to just drive leads for the sake of driving leads where we don't have the capacity to fulfill the demand and all those things come into play. So, I think our brands and our businesses have done a pretty good job of ensuring that what we do, we're disciplined about, we execute to it and we measure our results and we measure our return on investment. So, it's been pretty solid across all those channels.\nJoshua Chan: Okay. That's great to hear. And for my follow up, is there any geographic differences in growth within the country that is notable, or are the regions growing pretty similarly this quarter? Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: I think -- Ken, we've seen pretty solid growth across the business. Geographically, I wouldn't say there's been any significant difference where there's some market that's radically lagging another market or part of the country or even international. So, I would say generally across the board, it tends to be fairly healthy.\nKenneth Krause: No, I tend to agree as well. I mean, sure, we have things we're doing in certain brands and I trying to drive improved performance in certain areas, but overall, the market seems pretty healthy, whether it be the western United States, the southeastern United States. I mean, what we saw earlier in the quarter was, there was maybe a slower start in certain parts of the southeast, but they came right online as we went throughout the quarter and saw some good demand levels. Canada and our commercial business up there, continues to do well. So, generally, we're seeing really good performance in the business.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yeah. And usually if you see those differences, it usually comes on the edges, the back edges of those shoulder seasons, or in the wintertime when extreme weather may impact it more is usually when we see more of those differences geographically.\nJoshua Chan: That's great color. Thanks for the time, and congrats on a good quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aadit Shrestha from Stifel. Please proceed.\nAadit Shrestha: Hi, Jerry and Ken. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to gross profit, it was up 80 basis points this quarter. So, it's another strong quarter. But could you maybe break out how much of that was driven by overall price cost spread versus the tailwind from insurance and claims and fleet?\nKenneth Krause: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I want to say the 80 basis points of gross margin leverage, roughly 30 of that is your insurance and claims activity, and the remainder is just good leverage across the gross margin categories, the cost categories. So, fleet, for example, we saw some good leverage there. And so just generally we're seeing combination. As I said earlier, a good combination of some of the more favorable experience on the claims in the quarter, coupled with some operational leverage and prices certainly contributed to that as well.\nAadit Shrestha: Great. And just to follow up, not really a follow up, completely not related. The 11% organic growth that seemed to have accelerated within termite and ancillary services, how did that split out between the two? Was one better than the other?\nKenneth Krause: So, I can give you a little color on that. Both those service lines continue to grow very well. Some of the ancillary business does tend to be sort of a higher dollar amount, higher ticket price, and is a little easier to grow at a somewhat faster rate than just pure termite. But generally both are growing quite well. Both are in the double-digit range, and both have been very healthy for us.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, they've both been really good performance for us here, especially in the quarter. Continue to see good demand levels.\nAadit Shrestha: Great. Thanks. And congratulations on great quarter.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please proceed.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nJerry Gahlhoff: Morning.\nStephanie Moore: I wanted to touch -- morning. I wanted to touch on maybe acquisitions quickly here, maybe any heightened competition for deals that you're seeing. And then from a strategic standpoint, maybe any areas within pest that are particularly attractive to you guys at the moment. Thanks.\nKenneth Krause: We continue to be very acquisitive. I think we closed 26 deals in the first half. If you go back a few years, you were seeing 30, 35 deals on a full year basis. So, we continue to see good demand levels, certainly always going to be competition. This is an incredibly attractive market space and a lot of people were interested in it. But we feel like our brand of acquirer of choice that we talked about in May and at Investor Day and how we take care and invest in our people and preserve brands is certainly paying off for us. We continue to be very active in evaluating additional opportunities. Jerry and I have spent some time on the road the last month or so, and we continue to look for new and interesting ideas. And it's not just looking at new and interesting ideas, but it's about also investing in relationships with people that might consider selling their business in the future. This is a long-term approach. It's not really focused on an auction or anything like that. It's about how do you develop the relationships with people, so they're comfortable turning the keys over to something that is incredibly important and valuable to them. And so, we're trying to take the time to continue to develop that and we think we're seeing some good results.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. Thank you. And then just as my follow up, sorry if I missed it. But did you say how July organic growth has trended?\nKenneth Krause: We haven't. We've consistently said is that it's continuing to see -- we're seeing business that is coming in to give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the ranges that we've set for ourselves. And so, we feel pretty good about our ability to do that.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. Thanks so much.\nKenneth Krause: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call later this year. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks Jerry and good morning, everyone. The second quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start, we delivered Q2 revenue growth of 8.7% year-over-year with organic growth of 7.7%. That was at the high end of the 7% to 8% range we discussed in our recent Investor Day. Despite having two less business days in June relative to the prior year, through the first half of the year, the team delivered total revenue growth of 10.9% and solid organic revenue growth of 7.6%. Incremental EBITDA margins were over 30% for the first half of the year and approached 40% in the second quarter, ahead of the metrics we discussed in our recent Investor Day, driven by strong leverage throughout the P&L. And last but not least, our team delivered operating cash flow of $145 million and free cash flow of $136 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow approximates $273 million and free cash flow approximates $257 million, both growing 10% with very healthy conversion. Driving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. Residential revenues increased 6.3%, commercial pest control rose 9.9%, and our termite and ancillary services increased by 11.8%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 5.4% in residential, 8.6% in commercial, and 11.1% in termite and ancillary services. Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were 54%, up 80 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation. We realized improvements across several cost categories, with the most notable contributions coming from fleet and insurance and claims. Quarterly adjusted SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 60 basis points versus last year. While we saw improvements in insurance claims activity, we also saw leverage across several cost categories. We did see some leverage from customer acquisition costs in the quarter, but we continue to focus on driving demand for our services and expect to make additional investments in these areas during the third quarter. Second quarter GAAP operating income was $182 million, up approximately 18% year-over-year on 8.7% revenue growth. Operating margins were 20.4%, up 150 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins and solid expense leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $210 million, up over 15% and representing a 23.6% margin. Margins were up 140 basis points versus last year, and adjusted incremental EBITDA margins were approaching 40%, supported by benefits from more favorable claims activity as well as underlying leverage in more traditional operating expense categories. I'm pleased with the strong improvements in profitability in the quarter and for the first half of 2024. We delivered solid growth with an improving margin profile and remain focused on investing in our business and capturing growth in our very attractive end markets. The effective tax rate was approximately 26.1% in the quarter. Our ETR was 25.3% for the first half, and we expect this rate to approximate 26% for the year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.27 per share, increasing approximately 23% from $0.22 per share in the same period a year ago. For the second quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated primarily with the Fox acquisition related items totaling approximately $4 million of pretax expense in the quarter. Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $132 million, or $0.27 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest costs. Speaking of interest costs, we expect a similar run rate in these costs for the second half relative to the first half. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $145 million and we generated $136 million of free cash flow. This is slightly down versus last year, driven by working capital timing. With that said, I'm pleased with the 10% growth in first half cash flow. Our business remains very well-positioned to continue to deliver healthy cash flow performance, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow, was over 100% for the quarter, as well as for the first six months. We made acquisitions totaling $35 million and we paid $73 million in dividends in the quarter. Debt to EBITDA leverage is well below one-times on a gross and net level. Our balance sheet is very healthy and it positions us well heading into the second half of the year. In closing, our performance this quarter and throughout the first half of 2024 continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our team. We continue to focus on driving growth while executing on our continuous improvement and modernization initiatives. We are starting the second half with healthy organic demand, and we remain committed to investing in our people and providing our customers with the best customer experience. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Morning. Thank you for the question, Tim. Appreciate that. And it's a great question, something that we certainly took a close look at as we prepared for the call and reviewed the quarter. And what we found was business -- the performance continues to be exceptional. The margin performance was incredibly healthy. We saw leverage across gross margin. We also saw improvements in SG&A. As you indicated, our quarterly incremental margin approached 40%. If you exclude some of those non-operational items, I would call it our incremental margins were still at or above 30%. And that's the pace that we like to see. And in fact, if we go back a couple of years, we've seen some great improvement on those margins. So, it's good to see those margins coming in, even without the benefit of some of those non-operational items at or above the 30% range. Thank you. The only thing I would say is we had, what was it, 5.4% residential growth. And so when you look at the one-time or the recurring business was at or above 6% in the quarter. And when you take into consideration some of those factors you described, I mean, they certainly had an -- they have a potential of having an impact on the overall growth rate. So, we feel good about the level of growth we saw in the quarter, the level of activity around customers and the demand levels we continue to see going into the third quarter. And it can probably impact both one time as well as recurring business because we don't have the opportunity to get out and maybe start the recurring business because we're losing those days. And we're also just not seeing the calls from the one-time because we don't have those days, right? You don't get as much one-time in the very -- in the peak of the peak season. Yeah. I wouldn't want to say that we're seeing acceleration in the Q3, but we continue to see just consistent levels of demand for our services and very much giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on the range of growth that we provided at Investor Day of roughly 7% to 8% organic growth. I mean, through the first six months were 7.6% and in the quarter we were at the high end of the range. So, we feel good about this business and the ability to drive value for all of our stakeholders when we're seeing demand levels like we saw here in Q2. The trends have been positive. Demand remains healthy, and both resi as well as commercial, all giving us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver that 7% to 8% of organic growth that I just spoke about. And so, generally, as Jerry indicated, it was unfortunate the way the calendar fell where you lose a couple of days in peak season, but we certainly continue to see the things that are in our control give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our goals that we've set for ourselves. From a competitive standpoint, I don't know that we pay a lot of attention to what's going on in that regard. We kind of look at our business and know what our needs are and measure things on a market-to-market basis. You have to remember, we're still in a very highly fragmented business with a lot of competition, and that includes regional competitors and everything is just so local. So, from that standpoint, that just is one of the most dynamic things that we do that can change week to week, sometimes day to day. I will say philosophically, if you look back to how say, the digital marketplace was 10 or five to 10 years ago compared to today, it has shifted. And some of that philosophy has shifted over the last few years where we used to spend a lot of our money on the advertising and especially in digital, digital performance, a lot of that was spent, say, late April into September. So, you have this curve with a spike that really went right in the middle of season. And what we've seen now is now that we have these shoulder seasons of pest activity, you've got generally warmer environments, that curve is kind of softened in the middle. And we put more of our dollars on both tails of that curve where we're now starting. A lot of the, lot of those processes on the digital side are now starting in March and running well into October, maybe even early November if the weather holds up and the demand is still good. So, we now kind of -- we really spread it out a little differently than we used to do just because of some of the climate weather dynamics that are out there. So -- but at the same time, even within those quarters, even within that, call it nine-month period of time where we spend most of our marketing, it's still a pretty dynamic decision making process. No, I tend to agree as well. I mean, sure, we have things we're doing in certain brands and I trying to drive improved performance in certain areas, but overall, the market seems pretty healthy, whether it be the western United States, the southeastern United States. I mean, what we saw earlier in the quarter was, there was maybe a slower start in certain parts of the southeast, but they came right online as we went throughout the quarter and saw some good demand levels. Canada and our commercial business up there, continues to do well. So, generally, we're seeing really good performance in the business. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I want to say the 80 basis points of gross margin leverage, roughly 30 of that is your insurance and claims activity, and the remainder is just good leverage across the gross margin categories, the cost categories. So, fleet, for example, we saw some good leverage there. And so just generally we're seeing combination. As I said earlier, a good combination of some of the more favorable experience on the claims in the quarter, coupled with some operational leverage and prices certainly contributed to that as well. So, I can give you a little color on that. Both those service lines continue to grow very well. Some of the ancillary business does tend to be sort of a higher dollar amount, higher ticket price, and is a little easier to grow at a somewhat faster rate than just pure termite. But generally both are growing quite well. Both are in the double-digit range, and both have been very healthy for us. We continue to be very acquisitive. I think we closed 26 deals in the first half. If you go back a few years, you were seeing 30, 35 deals on a full year basis. So, we continue to see good demand levels, certainly always going to be competition. This is an incredibly attractive market space and a lot of people were interested in it. But we feel like our brand of acquirer of choice that we talked about in May and at Investor Day and how we take care and invest in our people and preserve brands is certainly paying off for us. We continue to be very active in evaluating additional opportunities. Jerry and I have spent some time on the road the last month or so, and we continue to look for new and interesting ideas.

It's about how do you develop the relationships with people, so they're comfortable turning the keys over to something that is incredibly important and valuable to them. And so, we're trying to take the time to continue to develop that and we think we're seeing some good results. We haven't. We've consistently said is that it's continuing to see -- we're seeing business that is coming in to give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the ranges that we've set for ourselves. And so, we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the second quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of 8.7% to $892 million and we delivered healthy organic growth of 7.7% in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see solid revenue growth across all major service lines as total residential revenue increased 6.3%, commercial rose 9.9%, and termite and ancillary was up 11.8% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business. As you would expect, we made strategic investments in incremental sales, staffing and marketing activities during the quarter. We will continue to invest throughout Q3 to ensure that we remain top of mind and well-positioned for share gains as peak pest season continues. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front so that our people are on boarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. This also means that we are positioned to convert our marketing and sales investments into new customer growth. Our team continuously challenges itself to think of new and different ways to enhance the relevance the relevance of our brands with current and future customers. Earlier in the summer, our creative team at Orkin partnered with Emmy nominated composer, Bryan Rheude, to compose a seven-act symphony crafted entirely around the historic emergence of two broods of cicadas. We hosted the Orkinstra symphony live in Springfield, Illinois, with curated music composed to accompany the recorded songs and rhythms of trillions of cicadas. The event garnered hundreds of millions of impressions for the Orkin brand, and support for this unique initiative continues as the symphony is currently available on all streaming platforms. In fact, I listened to it again just the other day on a flight and found it to be very relaxing. I encourage you to check it out. On the commercial side of the business, investments we've made to capitalize on a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity in the B2B space continue to pay dividends. Our new commercial division continues to strategically add feet on the street to our salesforce, and we are leveraging data analytics and training to better enable their success. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. We closed 26 tuck-in deals in the first six months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure, and drove efficiencies throughout the business. Safety remains an important area of focus. In Q2, we enhanced our onboarding program for new teammates by providing more robust safety training, with an emphasis on how we equip our new drivers with the technical skills, awareness and courtesy needed to be safe on our roads and in the neighborhoods we serve. Our efforts continue to yield solid driver safety scores and further reinforce the culture of safety we strive to promote throughout our company. We continue to look for ways to modernize our company, and to that end, our Board of Directors recently amended and restated our bylaws to transition from a classified board structure to a declassified one. Going forward, board members that are up for reelection will be elected to one year terms. This step aligns with corporate governance best practices. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. Demand from our customers remained strong with over 7% organic growth in the quarter, and for the first half of the year. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 20,000 plus teammates around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Ken. Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Good morning. So, Ashish, this is Jerry. So, when we look at the quarter, I'll start with the two fewer working days in June. I mean, that was a pretty significant impact for us in the quarter. You're in the thick of your peak season right in the middle of the year to have two or fewer workdays. More than anything, even though we had a bit of a softer June last year, it affected productivity fairly significantly about ability to get work done and things along those lines. So, I would much rather have those two extra days in a June than I would in an April very early, very early in the quarter. So that's interesting. And there was some impact there. The recurring business is the additions to our new customer growth are actually outpacing our organic revenue growth. So that's healthy. So, when you think about the consumer side of it, the one-time business, while it's still there, it may be a little softer on some of the residential pest control, but we still see a very strong consumer in the marketplace. That consumer, when you look at our termite and ancillary growth in the double-digit range, that tells you, you still have a healthy consumer that really is staying in their home. There's a lot less relocation going on. People are staying at home, investing in their homes and certainly buying things like pest control and adding that to their home services. That is still remaining very, very healthy. So, we haven't really seen any shift from a consumer side in that regard either. Would you add anything to that, Ken? We -- I don't think we've seen necessarily a stronger demand in certain verticals. What -- where we're getting our results is by building the biggest and best salesforce on the commercial side that we can -- that is possible out there. We continue to add to our salesforce, invest in their training, invest in development and building a very strong cohesive team on the commercial sales side. That's really what's paying dividends, not necessarily one vertical or another. I think we're out there just trying to capture new business through the new people that we're adding to our team. Thank you, Ashish. Yeah. I don't think it was greater in certain segments than others, necessarily. Although, my intuition tells me it affected us more in the residential pest and then maybe a little bit on the termite and ancillary because those are often larger jobs that take time to get, take time to complete. And when you talk about having two fewer days in a month, in a month like June, it will result in some of that work carrying over, not being completed into July. That last year would have been completed in June. So, it's really that kind of impact, more probably on the residential, both pest, and termite and ancillary than on the commercial side. That's exactly right, Ken. We don't really see any headwinds that could have some significant impact on what we continue to see. Yeah. I've given up a long time ago trying to predict the weather and what bugs are going to do and pests are going to do about the weather. And so, generally speaking, warmer weather is good for business, but you just never know how fast that could change. If you recall back last year in June, we went through that cold spell and a little bit of June that softened for a couple of weeks there. And then in July, it picked back up and things went crazy again. So, you just kind of never know what's in store in terms of the weather. And we really don't think too much about the weather. In terms of the cicadas, Ashish is probably still listening. He asked about the cicadas. They're typically, to a consumer, not a pest, not a while they are a perceived pest problem. It's not something we can do much about. As I mentioned, you're talking about millions, potentially trillions of cicadas, and the extent that you would have to go through to quiet them down would be pretty extreme. That's not something we necessarily do. Instead, we've chosen to have a little fun with it, create some consumer demand and build some brand recognition around the attention that the cicadas are getting. Not really a pest problem, however. On the weather -- just adding on the weather, you are right. You see statistics about warming environment and things like that. But the other side of it is you just never know what hurricane season might look like here. As you get into August and September, I think a lot of people are predicting a pretty tough hurricane season. So that could have a disruption, a short-term disruption, but you just never know. I mean, overall, when we look at the things we control and we look at what we're doing, we feel good about the demand levels that we're seeing across our business. Yes, dynamic. And to the point of, like when you look at this quarter and you try to understand the impact of that, you saw a little bit less, you saw some leverage in our selling and marketing costs. And some of that was in the advertising area, as we had pointed out in our presentation that's posted online. What we're seeing, though, is we're ramping that investment here into Q3, and so to take advantage of that longer shoulder season. And so, we're expecting to see a bit of an uptick in these advertising efforts here as we go throughout July because the markets are very healthy for us. I don't think any of the channels are necessarily any better or any worse. I think we're doing well in all of them. And it's really about having a balanced approach, balance of how you spend, making sure that we're spending our money wisely, getting the return on investment that we want. We don't want to just drive leads for the sake of driving leads where we don't have the capacity to fulfill the demand and all those things come into play. So, I think our brands and our businesses have done a pretty good job of ensuring that what we do, we're disciplined about, we execute to it and we measure our results and we measure our return on investment. So, it's been pretty solid across all those channels. I think -- Ken, we've seen pretty solid growth across the business. Geographically, I wouldn't say there's been any significant difference where there's some market that's radically lagging another market or part of the country or even international. So, I would say generally across the board, it tends to be fairly healthy. Yeah. And usually if you see those differences, it usually comes on the edges, the back edges of those shoulder seasons, or in the wintertime when extreme weather may impact it more is usually when we see more of those differences geographically. Thank you, Josh. Yes, they've both been really good performance for us here, especially in the quarter. Continue to see good demand levels. Thank you. Morning."

I will now turn the conference over to Lyndsey Burton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nLyndsey Burton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In addition to the earnings release that we issued yesterday, the company has also prepared a supporting slide presentation. The earnings release and presentation are available on our website at www.rollins.com. We have included certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our discussion this morning. The non-GAAP reconciliations are available in the appendix of today's presentation as well as in our earnings release. \n The company's earnings release discusses the business outlook and contains certain forward-looking statements. These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that have been made on this call, excluding historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from any statement we make today. Please refer to yesterday's press release and the company's SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n On the line with me today and speaking are Jerry Gahlhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Krause, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Management will make some opening remarks, and then we'll open the line for your questions. Before I turn it over to Jerry, I want to remind everyone of our upcoming Investor Day on May 17 in New York City. We're looking forward to hosting the investment community and discussing our strategies for growing our business and driving value for our stakeholders. Jerry, would you like to begin? \nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the first quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of nearly 14% to $748 million. We delivered healthy organic growth of 7.5% in the quarter despite some unfavorable and erratic weather in January compared to last year, which Ken will discuss in more detail. \n Overall, we continued to see double-digit revenue growth across all major service lines as total Residential revenue increased 16.5%, Commercial rose 11.4% and Termite was up 11.7% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business.\n As you would expect, we invested in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities ahead of peak season to ensure that we are well positioned and top of mind for the consumer as pet season begins. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front, so that people are onboarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. \n On the commercial side of the business, we are leveraging analytics to identify areas in the market where opportunity warrants additional resources. And this continues to pay dividends as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit commercial growth.\n We continue to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and are leveraging our training and sales tools to better enable their success as well. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of closing the Fox acquisition, and that team has performed exceptionally well. We anticipate that Fox will continue to positively impact organic growth and profitability as we go forward. \n We closed 12 tuck-in deals in the first 3 months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw a healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure and drove efficiencies throughout the business. \n Safety remains an important area of focus for us and efforts to enhance safety coaching, training and protocols resulted in higher driving safety scores and fewer recorded safety incidents when compared to a year ago. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. This year is off to a solid start, and demand from our customers remains strong with over 7% organic growth in the first quarter.\n Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy, and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 19,000-plus team members around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. \n Before I hand it over to Ken, I'd like to announce a few changes to our Board of Directors. First, we would like to thank Jerry Nix, who recently retired from our Board, for his service to our company. We've been so fortunate to have Jerry as our Lead Director for the past several years. His experience, wisdom and guidance helped us navigate uncharted waters for our company, and we're incredibly grateful for the significant contributions he's made along the way. \n Second, we would like to welcome Dale Jones, who was elected to our Board at a recent shareholder meeting. Additionally, Louise Sams has been appointed as our new Lead Independent Director. We're excited about the level of expertise and experience that both Dale and Louise will bring to our Board in their new roles. Ken, I'll now turn the call over to you. \nKenneth Krause: Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start. Growth was robust at the start of the year. We delivered revenue growth of 13.7% year-over-year. Organic growth was 7.5%, and we saw significant improvement moving throughout the quarter as organic revenue growth accelerated to over 10% for February and March. \n Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up a healthy 130 basis points with strong gross profit performance and solid expense leverage despite incremental investments aimed at growing our business. Cash flow continues to be very strong with free cash flow increasing 29%, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. \n Diving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. In the first quarter, residential revenues increased 16.5%, commercial pest control rose 11.4% and termite and ancillary increased by 11.7%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 4.3% in residential, 10.1% in commercial and 9.3% in termite and ancillary. \n As Jerry mentioned, our residential organic growth was impacted by a slower start in January. To provide context, February and March total organic growth was a very strong 10.8% versus 7.5% for the quarter. And looking at residential revenue specifically, February and March organic growth was a healthy 8% versus 4.3% for the quarter. We are pleased with the consistent growth we continue to see across the business. \n Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were healthy at 51.2%, up 90 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 40 basis points, organic margin improved 50 basis points as we saw nice leverage from people cost, fleet and materials and supplies. \n Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. We saw healthy leverage from administrative-related costs which enabled reinvestment and incremental advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives that Jerry discussed. \n First quarter GAAP operating income was $132 million, up 18% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $138 million, up nearly 23% versus prior year on approximately 14% total revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up 130 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins, coupled with solid expense leverage. First quarter EBITDA was $160 million, up over 14% and representing a 21.3% margin, up 10 basis points versus last year.  \n You'll recall that last quarter, we called out a negative impact to adjusted EBITDA due to lower nonoperational gains versus the comparable period in the prior year. We saw a similar dynamic in the first quarter as well. Given that we do from time to time, divest nonoperational assets, we have made the decision to exclude gains and losses on these types of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are measures of operating performance, and this change will allow us to better compare our underlying performance more consistently over time.  \n A table showing the revised metrics for fiscal 2023 is included in our earnings release. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, up 19% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.5% was strong, improving 100 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Incremental adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%, a healthy result considering that Q1 is a slower period and can have a lower profitability profile as we invest ahead of our busier seasons. The effective tax rate was approximately 24% in the quarter, in line with the prior year.  \n Quarterly GAAP net income was $94 million or $0.19 per share, increasing from $0.18 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. \n Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $98 million or $0.20 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest cost on the higher debt balances versus the comparable period.\n Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 27% in the quarter to $127 million. We generated $120 million of free cash flow, a 29% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 120% for the quarter. \n We made acquisitions totaling $47 million, and we paid $73 million in dividends, both up versus the same period a year ago. Debt-to-EBITDA leverage is well below 1x on a gross and net level, and our balance sheet is very healthy and positions us well to continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities.  \n In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our teams. Demand is healthy and our acquisition pipeline provides us a sense of optimism. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. \nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question is from Timothy Mulrooney with William Blair. \nTimothy Mulrooney: So just stepping back here, with trends accelerating in February and March. I just wonder if folks are going to extrapolate that 10% organic growth rate into the next several months and quarters. I mean 10% to me just sounds like touch on the strong side. So I wonder if that's how you're thinking about things or if expectations are better level set to kind of what we saw over the last several quarters, more in that 7% to 8% range for organic growth. \nKenneth Krause: Thanks for the question, Tim. I appreciate that. And when looking at the business, we certainly did see some improvements as we went throughout the quarter. But one quarter is certainly not a long-term trend. We are continuing to remain very confident in our outlook, and that outlook is really anchored around 7% to 8% sort of growth rate that we've consistently talked about. That stepped up, as you all know, since COVID, and we continue to benefit from that higher growth rate and more favorable operating environment. But yes, I think 7% to 8% is kind of how we think about the business from an organic basis going forward. \nTimothy Mulrooney: That's really helpful. Thank you, Ken. And this is not a follow-up. It's a completely separate topic, but I'm going to do it anyway. The step-up in sales and marketing expense, okay? I think there's a couple of different ways folks could interpret that, either as more of a defensive move, because you're having to spend more, maybe on digital marketing to win customers or more as an offensive move, hiring more sales folks for future growth, for example. Could you just double click into that increase in sales and marketing expense column? And help us understand that decision a little better to ramp up spend there? \nJerry Gahlhoff: Tim, this is Jerry. A lot of that cost really lied on the heavier side on the selling expense as it relates to us staffing up. Let me give you a couple of examples, a couple of data points. Just looking at Orkin alone, when we looked compared to prior year in the first quarter, we had over 50 more commercial account managers at Orkin alone. We had over 100 more home sales inspectors at Orkin in the first quarter of this year than we did the last year. \n So that's where a lot of our investment continues to be. We see that opportunity. That's what I referred to as the feet on the street opportunity. So our sales salaries are up there. It's not necessarily some sort of targeted defensive marketing spend. It's an offensive sales mobilization and really building out your sales team for the growth opportunities ahead. \nOperator: Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: I wanted to dive into trends that you're seeing in the residential business. It sounds like most of the impact to organic revenue growth in residential was due to unfavorable January weather, leading to the 4% organic growth. I wanted to see if there were any other trends you would call out there? I know last quarter, you highlighted onetime sales impact. So any changes there and other operating items to consider as it relates to the organic growth in residential? \nKenneth Krause: Certainly. When we look at the residential business, we look at the residential business very broadly across our residential services as well as our termite and ancillary. Across that portfolio, the business continues to perform very well. Onetime business can be choppy. It continues to be choppy. But generally, demand for our services remains very healthy. \n As I indicated in my prepared commentary, what we saw when we look just at the residential business alone, we saw an improvement, 4.3% growth for the quarter but close to 8% growth as we look at February and March. So we continue to see really good demand levels for our business. \nJerry Gahlhoff: I would add to that, George, that when we think about some of the onetime business as well, as Ken mentioned, it's usually choppier in the shoulder seasons when weather -- that's an area of the business that weather can impact more so than anything, but you still have your recurring customer base that's there to service. But we also continue to see really strong health in our onetime ancillary business that really shows that a consumer side of it is strong and the consumers continue to be willing to invest in protecting their homes. \nKeen Fai Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then within the termite and ancillary services business, organic growth seems to have decelerated a bit to 9% compared to 11% in 4Q. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes that could have led to that performance? \nKenneth Krause: Certainly, when you unpack the termite business, there's 2 components to the termite and ancillary. There is your normal recurring termite business, your pretreat business, and then you have ancillary business in there as well. We're seeing really good demand across the spectrum. Our business, our recurring bait monitoring business, continues to grow at a very healthy level, but also our ancillary business in that area continues to grow as well at a nice rate. So it's really a broad-based growth that we're seeing in demand for our services. \nKeen Fai Tong: Okay. Got it. Any factors that could have caused the deceleration in organic revenue growth there? \nJerry Gahlhoff: I look at it from a productivity standpoint. We continue to -- the sales are there, the working the backlog can be a challenge. And in the quarter -- and that goes back to a January type of phenomenon, where we had more branches and operations closed for multiple days compared to the prior year. And that affects productivity and ability to get the work done, even if our sales force is out there selling and they're out there continuing to do what they do and building that backlog of work to get done. \n And so the work is there for us to get done. So we're optimistic about that. It's not a selling issue. It's us getting all the workload done in a given period of time. So when you carry a backlog over into the second quarter, things still look healthy. That helps, to add any color. \nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nUnknown Analyst: On for Stephanie Moore. I just wanted to touch on commercial organic growth that's been pretty strong over the last few quarters. And I know you mentioned leveraging analytics and things like that, but I was just curious if there's anything else to call out? And if you could kind of talk about the sustainability of growth there? \nJerry Gahlhoff: I know it sounds like a broken record and we've said this now for a few years. We just continue to invest in our sales staff, getting them ramped up and being successful. That B2B sales process is a relationship type of sale. It's got a long selling cycle, and you got to be patient, you got to invest. You got to invest in training and sales tools and supporting those new account managers when they're brought up to get them ramped up and brought to speed just as fast as possible.  \n That is the more you add in the sales force and the more investments you make to make them successful. We just continue to see that opportunity there. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than being committed to continue to add incrementally to our sales force. \nKenneth Krause: It's interesting. When I step back and I look at the financials, and I look at the trend in spend across different categories of SG&A, Jerry is spot on, sales salaries continues to be an area that we continue to invest disproportionately in. We're saving money in some of the back office costs and admin areas, but we continue to invest pretty heavily on the front end of our business and taking a very offensive perspective on our business. \nUnknown Analyst: Just on the resi side, have you guys seen any slowdown? Anything that's meaningful related to the new business wins or a sort of meaningful pickup in customer churn and maybe lower household income areas? And then just anything you could share around how April is kind of shaping up so far? \nJerry Gahlhoff: We haven't seen any significant change from a retention issue one way or the other. So that remains pretty solid and any color on April... \nKenneth Krause: It would be very difficult to grow our business at the rate we're growing if we saw [ chiding ] in customer churn. And so customer churn, although it is not [ chiding ], it still remains an opportunity for us to continue to improve. When we look at April, we continue to see healthy levels of demand. We're starting April strongly. But again, we continue to think about a 7% to 8% sort of organic growth rate across the business as we think about the future. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ David Pedron ] for Ashish. In terms of capital allocation, now that you've lapped the Fox acquisition, how should we think about I guess, your M&A pipeline in terms of larger deals or smaller deals going forward, especially given this robust free cash flow that you keep generating? \nKenneth Krause: When we look at the pipeline, it's very healthy. It's very balanced. There's opportunities across the spectrum with respect to M&A. Something that we have consistently said, however, for 2024, is that we do think that 2% to 3% of revenue growth is probably a realistic expectation of contribution from M&A. \n We continue to look at deals. We continue to evaluate deals. And in fact, in Q1, we spent roughly $45 million to $50 million on M&A, and that was up considerably year-over-year. Of course, last year, we were preparing for Fox. But I think it just shows that there continues to be a very healthy pipeline of M&A in a very fragmented market that we continue to compete in. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Josh Chan with UBS. \nJoshua Chan: So I guess you mentioned that 7% to 8% is sustainable growth rate. And given how strong commercial and termite is, does that imply that you expect residential to kind of remain in this 4% range going forward? Just curious how you're thinking about how the different businesses contribute to that 7% to 8%. \nKenneth Krause: It's interesting when you start to put a fine point on that, but we do think that probably commercial and termite and ancillary will probably grow a little bit faster than the overall average and resi might grow a little bit slower. You just have puts and takes across the portfolio. It doesn't mean that we're not bullish in residential, but I just think that, that's generally how the growth profile has unfolded over time for us. \nJerry Gahlhoff: Yes, I agree with you, Ken. I think it's hard to predict that. I mean, there's going to be movement in any of those categories potentially based on a number of factors and where it all comes out in that 7% to 8% total. \nJoshua Chan: Yes. Okay. That helps [indiscernible] color there. And then on your decision to accelerate investment during the off season. Sometimes you focus on the peak season to invest, sometimes you invest ahead of the season. So could you just talk about the rationale for investing ahead of the season this year, what you're seeing and what opportunities you expect to realize? \nKenneth Krause: Yes. As we had talked about, I mean, the business started to grow pretty nicely on a year-over-year basis, organic basis in February and into the March. And so we saw that, and we saw an opportunity to pull forward some investments. It doesn't mean that we're going to invest any lighter in Q2. In fact, we're going to continue to invest in Q2 and drive further growth. \n The market opportunity is there and you've got to invest when that market opportunity is there. This is a very short cycle business. And when you see weather patterns that improve or demand trends that might change, you have to be ready to invest. And so I think that's just -- it's just reflective of our investment and our interest in investing in growth across our portfolio. \nJerry Gahlhoff: We had a lot more carrying costs from people side in late fourth quarter and certainly in the first quarter than I think we've ever had. The reality is it's certainly harder to find people and then with the level of intensity that we put and the time and energy that we put into training and development upfront, that takes time to have people ready. And so our strategy has been to get ahead of that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ollie Davies with Redburn Atlantic. \nOliver Davies: Just 2 for me. So firstly, can you just talk about the level of price increases you're putting through? And if you're seeing any pushback on the residential side, just given the level of volume growth in the first quarter. And then secondly, in terms of -- probably one for Ken just in terms of the SG&A. I mean, obviously, the admin expenses, I guess some of that is coming from the modernization that you did last year. So how sustainable are they going forward through this year, and I guess, your ability to reinvest that? \nKenneth Krause: So looking at your questions, thank you for your questions. The first question with respect to pricing, it's interesting. When we step back and we look at this business, I think recently, you've heard me start to talk about this as a CPI-plus type of business. So we think this service is certainly an essential service and should command CPI-plus level pricing. So 3% to 4% this year is certainly -- it's something we passed along, and we're seeing it stick. We just feel like the service is just too valuable, not to price it at those levels. \n And then secondly, when you look at the SG&A levels across the business, it's good to see the improvements that we're seeing in our cost structure. I think in the quarter, we talked about a 20 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales. But when you unpack that, you see that we spent roughly 50 basis points more on growth-oriented investments but 70 basis points less of back office costs. \n And I think that's representative of the work we're doing to improve the effectiveness and the productivity of our business. We feel like there's more to come, but we certainly are happy with the progress we're making there. \nOperator: And our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. \nAshish Sabadra: Sorry, [indiscernible] again. Apologies if I missed this one, but what was the exit growth for residential? I believe the 10% was for the entire company, but what was it for resi? \nKenneth Krause: Yes, it was 10.8% to put a fine point on it for the entire company. And for residential, it was 8%. \nJerry Gahlhoff: For February and March. \nKenneth Krause: Yes, for February and March. Yes. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments. \nJerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you all at our upcoming investor conference. Thanks again. \nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Kenneth Krause",
            "content": "Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter reflects continued strong execution by the Rollins team. A few highlights to start. Growth was robust at the start of the year. We delivered revenue growth of 13.7% year-over-year. Organic growth was 7.5%, and we saw significant improvement moving throughout the quarter as organic revenue growth accelerated to over 10% for February and March. \n Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up a healthy 130 basis points with strong gross profit performance and solid expense leverage despite incremental investments aimed at growing our business. Cash flow continues to be very strong with free cash flow increasing 29%, enabling a balanced capital allocation strategy. \n Diving further into the quarter, we saw good growth across each of our service offerings. In the first quarter, residential revenues increased 16.5%, commercial pest control rose 11.4% and termite and ancillary increased by 11.7%. Organic growth was also healthy across the portfolio, with growth of 4.3% in residential, 10.1% in commercial and 9.3% in termite and ancillary. \n As Jerry mentioned, our residential organic growth was impacted by a slower start in January. To provide context, February and March total organic growth was a very strong 10.8% versus 7.5% for the quarter. And looking at residential revenue specifically, February and March organic growth was a healthy 8% versus 4.3% for the quarter. We are pleased with the consistent growth we continue to see across the business. \n Turning to profitability. Our gross margins were healthy at 51.2%, up 90 basis points versus last year. We continue to be positive on the price cost equation and saw good performance across several key cost categories. While Fox was accretive to gross margins for the quarter by about 40 basis points, organic margin improved 50 basis points as we saw nice leverage from people cost, fleet and materials and supplies. \n Quarterly SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 basis points versus last year. Excluding the earnout adjustment for the Fox acquisition, SG&A cost as a percentage of revenue decreased by 20 basis points in the quarter. We saw healthy leverage from administrative-related costs which enabled reinvestment and incremental advertising and selling expenses associated with growth initiatives that Jerry discussed. \n First quarter GAAP operating income was $132 million, up 18% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $138 million, up nearly 23% versus prior year on approximately 14% total revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins were 18.4%, up 130 basis points year-over-year on strong gross margins, coupled with solid expense leverage. First quarter EBITDA was $160 million, up over 14% and representing a 21.3% margin, up 10 basis points versus last year.  \n You'll recall that last quarter, we called out a negative impact to adjusted EBITDA due to lower nonoperational gains versus the comparable period in the prior year. We saw a similar dynamic in the first quarter as well. Given that we do from time to time, divest nonoperational assets, we have made the decision to exclude gains and losses on these types of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are measures of operating performance, and this change will allow us to better compare our underlying performance more consistently over time.  \n A table showing the revised metrics for fiscal 2023 is included in our earnings release. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, up 19% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.5% was strong, improving 100 basis points driven by leverage across the P&L. Incremental adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%, a healthy result considering that Q1 is a slower period and can have a lower profitability profile as we invest ahead of our busier seasons. The effective tax rate was approximately 24% in the quarter, in line with the prior year.  \n Quarterly GAAP net income was $94 million or $0.19 per share, increasing from $0.18 per share in the same period a year ago. For the first quarter, we had non-GAAP pretax adjustments associated with the Fox acquisition-related items totaling approximately $5 million of pretax expense in the quarter. \n Accounting for these expenses, adjusted net income for the quarter was $98 million or $0.20 per share, increasing over 17% from the same period a year ago despite the higher level of interest cost on the higher debt balances versus the comparable period.\n Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 27% in the quarter to $127 million. We generated $120 million of free cash flow, a 29% increase versus last year. Cash flow conversion, the percent of income that was converted into operating cash flow was well above 120% for the quarter. \n We made acquisitions totaling $47 million, and we paid $73 million in dividends, both up versus the same period a year ago. Debt-to-EBITDA leverage is well below 1x on a gross and net level, and our balance sheet is very healthy and positions us well to continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities.  \n In closing, our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the engagement level of our teams. Demand is healthy and our acquisition pipeline provides us a sense of optimism. We remain focused on providing our customers with the best customer experience and driving growth both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry. Thanks for the question, Tim. I appreciate that. And when looking at the business, we certainly did see some improvements as we went throughout the quarter. But one quarter is certainly not a long-term trend. We are continuing to remain very confident in our outlook, and that outlook is really anchored around 7% to 8% sort of growth rate that we've consistently talked about.

In fact, we're going to continue to invest in Q2 and drive further growth. \n The market opportunity is there and you've got to invest when that market opportunity is there. This is a very short cycle business. And when you see weather patterns that improve or demand trends that might change, you have to be ready to invest. And so I think that's just -- it's just reflective of our investment and our interest in investing in growth across our portfolio. So looking at your questions, thank you for your questions.

            "content": "Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the first quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of nearly 14% to $748 million. We delivered healthy organic growth of 7.5% in the quarter despite some unfavorable and erratic weather in January compared to last year, which Ken will discuss in more detail. \n Overall, we continued to see double-digit revenue growth across all major service lines as total Residential revenue increased 16.5%, Commercial rose 11.4% and Termite was up 11.7% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business.\n As you would expect, we invested in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities ahead of peak season to ensure that we are well positioned and top of mind for the consumer as pet season begins. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front, so that people are onboarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers. \n On the commercial side of the business, we are leveraging analytics to identify areas in the market where opportunity warrants additional resources. And this continues to pay dividends as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit commercial growth.\n We continue to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and are leveraging our training and sales tools to better enable their success as well. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of closing the Fox acquisition, and that team has performed exceptionally well. We anticipate that Fox will continue to positively impact organic growth and profitability as we go forward. \n We closed 12 tuck-in deals in the first 3 months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw a healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure and drove efficiencies throughout the business. \n Safety remains an important area of focus for us and efforts to enhance safety coaching, training and protocols resulted in higher driving safety scores and fewer recorded safety incidents when compared to a year ago. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. This year is off to a solid start, and demand from our customers remains strong with over 7% organic growth in the first quarter.\n Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy, and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 19,000-plus team members around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers. \n Before I hand it over to Ken, I'd like to announce a few changes to our Board of Directors. First, we would like to thank Jerry Nix, who recently retired from our Board, for his service to our company. We've been so fortunate to have Jerry as our Lead Director for the past several years. His experience, wisdom and guidance helped us navigate uncharted waters for our company, and we're incredibly grateful for the significant contributions he's made along the way. \n Second, we would like to welcome Dale Jones, who was elected to our Board at a recent shareholder meeting. Additionally, Louise Sams has been appointed as our new Lead Independent Director. We're excited about the level of expertise and experience that both Dale and Louise will bring to our Board in their new roles. Ken, I'll now turn the call over to you. Thank you, Ken. We're happy to take any questions at this time. Tim, this is Jerry. A lot of that cost really lied on the heavier side on the selling expense as it relates to us staffing up. Let me give you a couple of examples, a couple of data points. Just looking at Orkin alone, when we looked compared to prior year in the first quarter, we had over 50 more commercial account managers at Orkin alone. We had over 100 more home sales inspectors at Orkin in the first quarter of this year than we did the last year. \n So that's where a lot of our investment continues to be. We see that opportunity. That's what I referred to as the feet on the street opportunity. So our sales salaries are up there. It's not necessarily some sort of targeted defensive marketing spend. It's an offensive sales mobilization and really building out your sales team for the growth opportunities ahead. I would add to that, George, that when we think about some of the onetime business as well, as Ken mentioned, it's usually choppier in the shoulder seasons when weather -- that's an area of the business that weather can impact more so than anything, but you still have your recurring customer base that's there to service. But we also continue to see really strong health in our onetime ancillary business that really shows that a consumer side of it is strong and the consumers continue to be willing to invest in protecting their homes. I look at it from a productivity standpoint. We continue to -- the sales are there, the working the backlog can be a challenge. And in the quarter -- and that goes back to a January type of phenomenon, where we had more branches and operations closed for multiple days compared to the prior year. And that affects productivity and ability to get the work done, even if our sales force is out there selling and they're out there continuing to do what they do and building that backlog of work to get done. \n And so the work is there for us to get done. So we're optimistic about that. It's not a selling issue. It's us getting all the workload done in a given period of time. So when you carry a backlog over into the second quarter, things still look healthy. That helps, to add any color. I know it sounds like a broken record and we've said this now for a few years. We just continue to invest in our sales staff, getting them ramped up and being successful. That B2B sales process is a relationship type of sale. It's got a long selling cycle, and you got to be patient, you got to invest. You got to invest in training and sales tools and supporting those new account managers when they're brought up to get them ramped up and brought to speed just as fast as possible.  \n That is the more you add in the sales force and the more investments you make to make them successful. We just continue to see that opportunity there. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than being committed to continue to add incrementally to our sales force. We haven't seen any significant change from a retention issue one way or the other. So that remains pretty solid and any color on April... Yes, I agree with you, Ken. I think it's hard to predict that. I mean, there's going to be movement in any of those categories potentially based on a number of factors and where it all comes out in that 7% to 8% total. We had a lot more carrying costs from people side in late fourth quarter and certainly in the first quarter than I think we've ever had. The reality is it's certainly harder to find people and then with the level of intensity that we put and the time and energy that we put into training and development upfront, that takes time to have people ready. And so our strategy has been to get ahead of that. For February and March. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you all at our upcoming investor conference. Thanks again."
